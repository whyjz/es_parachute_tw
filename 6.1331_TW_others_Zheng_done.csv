2011.0,AAPG Mem.,Two contrasting kinematic styles of active folding above thrust ramps western taiwan,Yue L;Suppe J;Hung J,"Two adjacent active thrust ramps in western Taiwan show contrasting hanging-wall structural geometries that suggest different kinematics, although they involve the same stratigraphic section and basal detachment. The Chelungpu thrust shows a classic fault-bend folding geometry, which predicts folding by kink-band migration without limb rotation, whereas the hanging wall of the Changhua thrust shows the characteristic geometry of a shear fault-bend folding, which predicts a progressive limb rotation with minor kink-band migration. We test the kinematic predictions of classical and shear fault-bend folding theories by analyzing deformed flights of terraces and coseismic displacements in the 7.6 moment magnitude scale Chi-Chi earthquake. In particular, differences in terrace uplift across active axial surfaces are used to show that the assumptions of classical fault-bend folding are closely approximated, including constant fault-parallel displacement, implying conservation of bed length, and hanging-wall uplift rates that are proportional to the sine of the fault dip. This provides a basis for precise determination of total fault slip because the formation of each terrace, combined with terrace dating, gives long-term fault-slip rates for the Chelungpu thrust system. Even the coseismic displacements of 3 to 9 m (10 to 29 ft) in the Chi-Chi earthquake are approximately fault parallel but have additional transient components that are averaged out over the time scale of terrace deformation, which represents 10-100 large earthquakes. In contrast, terrace deformation in the hanging wall of the Changhua thrust ramp shows progressive limb rotation, as predicted from its shear fault-bend folding geometry, which combined with terrace dating allows an estimation of the long-term fault-slip rate of 21 mm/yr (0.83 in./yr) over the last 31 ka. A combined shortening rate of 37 mm/yr (1.46 in./yr) is obtained for this part of the western Taiwan thrust belt, which is about 45% of © 2011 by The American Association of Petroleum Geologists.","Department of Geosciences, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, United States; Department of Geosciences, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Earth Sciences, National Central University, Jhongli, Taiwan",USA;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,USA,USA,3,2.0,,"Yue, L.-F.; Department of Geosciences, , Princeton, NJ, United States",,NA NA NA,,10.1306/13251337M943431,Article,coseismic process;  deformation;  detachment fold;  displacement;  earthquake event;  earthquake magnitude;  fault geometry;  fault slip;  folding;  kinematics;  seismic moment;  terrace;  thrust fault;  uplift; Changhua;  Chelungpu Fault Zone;  Taiwan,,AAPG Memoir,18,,scopus,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY;NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY;NATIONAL CENTRAL UNIVERSITY,DEPARTMENT OF GEOSCIENCES,A

These national forests have two main functions: timber production and public benefit. The public benefit includes conservation of land, protection of the natural environment, and recreation. The goal of species selection is to find suitable species that will grow and develop into a healthy forest. A prototype expert system was developed for species selection in Taiwan's national forests. This expert system utilizes information about many environmental factors, including latitude, altitude, topography, air temperature, and soil type, as well as species-specific attributes such as tree growth and timber price. -from Authors","Dept. of Forestry, National Taiwan Univ., Taipei, 10764 Taiwan, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,,2,1.0,,,,NA NA,,,Article,afforestation;  developing country;  expert system;  forest;  forest management;  national forest;  reforestation;  reforestation scheme;  resources management;  species selection;  technological application; Taiwan,,AI Applications in Natural Resource Management,2,5,scopus,,,A
2010.0,Am. J. Sci.,ACCRETIONARY OROGEN AND EVOLUTION OF THE JAPANESE ISLANDSIMPLICATIONS FROM A SrNd ISOTOPIC STUDY OF THE PHANEROZOIC GRANITOIDS FROM SW JAPAN,Jahn B,"The Japanese Islands represent a segment of a 450 Ma old subduction-related orogen developed along the western Pacific convergent margin, and most tectonic units are composed of late Paleozoic to Cenozoic accretionary complexes and their high P/T metamorphic equivalents. The formation of the Japanese Islands has been taken as the standard model for an accretionary orogeny. According to Maruyama (1997), the most important cause of the orogeny is the subduction of an oceanic ridge, by which the continental mass increases through the transfer of granitic melt from the subducting oceanic crust to the orogenic belt. Sengor and Natal'in (1996) named the orogenic complex the ""Nipponides,"" consisting predominantly of Permian to Recent subduction-accretion complexes with veil, few fragments of older continental crust. These authors pointed out the resemblance in orogenic style between Japan and the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB). The present work uses new and published Sr-Nd isotopic data from the literature to test the statements made by these authors. A large proportion of the granitoids from SW Japan have high initial Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios, negative epsilon(Nd)(T) values and Proterozoic Sm-Nd model ages. The Japanese isotopic data are in strong contrast with those of two celebrated accretionary orogens, the Central Asian Orogenic Belt and Arabian-Nubian Shield, but are quite comparable with those observed in SE China and Taiwan, or in classical collisional orogens in the European Hercynides and Caledonides. This raises questions about the bulk composition of the continental crust in SW Japan, or the type of material accreted in accretionary complexes, and negates the hypothesis that the ""Nipponides"" contains very few fragments of older continental crust. The subduction-accretion complexes in Japan are composed mainly of recycled continental crust, probably of Proterozoic age. This study supports the idea that proto-Japan was initially developed along the southeastern margin of the South China Block.","Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei 11529, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,1,1.0,,"Jahn, BM (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, POB 13-318, Taipei 106, Taiwan.","NSC-TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [96-2116-M-001-004, 97-2752-M-002-003-PAE, 97-2116-M-001-011, 98-2116-M-001-009]","This article is dedicated to Professor Alfred Kroner, a highly distinguished scholar and long-time friend, in honor of his 70<SUP>th</SUP> birthday.

2021.0,Am. J. Sci.,Terrestrial biomarker isotope records of late Quaternary climate and source-to-sink sediment transport processes in southwestern Taiwan,Chang Q;Hren M;Lin A;Tabor C;Yu S;Eley Y;Harris G,"Fluvial sediments are important archives of paleoenvironments. However, variations in sediment production and transport processes greatly influence sediment geochemistry and resultant interpretations of ancient conditions. Tectonically-active tropical regions are particularly sensitive to climate feedbacks because these areas are often characterized by high precipitation rates, rapid erosion and short sediment residence times. We analyzed the hydrogen and carbon isotope composition of plant-derived n-alkanes (delta H-2(n-alkone) and delta C-13(n-alkone)) in sediment cores along the Gaoping River-submarine canyon system in southwestern Taiwan to examine climatic and geomorphic controls on isotope geochemical signatures of fluvial sedimentary archives. These records span the last similar to 26 kyr and provide critical insight into the temporal and spatial variations in sedimentary biomarker isotopes within a source-to-sink system. Isotope data are coupled with new results from an iCESM 1.2 Earth System Model of precipitation isotopes during the last glacial-interglacial cycle. Biomarker isotope and modeling results support two important conclusions . First, biomarker isotope values change by similar to 10 to 15 parts per thousand in delta H-2(n-alkone) and similar to 1 to 2 parts per thousand delta C-13(n-alkone) in offshore SW Taiwan through the late Quaternary deglaciation. These shifts arc consistent with iCESM predictions and other records from the South China Sea and are best explained by a shift in isotope hydrology due to regional warming and biologic responses to increased atmos- pheric pCO(2). Second, the ane of biomarkers preserved in onshore sediments proximal to the mountain range is similar to 15 to 20 parts per thousand more negative than biomarker deposited in offshore sites, and the temporal change in carbon isotopes exceeds that observed in the offshore deposits. The onshore core locality is proximal to the orogen and characterized by a mean elevation > 1 km compared to the offshore site, which has a mean catchment elevation of similar to 500 m. These data show that depositional setting and catchment hypsoinetry strongly bias the geochemical signature of sediments transported through the river system. The magnitude of isotopic variability generated by catchment geometry and sediment integration greatly exceeds the change associated with warming during deglaciation. This result suggests that catchment integration processes may play a similar or larger role in shaping fluvial geochemical records in tropical mountain systems than climatic factors.","Univ Connecticut, Dept Geosci, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.;  Natl Cent Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.;  CPC Corp, Explorat & Dev Res Inst, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Univ Birmingham, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.;",USA;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;UNITED KINGDOM,USA,USA,7,2.0,2.0,"Chang, QN (corresponding author), Univ Connecticut, Dept Geosci, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.","US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [EAR-1752815, EAR-1650396]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [AGS-1804747]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF); National Center for Atmospheric Research -NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO) [1852977]","We thank Nemiah Ladd, Zhonghui Liu, and Guangsheng Zhuang for helpful comments that improved this manuscript.

A total of 293 senior tourists from Taiwan were surveyed and asked to indicate the amount of influence each family member and 'others' had. Results showed that husbands tend to have the most influence in the final purchase, and one interesting finding is that 'others' exhibit the highest degree of influence in the information search stage. In addition, the husband shows more influence in 9 subdecisions, and as family income level rises there is a rise in the likelihood of husband dominating with respect to the group package tour.

2020.0,Ann. Am. Assoc. Geogr.,Pacing for Renewable Energy Development The Developmental State in Taiwans Offshore Wind Power,Chien K,"Since the 2008 global financial crisis, a green economy has been promoted as a way to foster sustainable development and eradicate poverty at the same time. Many states have become more active in investing in renewable technologies and allocating capital to renewable energy development. With the rapid growth of the green economy in East Asian countries (e.g., China, South Korea, and Taiwan), however, there is a strong state presence in green economic development. These East Asian developmental states have gone beyond capital allocation and fostering new technologies. Furthermore, the developmental states have invented or reinvented with new means and measures to intervene in the building of a green economy. This article thus focuses on how the Asian developmental state has evolved through renewable energy development. By employing Taiwan’s offshore wind power development as a case study, this article stresses three main arguments. First, although Taiwan’s developmental state has become more restricted under neoliberalization, policy tools have been reinvented or altered to fulfill the objective of local industrial development in Taiwan. Second, the state intervenes in new energy industry development not merely through policy tools, but also its control over infrastructures. Third, by treating offshore wind power development as a green societal mission, the state is thus able to reunite its developmentalist drive for growth with the rising environmentalist demand for energy transition, sustaining its dominant role in the emerging green economy.

In Taiwan, where the further development of nuclear power is suspended due to public antinuclear sentiment, offshore wind farms have been heavily promoted as a way of meeting electricity demand. The planned site for offshore wind farms, mainly the intertidal zone along the coast of Changhua County, overlaps with both oyster farms and the habitat of Taiwanese humpbacked dolphins, categorized as a critically endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. This has resulted in a clash between conserving the oyster farming landscape, protecting an endangered species, and developing green energy. Facing this dilemma, pro–wind farm discourses that highlight concerns about global climate change have gradually supplanted those stressing the welfare of oysters and dolphins, even though the latter have been used successfully as local icons by movements opposing previous development projects on the intertidal zone. This article reconsiders the politics of territorialization implied by the “green” label affixed to offshore wind farm projects and other forms of green energy in general. As such, the meaning of offshore wind farms, as a newly discovered energy resource, is intertwined with the changing meanings of both dolphins and oyster farms, as rival nonhuman objects of resource exploitation and natural conservation. The territorialization of such resources in the emerging discursive space of green energy has proceeded via relational placemaking with nonlinear connections among multiple human and nonhuman elements.

AFASI is the major mapping agency on Taiwan responsible for the production of basic topographic maps as well as a wide range of thematic maps for the island. By the late 1970s urban and regional planning had acquired great importance in Taiwan, following completion of regional plans for the whole island in 1979 (Chang 1984; Sun and Tsai 1981). Rapid urban and industrial growth was encroaching on agricultural lands at an alarming rate and the government recognized the need for developing the means to protect the existing agricultural base from further losses, or at least from undesired losses of prime agricultural land. The basic objective became control over urban and rural land use changes. To achieve that objective required accurate and up-to-date information about land use in the lowlands of the island. AFASI was charged by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, with the support of the Ministry’s Council for Agricultural Planning & Development (currently the Council of Agriculture under the Executive Yuan), to determine the existing land use patterns for all of the lowlands of Taiwan by the most accurate and rapid means possible and to produce large-scale maps of those patterns for use by agencies concerned with agricultural and other development plans.

2012.0,Ann. Assoc. Am. Geogr.,Population Movement and VectorBorne Disease Transmission Differentiating SpatialTemporal Diffusion Patterns of Commuting and Noncommuting Dengue Cases,Wen T;Lin M;Fang C,"Commuters who acquire dengue infections could be an important route for the transmission of the virus from their homes to workplaces. Understanding the effects of routine human movement on dengue transmission can be helpful in identifying high-risk areas for effective intervention. This study investigated the effects of local environmental and demographic characteristics to clarify the role of the daily commute in dengue transmission. We analyzed the clustering patterns of space-time distances between commuting and noncommuting dengue cases from June 2007 to January 2008 in Tainan City, Taiwan. We also analyzed the network topology of space-time distances to identify possible key individuals and conducted time-to-event analysis for geographic diffusion through commuting versus noncommuting dengue cases. Our significant findings indicate that most of the space-time distances of noncommuting cases clustered within 100 m and one week, whereas commuting cases clustered within 2 to 4 km and one to five weeks. Analysis of the temporality of the geographical diffusion by villages showed that commuting cases diffuse more rapidly across villages than noncommuting cases in the late epidemic period. The role of commuting was identified as a significant risk factor contributing to epidemic diffusion (hazard ratio: 3.08, p value < 0.05). Local neighborhood characteristics (number of vacant grounds and empty houses) are independent facilitating factors for diffusion through both noncommuting cases and commuting cases (hazard ratio: 1.035 and 1.022, respectively, both p < 0.05). Higher population density is a significant risk factor only for diffusion through commuters (hazard ratio: 1.174). In summary, noncommuters, mostly elderly adults and housewives, might initiate local outbreaks, whereas commuters carrying the virus to geographically distant areas cause large-scale epidemics. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Department of Geography, College of Science, National Taiwan University, No. 1, Sec. 4, Roosevelt Road, Taipei, 10617, Taiwan; Graduate Institute of Health Policy and Management, College of Public Health, National Taiwan University, No. 17 Xu-Zhou Road, Taipei, 10020, Taiwan; Graduate Institute of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, College of Public Health, National Taiwan University, No. 17 Xu-Zhou Road, Taipei, 10020, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,,"Wen, T.-H.; Department of Geography, No. 1, Sec. 4, Roosevelt Road, Taipei, 10617, Taiwan; 電子郵件: wenthung@ntu.edu.tw","National Science CouncilNational Science Council, NSC, 98-2410-H-002-168- MY2 National Taiwan UniversityNational Taiwan University, NTU","This research was supported by grants from the National Science Council (NSC 98-2410-H-002-168- MY2) and financial support provided by the Infectious Diseases Research and Education Center, Department of Health, and National Taiwan University.

Early research had mostly dealt with personal experience, which lacked holistic thinking and resolving. In recent years, researchers who believed SDS as a social phenomenon began study using Social Network Analysis and observed the role played by organizational networks during the process of SDS to explain how organizational networks affected SDS. While there exist few studies on SDS between units and persons within an organization, and past research lacked effective methods of message gathering and filtering from the targeted organizations, this study proposed the empirical method and dimensions, unlike before, to understand and promote SDS from various aspects. After observation on organizational process of SDS over a long period, this article gathered empirical data on the behaviours of SDS in Taichung City Government over 17 years and explained the sharing structure model of spatial data in organizational network by Social Network Analysis and Graph Theory.

2001.0,Appl. Geochem.,Comparative study of sterols in shelf and slope sediments off northeastern Taiwan,Jeng W;Huh C,"Bottom sediments and suspended matter from the shelf and slope areas off northeastern Taiwan were analyzed for sterol, n-alkanol and n-alkane compositions. The Sigma (algal sterols/cholesterol) ratios (mean +/- 1 sigma) were 1.00 +/- 0.31 (n = 7) for the shelf sediments, 3.29 +/- 0.61 (n = 7) for the slope sediments, and 1.54 +/- 0.19 (n = 3) for the suspended matter. The much higher proportion of cholesterol in the shelf sediments is most likely derived from mollusks in the relict sediments. An additional sterol source for the shelf sediments probably is suspended matter in the water column although the shelf has no apparent sedimentation. Results from phytol and n-alkanols suggest recent inputs of lipids from the water column to the shelf. The stanol/stenol ratios are lower for the older shelf sediments than for the younger slope sediments. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

2004.0,Appl. Geochem.,Geochemistry of mud volcano fluids in the Taiwan accretionary prism,You C;Gieskes J;Lee T;Yui T;Chen H,"Taiwan is located at the collision boundary between the Philippine Sea Plate and the Asian Continental Plate and is one of the most active orogenic belts in the world. Fluids sampled from 9 sub-aerial mud volcanoes distributed along two major geological structures in southwestern Taiwan, the Chishan fault and the Gutingkeng anticline, were ana-lyzed to evaluate possible sources of water and the degree of fluid-sediment interaction at depth in an accretionary prism. Overall, the Taiwanese mud volcano fluids are characterized by high Cl contents, up to 347 mM, suggesting a marine origin from actively de-watering sedimentary pore waters along major structures on land. The fluids obtained from the Gutingkeng anticline, as well as from the Coastal Plain area, show high Cl, Na, K, Ca, Mg and NH4, but low SO4 and B concentrations. In contrast, the Chishan fault fluids are much less saline (1/4 seawater value), but show much heavier 0 isotope compositions (delta(18)O = 5.1-6.5 parts per thousand). A simplified scenario of mixing between sedimentary pore fluids and waters affected by clay dehydration released at depth can explain several crucial observations including heavy O isotopes, radiogenic Sr contents (Sr-87/Sr-86=0.71136-0.71283), and relatively low salinities in the Chishan fluids. Gases isolated from the mud volcanoes are predominantly CH4 and CO2, where the CH4-C isotopic compositions show a thermogenic component of delta(13)C = -38 parts per thousand.. These results demonstrate that active mud volcano de-watering in Taiwan is a direct product of intense sediment accretion and plate collision in the region. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

2007.0,Appl. Geochem.,Dissolved constituents and Sr isotopes in river waters from a mountainous island The Danshuei drainage system in northern Taiwan,Chu H;You C,"Taiwan is a typical active orogenic belt situated at the collision boundary between the Eurasian Continental Plate and the Philippine Sea Plate. Dissolved major and trace constituents, as well as Sr and Sr isotopes in river waters collected from the Danshuei River basin in northern Taiwan have been studied to evaluate chemical weathering processes. The results of principal component analysis show that the ion sources in these river waters can be categorized into 3 major components: chemical weathering, seasalt contribution and local anthropogenic input. The chemical weathering is the most dominant factor that contributes about 85% of total variances. Significantly increased Na/Cl and Ca/Cl, as well Sr-87/(86) Sr, were observed in most upper stream samples. The Na/Cl and Ca/Cl ratios in the Dahan Stream, however, are much higher than the Shindien Stream. Even though average rainfall is stronger in the Shindien drainage basin, chemical evidence from river waters supports less intense weathering in the region. Selective dissolution of secondary calcites explains the observed high Ca/Cl, Sr/Cl and Ca/Na in the Dahan Stream. These results highlight the potential importance of tectonic factors, such as uplift and physical erosion in studying chemical weathering in an active orogenic belt. The variations of Sr-87/(86) Sr in the Danshuei River are quite large, reflecting some strata that released Sr. Most of the upstream waters exhibit more radiogenic Sr-87/Sr-86, 0.713243-0.714338, due to weathering of ambient low-grade metamorphic rocks, 0.71678-0.72216. The distributions of Cl, Sr and Sr-87/Sr-86 in the main stream were affected by somewhat conservative mixing with sources varing between ambient rocks and seasalt. In the upper Dahan Stream, heavy Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios were coincident with large deviations of Na/Cl from the average seawater value, as high as 40. The degree of chemical weathering in ambient rocks plays a dominant role in affecting the distribution of Sr and Sr-87/Sr-86 in the Danshuei River. This isotopic characteristic makes Sr-87/Sr-86 an invaluable tracer for studying source mixing, migration pathways and chemical weathering in an active orogenic belt. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

2007.0,Appl. Geochem.,Factors responsible for high arsenic concentrations in two groundwater catchments in Taiwan,Wang S;Liu C;Jang C,"High As contents in groundwater were found in two neighboring catchments - the Chianan plain and the southern Choushui river alluvial fan in Taiwan. The groundwater quality, the redox potential and the As distribution of the Chianan plain were characterized using factor analysis, redox zoning and a geochernical program. The results were compared with those of the southern Choushui river alluvial fan. Possible As release mechanisms are also elucidated. Factors I and 2 of the groundwater in the Chianan plain - the salinization factor and the As enrichment factor - are similar to those in the southern Choushui river alluvial fan. However, the spatial distribution of reductive tendency in the Chianan plain is different to that in the Choushui river alluvial fan, and yields spatially distinct hydrogeochemical environments in these two neighboring areas. The reduction potential in the Chianan plain is stronger than that in the Choushui river alluvial fan. The difference between the reduction potentials in these two vicinal areas influences the concentrations of As in groundwater. The reductive dissolution of As-rich Fe oxyhydroxide is suggested to be the major mechanism for release of As to the groundwater in the Chianan plain and the Choushui river alluvial fan of Taiwan.

2008.0,Appl. Geochem.,Identification of sources and causes of leakage on a zoned earth dam in northern Taiwan Hydrological and isotopic evidence,Peng T;Wang C,"Seepage through an earth dam body must be regulated as a well-planned process, if it is not properly managed, the abnormal seepage may cause dam failure. This study employed stable isotopic and statistical methods to identify the source and cause of an abnormal leakage on the zoned earth dam of the Xin-Shan reservoir located in northern Taiwan. Water samples from the dam area over a 2-a period were collected and analyzed for their stable 0 and H isotope compositions. In addition, a 4-a period of hydrological data, including rainfall, reservoir level, well level, seepage of filter drainage and leakage, were statistically analyzed with a stepwise multiple regression approach. Both the stable isotopic and hydrological results indicate that the abnormal leakage on the dam shell comes from the filter drainage in the dam. The reason for abnormal leakage is due to unexpected and significant precipitation-sourced water flowing into the dam's body. The dam filter fails to drain out the incoming water sufficiently, thus generating the abnormal seepage. In addition. the defect in the dam filter may also cause the drainage filter to drain off reservoir seepage inadequately. Therefore, it is suggested that checking the filter function and preventing excessive precipitation-sourced water from flowing into the dam are the two top priorities for the follow-up remedial strategy of the dam.

2009.0,Appl. Geochem.,Geochemical characteristics of the fluids and muds from two southern Taiwan mud volcanoes Implications for watersediment interaction and groundwater arsenic enrichment,Liu C;Jean J;Nath B;Lee M;Hor L;Lin K;Maity J,"Mud volcanoes distributed in the southern part of Taiwan are believed to be sourced from an accretionary prism located along the collision boundary between the Philippine Sea plate and the Asian Continental plate. Fluid and mud samples have been collected from Wushanting and Hsiaokunshui mud volcanoes during October 2004, March and June 2005, and analyzed for major ions, trace elements, and stable isotopes. The results show that the mud volcano fluids are enriched in Na+ and Cl- but are depleted in Ca2+ and Mg2+. The chemical composition and oxidation state of the fluids fluctuate seasonally, with ionic contents being notably higher during the dry pre-monsoon period. The enriched ionic (e.g., Na+, NH+, K+, Mg2+ and Cl-) compositions of the exchangeable fractions indicate that the muds were sourced from a marine depositional environment. delta D and delta O-18 values indicate that the mud volcano fluids may have been modified by chemical exchange with O-18-rich crustal rocks and possibly originated from mixing of deep brines with circulating meteoric water. The spatial and temporal distribution of ions in the muds suggests a varied mixing regime within the mud volcanoes. incubation study of the muds shows the leaching of soluble salts under aerobic conditions, which is generally consistent with the fluid geochemical characteristics. Moreover, elevated trace element (e.g., As, Zn, Cu and Mn) concentrations are also observed in the fluids and muds. Geochemical correlations between As, Zn and Cu in the muds suggest prevailing SO4-reducing conditions at depth. The relatively low Eh values (range: -50 to -30 mV) of the fluids near the surface would favor bacterial Fe reduction and mobilization of As. The dewatering of mud volcanoes may represent a significant source of groundwater As in the nearby Chianan plain. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

2010.0,Appl. Geochem.,Gases in Taiwan mud volcanoes Chemical composition methane carbon isotopes and gas fluxes,Chao H;You C;Sun C,"Mud volcanoes are important pathways for CH4 emission from deep buried sediments; however, the importance of gas fluxes have hitherto been neglected in atmospheric source budget considerations. in this study, gas fluxes have been monitored to examine the stability of their chemical compositions and fluxes spatially, and stable C isotopic ratios of CH4 were determined, for several mud volcanoes on land in Taiwan The major gas components are CH4 (>90%), ""air"" (i.e. N-2 + O-2 + Ar, 1-5%) and CO2 (1-5%) and these associated gas fluxes varied slightly at different mud volcanoes in southwestern Taiwan. The Hsiaokun-shui (HKS) mud volcano emits the highest CH4 concentration (CH4 > 97%) On the other hand, the Chung-lun mud volcano (CL) shows CO2 up to 85%, and much lower CH4 content (<37%) High CH4 content (>90%) with low CO2 (<0.2%) are detected in the mud volcano gases collected in eastern Taiwan. It is suggestive that these gases are mostly of thermogenic origin based on C-1 (methane)/C-2 (ethane) + C-3 (propane)and delta C-13(CH4) results, with the exception of mud volcanoes Situated along the Gu-ting-keng (GTK) anticline axis showing unique biogenic characteristics Only small CH4 concentration variations, <2%, were detected in four on-site short term field-monitoring experiments, at Yue-shi-jie A, B, Kun-shui-ping and Lo-shan A. Preliminary estimation of CH4 emission fluxes for mud volcanoes on land in Taiwan fall in a range between 980 and 2010 tons annually If soil diffusion were taken into account, the total amount of mud volcano CH4 Could contribute up to 10% of total natural CH4 emissions in Taiwan.

2010.0,Appl. Geochem.,Magmatic fluids of Tatun volcanic group Taiwan,Ohba T;Sawa T;Taira N;Yang T;Lee H;Lan T;Ohwada M;Morikawa N;Kazahaya K,"Two distinctive magmatic fluids were recognized in the Tatun volcanic group (TVG), Taiwan. One is a relatively reduced fluid represented by the fumarolic gases at Hsiao-you-ken (HYK) geothermal field. Another is an oxidized fluid containing high concentrations of HCI represented by the fumarolic gases at Da-you-ken (DYK). An intermediate gas was recognized at Gung-tze-ping (GTP) and She-hung-ping (SHP). The fumarolic gases at HYK and GTP possess the features of so-called primary steam generated on mixing of magmatic gas and meteoric groundwater. The fumarolic gases at DYK are a simple mixture between magmatic gas and water vapor of meteoric origin. The CO(2)/H(2)O molar ratio of the magmatic component in the fumarolic gases at DYK was estimated to be 0.018, meanwhile it was estimated to be 0.027 for the fumarolic gases at HYK and GTP, suggesting the magma beneath DYK is depleted in volatiles relative to the magma beneath HYK and GTP. The estimated CO(2)/H(2)O ratio for the magmatic component is comparable to that of some active volcanoes in Japan, suggesting the enrichment of volatiles in the magmas beneath TVG.

2010.0,Appl. Geochem.,Nitrogen as the carrier gas for helium emission along an active fault in NW Taiwan,Hong W;Yang T;Walia V;Lin S;Fu C;Chen Y;Sano Y;Chen C;Wen K,"Variations of He gas concentration are widely applied in studies devoted to the location of faults and to monitor seismic activities. Up to now, its migration mechanism in soil is not fully understood. A systematic soil gas survey across an active fault in NW Taiwan provides the opportunity to closely examine the mechanism of He migration in the fault zone. Significant spatial and temporal correlations observed between soil N-2 and He gas support the hypothesis that N-2 is the probable carrier gas for He emission in the studied area. Based on N-2/Ar ratios and N-2 isotopic results, the excess soil N-2 in this study is considered to be largely derived from ancient atmospheric air which was dissolved in groundwater. Furthermore, observations rule out the possibility of CO2 being the dominant carrier gas for He in the studied area based on the C and He isotopic compositions and the relationship between concentrations of these gases. At least two soil gas sources. A and B, can be identified in the studied area. Source A is an abiogenic gas source characterized by excess N-2 and He, and very low O-2 and CO2 content. Source B, on the other hand, is a mixture of biogenic gas and atmospheric air. The development of the fault system is an important factor affecting the degree of mixture between sources A and B. Therefore, variations of soil gas composition, in particular those derived from source A, could be a useful proxy for tracing faults in the area. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

2010.0,Appl. Geochem.,Primary sink and source of geogenic arsenic in sedimentary aquifers in the southern Choushui River alluvial fan Taiwan,Lu K;Liu C;Wang S;Jang C;Lin K;Liao V;Liao C;Chang F,"This work characterized the sink and source/mobility of As in the As-affected sedimentary aquifers of the southern Choushui River alluvial fan, central Taiwan. Major mineral phases and chemical components were determined by XRD and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The partitioning of As and Fe among cores were determined by sequential extraction. Based on XPS results, the primary forms of Fe were hematite, goethite and magnetite. Sequential extraction data and the XRF analysis indicated that Fe oxyhydroxides and sulfides were likely to be the major sinks of As, particularly in the distal-fan. Furthermore, Fe oxyhydroxides retained higher As contents than As-bearing sulfides. The reductive dissolution of Fe oxyhydroxides, which accompanied high levels of HCO3- and NH4+ concentrations, was likely the principal release mechanism of As into groundwater in this area. The dual roles of Fe oxyhydroxides which are governed by the local redox condition act as a sink and source in the aquifer. Ionic replacement by PO43- and HCO3- along with seasonal water table fluctuation, caused by monsoons and excessive pumping, contributed specific parts of As in the groundwater. The findings can be used to account for the inconsistency between Fe and As concentrations observed in groundwater. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The present research is aimed finding the relationship between soil gas distribution and tectonic systems in the vicinity of the Hsinhua Fault zone in the Tainan area of Southern Taiwan. More than 110 samples were collected along 13 traverses to find the spatial distribution of Rn, He, CO(2) and N(2). The spatial congruence of all the gases shows that N(2) is the most probable carrier gas of He, whereas CO(2) seems to be a good carrier gas of Rn in this area. From the spatial distribution of Rn, He, CO(2) and N(2) the trace of Hsinhua Fault and neotectonic features can be identified. The spatial distribution of studied gases shows a clear anomalous trend ENE-SWS along the Hsinhua Fault. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Using observations from the Southern Alps of New Zealand, and Taiwan, we have mapped this organic pathway to geological carbon sequestration, and can evaluate the magnitude and efficiency of transfers between sources and sinks. We demonstrate that POC is harvested by landsliding, but importantly also by common and widespread surface runoff on steep hill-slopes. Although terrestrially sourced POC is found in many sedimentary environments associated with mountain belts and frontier basins, it appears to be most abundantly trapped and preserved in marine turbidites. The loss of all forms of POC in onward transport through short, steep routing systems to this repository is limited. This is in marked contrast to larger routing systems, in which only the most resilient forms of POC survive into long-term deposition. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Geochem.,Geochemical characterization of arsenicaffected alluvial aquifers of the Bengal Delta West Bengal and Bangladesh and Chianan Plains SW Taiwan Implications for human health,Nath B;Maity J;Jean J;Birch G;Kar S;Yang H;Lee M;Hazra R;Chatterjee D,"Major ion and trace element analyses were performed on groundwater samples collected from the Bengal Delta (Chakdaha municipality, West Bengal and Manikgonj town, Bangladesh) and Chianan Plains (SW Taiwan) to compare geochemical characteristics. Results showed that concentrations of Na, K. Mg, Cl and SO4 were generally higher in Chianan Plain (CNP) groundwaters, while high Ca was observed in Bengal Delta Plain (BDP) groundwater. Measured As concentrations in groundwaters of BDP and CNP showed large variations, with mean As concentrations of 221 mu g/L (range: 1.1-476 mu g/L) in Chakdaha, 60 mu g/L (range: 0.30-202 mu g/L) in Manikgonj, and 208 mu g/L (range: 1.3-575 mu g/L) in CNP groundwater. The Fe-reduction mechanism was found to be the dominant geochemical process in releasing As from sediment to groundwater in Chakdaha, West Bengal, however the Mn-reduction process was dominant in groundwaters of Manikgonj, Bangladesh. In Chianan Plain groundwater, a combination of geochemical processes (e.g., bacterial Fe-reduction, mineral precipitation and dissolution reactions) controlled release of As. Fluorescence spectral patterns of the groundwater showed low relative fluorescence intensity (RFI) of dissolved humic substances in BDP groundwater (mean: 63 and 72 QSU, Chakdaha and Manikgonj, respectively), while high RFI was observed in CNP groundwater (mean: 393 QSU). The FT-IR spectra of the extracted humic acid fractions from sediments of Chianan Plain showed a stronger aliphatic band at 2850-3000 cm(-1) and a higher resolved fingerprint area (from 1700 to 900 cm(-1)) compared with BDP sediments. The geochemical differences between the study areas may play a crucial role in the clinical manifestation of Blackfoot disease observed only in Chianan Plain, SW Taiwan. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

2012.0,Appl. Geochem.,Influence of waterfall aeration and seasonal temperature variation on the iron and arsenic attenuation rates in an acid mine drainage system,Chen C;Jiang W,"Dramatic seasonal changes in water chemistry and precipitate mineralogy associated with acid-mine drainage (AMD) in the waterfall and creek sections of the Chinkuashih area, northern Taiwan were investigated. Special attention has been paid to the kinetic effects of seasonal temperature variation and waterfall aeration. Precipitation of schwertmannite associated with removal of metals and As are indicated by delicate growth microstructures on precipitate surfaces, X-ray diffraction data, and downstream reductions of metal and As concentrations. Geochemical modeling suggested a downstream increase of the degree of saturation/supersaturation with respect to schwertmannite in the waterfall section, which can be attributed to high Fe2+ oxidation rates. The waterfall section was characterized by high rates and model rate constants of Fe2+ oxidation (6.1-6.7 x 10 (6) mol L (1) s (1) and 2.7-2.9 x 10 (2) s (1)) and Fe (schwertmannite) precipitation (1.7-2.1 x 10 (6) mol L (1) s (1) and 3.5-4.1 x 10 (7) mol L (1) s (1)). A high As sorption rate (4.7-6.3 x 10 (9) mol L (1) s (1)) and low As distribution coefficient (7.9-11.8 x 10 (9) mol (1) L) were observed. The creek section showed up to 1-2 orders of magnitude slower rates and lower rate constants than the waterfall section and had seasonal variations comparable to those in areas polluted by AMD elsewhere. The summer rates were 4-5 times higher than the winter rates in the creek section, and are largely attributed to a temperature effect. In contrast, the seasonal differences in rate and rate constant were small in the waterfall section. Several factors associated with the waterfall aeration in addition to elevated temperature and As concentration enhanced Fe and As attenuation in the waterfall section. The waterfall effects on Fe precipitation rate were enhanced when the flow rate was large in the winter. Despite the remarkable removal of metals and As by the rapid precipitation of As-bearing schwertmannite, large effluent loads of potentially hazardous contaminants including As, Cu and Zn discharged to the sea in the Chinkuashih area.

2013.0,Appl. Geochem.,The sources and fluxes of dissolved chemistry in a semiconfined sandy coastal aquifer The Pingtung Plain Taiwan,Martin C;Galy A;Hovius N;Bickle M;Lin I;Horng M;Calmels D;Chen H,"Groundwater chemical fluxes from the Pingtung Plain in SW Taiwan to the ocean were determined by analysing waters from 43 wells at varying depths through a 237 m deep window across the Pingtung Plain, for major dissolved cations, anions, dissolved SiO2, and stable isotopic composition of O and H, and computing their subsurface water fluxes from measurements of hydraulic heads and formation permeabilities. The results show that between 1.5% (SO42-) and 12.3% (Ba2+) of the total chemical weathering flux discharged to the ocean (Kaoping River combined with groundwater) can be attributed to the groundwater. Estimated propagated errors at 1 sigma on subsurface fluxes are +/- 20%. Multi-year daily hydraulic head data give the direction of groundwater flow through the plain, and indicate that pumping has led to episodic reversals of flow, facilitating seawater intrusion in the near-coast aquifer. Tracing end-member proportions using mixing relationships shows that, in addition to seawater and meteoric water, hot-spring activity contributes to the dissolved chemistry of the groundwater. In addition to these three end-members, the weathering of carbonate and silicate minerals in the plain accounts for the remainder of the chemical budget. Hydrological connectivity exists throughout the drilled depth of the basin, but chemical gradients show that flow is stratified, with up to a twofold increase in silicate-derived Na+ seen in deeper horizons as compared to the near surface. For all ions except SO42-, the average concentrations of dissolved species in the coastal groundwaters exceed those of the river, ranging from a factor of 1.33 in the case of Li+ to 27.29 in the case of Cl-. The results suggest that submarine groundwater chemical fluxes through the drilled depth of the Pingtung Plain into the Taiwan Strait are modest in comparison to those related to surface runoff.

2011.0,Arab. J. Geosci.,Principal component analysis method in the detection of total electron content anomalies in the 24 hrs prior to large earthquakes,Lin J,"The goal of this research is to examine one-dimensional total electron content (TEC) data using principal component analysis (PCA) to search for total electron content (TEC) anomalies associated with large earthquakes in 24 h prior to nucleation. The characteristics of principal eigenvalues generated for TEC prior to 24 earthquakes of magnitude scale M a parts per thousand yenaEuro parts per thousand 5.0 and 6 lesser earthquakes of magnitude scale M < 5 that occurred in Taiwan from 01 January 2000 to 31 December 2001 are examined. In an earlier paper, I was able to confirm the statistical findings of Liu et al. (J Geophys Res 111, 2006) that sparse earthquake-associated TEC anomalies existed in 5 days prior to the 12 large earthquakes they examined (Lin, Terr Atm Ocean Sci, 2010). In this paper, I wish to examine the subtlety of principal component analysis in detecting earthquake-associated TEC anomalies by examining if such precursors can be detected in 24 h prior to large earthquakes. Of the earthquakes examined, TEC anomalies given by clear extreme principal eigenvalues were evident within 24 h of nucleation for 21 of the 24 earthquakes of M a parts per thousand yenaEuro parts per thousand 5.0. After making allowance for the general status of background TEC, it is clear that these extreme principal eigenvalues are representative of earthquake-associated anomalies. For the smaller earthquakes (M < 5), it was not possible to differentiate earthquake-associated anomalies from background effects on TEC status. These new findings confirm the validity of PCA in searching for earthquake-associated TEC anomalies and show that it is subtle enough to detect TEC anomalies within 24 h leading to a large earthquake. If this approach continues to prove successful, it could theoretically be used in real-time prediction of large earthquakes through early detection of earthquake-associated TEC anomalies.","Tech Univ Clausthal, Inst Geophys, D-38678 Clausthal Zellerfeld, Germany.;  Kaohsiung Municipal Jhong Jheng Ind High Sch, Kaohsiung 806, Taiwan.;",GERMANY;TAIWAN,GERMANY,GERMANY,1,2.0,,"Lin, JW (corresponding author), Tech Univ Clausthal, Inst Geophys, D-38678 Clausthal Zellerfeld, Germany.",,,One-dimensional total electron content (TEC); Principal component analysis (PCA); Precursors; Real-time prediction,10.1007/s12517-010-0204-4,Article,IONOSPHERIC PRECURSORS,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES,8,4,ISI,TECH UNIV CLAUSTHAL;KAOHSIUNG MUNICIPAL JHONG JHENG IND HIGH SCH,TECH UNIV CLAUSTHAL,A
2014.0,Arab. J. Geosci.,Lyophilized particles and ethanolic extracts of Antrodia cinnamomea mycelia suppress the tumorigenicity of head and neck cancer cells in vivo,Chang C;Chen Y;Chen C;Chen C;Sheu S;Lin T;Lee T;Lo J,"Head and neck cancer (HNC) is one of the most common forms of cancer in Taiwan. In addition, head and neck cancer cells (HNCs) are highly tumorigenic and resistant to conventional therapy. Therefore, development of new therapeutic regimens that are adjuvant to conventional treatments would benefit future head and neck cancer therapy. In this study, we found that the lyophilized particles and ethanolic extracts of Antrodia cinnamomea mycelia inhibited the tumor growth of HNCs by xenograft assay in vivo. Moreover, administration of lyophilized particles or ethanolic extracts to nude mice did not cause significant side effects. Our study revealed that the Antrodia cinnamomea mycelia extract (ACME) efficiently inhibited the tumorigenicity of HNCs without causing organ failure. Furthermore, it showed that ACME may work as a novel drug candidate for alternative treatments for head and neck cancer. © 2014, Springer Verlag, All rights reserved.","Institute of Oral Biology, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, 112, Taiwan; Department of Biotechnology, Hungkuang University, Taichung, 433, Taiwan; Grape King Inc, Taoyuan County, 320, Taiwan; Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei, 115, Taiwan; Graduate Institute of Chinese Medical Science and Institute of Medical Science, China Medical University, Taichung, 404, Taiwan; Genome Research Center, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, 112, Taiwan; Department of Dentistry, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, 112, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;CHINA;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,8,1.0,,"Lo, J.-F.; Institute of Oral Biology, No. 155, Section 2, Li-Nong Street, Taiwan","101J041, YM99C021 10187 National Science CouncilNational Science Council, NSC, NSC100-2314-B-040-001, NSC100N446, NSC101N050, NSC99N024 National Yang-Ming UniversityNational Yang-Ming University, NYMU, 100ACT513, 100ACT807, 101ACT513, 102ACTC14, 99ACT303-2 Taipei Veterans General HospitalTaipei Veterans General Hospital, V99ER2-006, VGHUST99-P6-39","The authors thank Dr. K-W Chang (Department of Dentistry, National Yang-Ming University) for providing critical comments.

2015.0,Arab. J. Geosci.,A novel study on antbased clustering for paddy rice image classification,Chang S;Wan S,"Paddy rice is the major crop of food in Taiwan. There are three main contributions of rice cultivation on Taiwan: regional eco-friendly of environments, adjustment of floods, and refreshing the air. The estimation of paddy rice crop area is important since this information is related to the national food policy, yearly crop yields calculation, and post-disaster reimbursement. In the past, a large amount of human power and time-consuming works are performed through field exploration and rice pattern revising. A more economic manner to estimate paddy rice area is desired. Accordingly, this study aims to design a paddy rice classifier by which the evaluation of paddy rice area in a remote sensing image can be rationally performed. In this study, the ant-based clustering optimization (ACO) algorithm is used to present image classification on paddy rice mapping. The advantage of this algorithm is that it can effectively cluster data into groups through unsupervised learning. The ACO implementation can be organized to the following steps: (a) initialize the number of ants, (b) compute the pheromone trail matrix of ants, (c) update the pheromone trail matrix, (d) select the best few ants that have the optimal object function value, and (e) repeat iterations until termination criteria are satisfied. In the meantime, self-organizing map (SOM) clustering was used as a parallel study for comparison. A classifier for paddy rice pattern discernment was built as well as paddy rice thematic maps are drawn. The result shows that ACO clustering algorithm has a higher accuracy than that of SOM.","Ling Tung Univ, Informat Networking & Syst Adm, Taichung, Taiwan.;  Ling Tung Univ, Informat Management, Taichung, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,,"Wan, SA (corresponding author), Ling Tung Univ, Informat Management, Taichung, Taiwan.",,,Ant-based clustering; Image classification; Self-Organization map,10.1007/s12517-014-1617-2,Article,DECISION TREE; OPTIMIZATION; MODELS,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES,3,8,ISI,LING TUNG UNIV;LING TUNG UNIV,LING TUNG UNIV,A

The ground damage caused by the Chi-Chi earthquake still influences successive rainfall-triggered landslides. The landslide distribution triggered by heavy rainfall during typhoon Mindulle in 2004 has a high correlation to the landslide sites triggered by the previous Chi-Chi earthquake. This research calculated and ordered landslide data for both the area and distance from the Chelungpu fault. The rank correlation coefficient for measuring two covarying variables is employed to quantify the degree of correlation between the landslide distribution and the Chelungpu fault. A high rank correlation coefficient value demonstrates a highly correlated relationship between the subsequent landslides in 2004 and previous Chelungpu fault activity in 1999.","Tamkang Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Islamic Azad Univ, Nour Branch, Young Researchers & Elite Club, Nour, Iran.;  Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Engn, GISRC, Dept Civil Engn, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia.;  Natl Pingtung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Soil & Water Conservat, Pingtung, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;IRAN;MALAYSIA;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,IRAN,5,1.0,0.0,"Pourghasemi, HR (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Nour Branch, Young Researchers & Elite Club, Nour, Iran.",,,Chi-Chi earthquake; Landslide; GIS; Remote sensing; Rank correlation coefficient; Taiwan,10.1007/s12517-014-1435-6,Article,ANALYTICAL HIERARCHY PROCESS; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; HOA BINH PROVINCE; SUSCEPTIBILITY ASSESSMENT; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; GOLESTAN PROVINCE; FREQUENCY RATIO; FUZZY-LOGIC; MODELS; GIS,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES,5,8,ISI,TAMKANG UNIV;ISLAMIC AZAD UNIV;UNIV PUTRA MALAYSIA;NATL PINGTUNG UNIV SCI AND TECHNOL,ISLAMIC AZAD UNIV,B2
2016.0,Arab. J. Geosci.,Landslide characteristics in the area of Xiaolin Village during Morakot typhoon,Deng Y;Tsai F;Hwang J,"Xiaolin, a small village in southern Taiwan, was completely buried by a deep-seated landslide during the extreme rainfall of Typhoon Morakot in 2009, and 500 people were killed. This disaster caused great public concern. This study examines the rainfall-induced landslide characteristics in the area and their correlations with various susceptibility factors. We emphasize the importance of producing an accurate landslide inventory using visual interpretation and propose a new systematized set of subcategories of susceptibility factors, especially stream factors. We used satellite images, digital elevation models, and landslide inventories from before and after the disaster to perform spatial analysis using geographic information system (GIS) tools. Of the topographical factors considered, only slope aspect was important, and the landslides bore little relation to tectonic lines. The stream factors had the strongest influence on these landslides. Almost 100 % of the landslide area was related to various types of erosion caused by the stream network. Most of the large-scale landslides were induced by headward erosion, and all occurred on dip or oblique slopes. Thus, a combination of dip or oblique slope types and stream factors resulted in more landslides, which suggests that landslides are often induced by a combination of multiple factors.","Natl Cent Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Taoyuan, Taiwan.;  Natl Cent Univ, Ctr Space & Remote Sensing Res, Taoyuan, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,0.0,"Hwang, JH (corresponding author), Natl Cent Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Taoyuan, Taiwan.",,,Typhoon Morakot; Landslide characteristics; Xiaolin village; Visual interpretation; Geographic information system; Streamfactors,10.1007/s12517-016-2342-9,Article,RAINFALL-INDUCED LANDSLIDES; STATISTICAL APPROACH; SHALLOW LANDSLIDES; CAUSATIVE FACTORS; LANTAU ISLAND; RIVER-BASIN; EVENT; INVENTORIES; FREQUENCY; PATTERNS,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES,7,9,ISI,NATL CENT UNIV;NATL CENT UNIV,NATL CENT UNIV,B2

2018.0,Archaeol. Anthropol.

Until now, quite limited archaeobotanical work has been done in this region. In eastern Taiwan, no archaeological evidence of rice agriculture has been obtained, probably owing to the poor preservation conditions for plant macroremains. Here, we report a new discovery of 4200-year-old domesticated rice remains at the Chaolaiqiao site, which for the first time in detail demonstrates the ancient practice of rice agriculture in this area. Based on a combination of factors that include a rice-based plant subsistence strategy, the mid-Holocene limits to available farmland and the fast-growing Taiwan Neolithic population from settlement pattern data, we infer that this contradiction in eastern Taiwan between land-dependent agriculture and limited suitable farmland encouraged a population movement out of Taiwan during the Middle Neolithic period.","Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geol & Geophys, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.;  Australian Natl Univ, Dept Archaeol & Nat Hist, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.;  Univ Guam, Micronesian Area Res Ctr, UOG Stn, 303 Univ Dr, Mangilao, GU 96913 USA.;  Australian Natl Univ, Sch Archaeol & Anthropol, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.;  Natl Museum Prehist, Taidong 95060, Taiwan.;  Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.;  Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.;",CHINA;AUSTRALIA;USA;AUSTRALIA;TAIWAN;CHINA;CHINA,CHINA,CHINA,6,5.0,,"Deng, ZH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geol & Geophys, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP150104458]; Chiang Ching-Kuo Foundation of Taiwan [RG017-P-13]; 973 Program of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2015CB953801]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41602186]; China Postdoctoral Science FoundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2016 M591245],"This research was funded jointly by the Australian Research Council (Grant No. DP150104458), the Chiang Ching-Kuo Foundation of Taiwan (Grant No. RG017-P-13), the 973 Program of China (Grant No. 2015CB953801), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41602186), and China Postdoctoral Science Foundation Grant (Grant No. 2016 M591245).",Domesticated rice; Agriculture dispersal; Phytolith; Eastern Taiwan,10.1007/s12520-017-0471-z,Article,DOMESTICATION; AGRICULTURE; MIGRATION; CHINA; ASIA,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCES,14,10,ISI,INST GEOL AND GEOPHYS;AUSTRALIAN NATL UNIV;UNIV GUAM;AUSTRALIAN NATL UNIV;NATL MUSEUM PREHIST;CHINESE ACAD SCI;UNIV CHINESE ACAD SCI,INST GEOL AND GEOPHYS,A

These materials came from the same sources, but the ceramics were manufactured in different ways. Particularly, the people of O-laun-pi Phase III-IV also procured certain materials from either local sources or from somewhere in eastern Taiwan to make their pots.

2012.0,Archaeometry,AN ANALYSIS OF THE GEMBLUE GLAZE OF YE WANGS KOJI POTTERY,Tseng Y;Xu B,"Koji pottery is a glazed ceramic art used widely for figurines. In early Taiwan, it was employed in temple construction for decorative purposes. Ye Wang (1826-87) is the first historically documented Koji artist of Taiwan and also the most prominent Koji pottery artist, noted for his modelling and glazing skills. Unfortunately, his unique technique was lost following his death in 1887. In order to provide vital information for ongoing conservation work on Koji pottery, this study analysed the physical and chemical characteristics of Ye Wang's gem-blue glaze, to discover the glaze formula. DSC combined with the two-thirds rule revealed that the firing temperature of Ye Wang's works of art was most probably around 878-923 degrees C. EPMA revealed that the gem-blue glaze has high alkali levels, and belongs to the PbOK2OB2O3Na2OSiO2 system, deriving its unique colour from copper, iron, manganese and cobalt. This study found high potassium levels in the gem-blue glaze, which are generally a characteristic of traditional Chinese glazes. In addition, a unique discovery of boron, commonly used in famille rose, was also identified in the glaze. By comparing spectra of historical and reconstructed glazes and adjusting the proportion of chromophoric elements, this study found a glazing formula with colours close to those of Ye Wang's gem-blue glaze.","Natl Yunlin Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Cultural Heritage Conservat, Yunlin 64002, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,,"Tseng, YK (corresponding author), Natl Yunlin Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Cultural Heritage Conservat, Yunlin 64002, Taiwan.","National Science Council, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [NSC 97-2113-M-224-001]","The authors are indebted to Dr Gordon Turner-Walker for his valuable suggestions and for improving the language of this paper.

An attempt was also made to compare the flora of the F. hayatae forest and adjacent evergreen forests and/or Japanese beech (F. crenata) forests using information from previous phytosociological studies. F. hayatae forests are confined to a small part of north-eastern Taiwan. Thus, sampling sites were designed to cover all the known F. hayatae forests. A total of 23 relevés were sampled and 163 species were recorded. The number of common species between F. hayatae forests and other forest ecosystems such as lower evergreen forests and Japanese forests were compared. Adjacent evergreen, broad-leaved forests in Taiwan consist of 29 common species with F. hayatae forests, while 57 component species of F. hayatae forest were found common with the Japanese forests. A vegetation table was developed and one association (Yushanio-Fagetum hayatae Suzuki T. 1954, ex Hukusima et al. 2004), with two subassociations and four variants were identified.

According to the results, the accuracy of regional geoid undulation (city or state) can be improved through this process of surface fitting. © 2015, Universidade Federal do Parana.

Geod.,VBS RTK GPSassisted selfcalibration bundle adjustment for aerial triangulation of fixedwing uas images for updating topographic maps Autocalibração de Cameras com uso de VBS RTK para fotogriangulação de Imagens UAS para atualização de mapas topográficos,Chio S,"Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UASs) can collect high resolution and high quality images for local mapping. If the highly accurate GPS flying trajectory of a UAS is collected, it can support bundle adjustment aerial triangulation (AT) of UAS images and reduce the demands on ground control points (GCPs). This study installs a Trimble BD970 GNSS OEM on a fixed-wing UAS for capturing highly accurate GPS data by using a Virtual Base Station (VBS) RTK GPS technique for AT. Meanwhile, the GPS antenna-camera offset is resolved by stripwise linear drift parameters introduced in GPS observation equations, while performing bundle adjustment for AT. Additionally, self-calibration bundle adjustment is used in VBS RTK GPS-assisted AT to solve incomplete camera parameters calibrated by a close-range photogrammetric approach. The results show that the AT accuracy of fixed-wing UAS images collected with a 24 mm focal-length Canon EOS 5D Mark II camera at a flying height of 550 m above ground level is 0.21 m in planimetry and 0.22 m in height using two cross strips with two full GCPs at each corner of the block. The RMSE of check points from stereoscopic viewing can reach 0.27 m in planimetry and 0.24 m in height. The test results show that the accuracy of VBS RTK GPS-assisted bundle adjustment with self-calibration for the AT of fixed-wing UAS image can be used for updating local 1/5000 topographic maps in Taiwan. © 2016, Universidade Federal do Parana.

2016.0,Boreas,Lacustrine sedimentological and geochemical records for the last 170 years of climate and environmental changes in southeastern China,Selvaraj K;Lin B;Lou J;Xia W;Huang X;Chen C,"Reconstruction of modern climate and environmental changes in east Asia using inland natural climate archives can provide valuable insights on decadal-multidecadal climate and environmental patterns that are probably related to both natural and anthropogenic forcing. Here we investigated an 89-cm-long sediment core (TH1) from Tian Lake, southeastern China, for sedimentological, physical and geochemical parameters in order to understand climate and environmental changes for the latest two centuries. Cs-137-and Pb-210-based age models show that the fine sand-coarse silt-dominated core contains similar to 170 years (c. AD 1842-2011) of continuous sedimentation. Sediments with fine sands, low MS values, high water content, high TOC content and a high C:N ratio from c. AD 1842 to 1897 suggest intense hydrological conditions and strong runoff in the catchment, probably because of a humid climate. From AD 1897 to 1990, sediments with very fine sand and coarse silt, high MS values, low water content and unchanged TOC and C: N ratios indicate normal hydrological conditions and in-lake algae-derived organic matter. During this interval, the chemical weathering indicators show stronger weathering conditions compared with sediments deposited during AD 1842-1897, supporting the dominance of weathered surface soil input in the earlier interval and physical erosion dominance in the later period, respectively. Since AD 1990, the continuous decrease of geochemical proxies suggests human-interacted Earth surface processes in the catchment of Tian Lake. A PCA revealed four dominant geochemical controlling factors -detrital input, trophic status, grain size and early diagenesis -, accounting for 26, 20, 18 and 16% of total variance, respectively. This study for the first time provides lacustrine geochemical evidence for the most recent two centuries of climate and environmental changes in coastal southeastern China, a region that is currently undergoing an inversion of critical zone, i.e. an overturning of its soil profile, owing to swift modernization.","Xiamen Univ, State Key Lab Marine Environm Sci, Xiamen 361102, Peoples R China.;  Chinese Naval Acad, Dept Marine Sci, Kaohsiung 81345, Taiwan.;  Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, Key Lab Lake Sedimentat & Environm, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;  Tongji Univ, State Key Lab Marine Geol, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China.;  Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Oceanog, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan.;",CHINA;TAIWAN;CHINA;CHINA;TAIWAN,CHINA,CHINA,6,2.0,,"Selvaraj, K (corresponding author), Xiamen Univ, State Key Lab Marine Environm Sci, Xiamen 361102, Peoples R China.","National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41273083]; Xiamen University, ChinaXiamen University [2013SH012]; Tongji University, China [MGK1201]","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation of China (grant no. 41273083), Shanhai Fund of Xiamen University, China (grant no. 2013SH012) and Open Fund of Tongji University, China (grant no.

1978.0,Bull Volcanol,Petrochemistry and origin of pleistocene volcanic rocks from northern Taiwan,Chen C,"The Pleistocene volcanic rocks from northern Taiwan include the Tatun volcano group and the Chilung volcano group. Three rock types occur in this area: Tatun volcano group yield high-alumina basalt and andesites, whereas the chilung volcano group mainly consists of dacites. In addition, amphibole-rich nodules have also been found in different cruptive units of the former volcano group. Around seventy sample of various rock types have been conducted for geochemical studies, including analyses of major elements and trace elements such as Co, Cr, Cu, Li, Ni, Zn, Zr, V, Rb and Sr. Results of Al2O3, MnO, TiO2 total alkali content, MgO/ΣFeO and K2O/Na2O ratios and AMF diagram indicate that these Pleistocene volcanic rocks belong to typical calalkaline rock series. Detailed study of the trace elements reveals that these volcanic rocks are closely correlated with rocks of continental margin type with respect to Rb, Cu, Co, Ni, V and Cr contents, and K/Rb and Ni/Co ratios. These rocks are most probably derived from the fractionation of basaltic magma controlled mainly by the crystallization of amphibole and plagioclase with magnetite playing a minor role. © 1978 Intern.

We take the fold-thrust belt (i.e., the foothills and the Hsuehshan range) in NW Taiwan as a case study, which is a product of the Plio-Pleistocene arc-continent collision. A total of about 760 and 1700 faults and other fractures, respectively, were collected at 41 sites in the field. We have identified four sets of bed-perpendicular joints in the study area. The observation of joints and bedding at each site indicates that most of the penetrative joint sets developed in the earlier tectonic stage of the pre-folding/pre-tilting event, illustrating the fact that the intersection of joint sets lies along the line perpendicular to the bedding plane. We thus interpret these sets as tectonic fractures under deep-seated tectonic stress. We used the regional fold axes as reference to define the four fracture sets. However, we found that complexity in the study area makes this rather tentative. Principal stress axes sigma 1, sigma 2, sigma 3, were calculated by means of inversion of fault slip data at each site. The ratio Phi that defines the shape of stress ellipsoid is generally small, indicating that the value of the maximum principal stress axe sigma 1 is much larger compared to that of sigma 2 and sigma 3, which are approximately equal. The paleostress regime was characterized by a combination of thrust and strike-slip tectonic regimes. Based on their geometric relationships with tilted bedding, we found most of striated micro-faults were strongly related to the regional folding and can be categorized as early-, during, and late-folding stages. We characterized two major directions for the compressive event, oriented N110-120 degrees E and N150-160 degrees E respectively, which provide additional evidence to delineate the debates about paleostress changes in the Taiwan mountain building process.","MOEA, Cent Geol Survey, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei 115, Taiwan.;  UPMC, CNRS, ISTeP, UMR 7193, Paris, France.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei, Taiwan.;  CNRS, NSC, Int Lab ADEPT, F-75700 Paris, France.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;FRANCE;TAIWAN;FRANCE,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,7,1.0,1.0,"Lee, JC (corresponding author), Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei 115, Taiwan.","Central Geological Survey; Institute of Earth Sciences, Academia SinicaAcademia Sinica - Taiwan; National Science Council, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [NSC101-2116-M-001-005]","This paper is written in memory of Prof. Jacques Angelier who spent nearly 30 years advising geodynamic research in Taiwan.

In our study, we have found that the uplift rate of the northern Tainan tableland is faster than the southern tableland. The slant range displacement (SRD) rate for the area north along the precise leveling array is about 5 to 10 mm/yr with respect to the western edge of the Tainan tableland, whereas the SRD rate for the area south of the leveling array is about 1 to 5 mm/yr. In addition, the uplifted area extends eastward to the Tawan lowland with a maximum SRD rate of nearly 10 mm/yr, which is almost the same as the rate of the Tainan tableland. Results of this study differ from those suggested in previous researches that employed ERS-1/2 radar images taken from 1996 to 1999 and the differential interferometry synthetic aperture radar (D-InSAR) technique. Our findings indicated that the Tawan lowland no longer subsides with respect to the western edge of the Tainan tableland, and that both northern and southern areas are experiencing uplift.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Natl Cent Univ, Inst Geophys, Chungli, Taiwan.;  Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,6,1.0,1.0,"Hu, JC (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei, Taiwan.","National Science CouncilMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [97-2745-M-001-002-]","We greatly appreciate suggestions from two anonymous reviewers to largely improve the manuscript.

1978.0,Bull. Volcanol.,Magma types of volcanic rocks and continental margin of the Taiwan upper Paleozoic Geosyncline,Wang Y;Liu T,"Greenrocks are very common in the Tananao Schist of eastern Taiwan where the known fossils are of Permian in age. Fourty-four greenrock samples were chemically analysed and their magma types studied. The chemical composition of the greenrocks have marked variation common in volcanic rock series. The greater parts of the greenrocks belong to basalt and a smaller portion to basaltic andesite (SiO2 53 %–58 %). They are probably isochemical with their original igneous rocks except for volatile components. No striking Fe-enrichment exists in a MgO-ΣFeO-(Na2O=K2O) diagram. Based on (Na2O=K2O)-Al2O3-SiO2 diagrams after Kuno (1960), the parent magma of the rocks mostly belong to the high-alumina basalt series and only a few to alkali olivine basalt series. The high-alumina basalt can be looked upon as having an incipient trend for the calc-alkaline or the hypersthene series of Kuno (1959). The average K/Rb ratio of 460, the average TiO2 percentage of 1.5 %, and low K2O of around 0.5 % seem to warrant a conclusion that the basaltic rocks were poured out in the upper Paleozoic eugeosyncline on an embryonic continental crust. Considering the rock association of amphibolite plus serpentine (dismembered ophiolite), meta-graywacke, metachert, crystalline limestone, metaarkose, and metabasites in the Tananao Schist, the most probable site for the eugeosyncline may been an extensional trough near the fragmented paleo-Asiatic margin. © 1978, Intern.

1999.0,Bull. Volcanol.,Evidence for volatileinfluenced differentiation in a layered alkali basalt flow Penghu Islands Taiwan,Greenough J;Lee C;Fryer B,"An approximately 20-m-thick alkali basalt flow on the Penghu Islands contains similar to 20 cm thick, horizontally continuous (>50 m), vesicular layers separated by similar to 1.5 m of massive basalt in its upper 8.5 m. The three layers contain ocelli-like ""vesicles"" filled with nepheline and igneous carbonate. They are coarse grained and enriched in incompatible elements relative to the massive basalt with which they form sharp contacts. These vesicular layers (segregation veins) formed when residual liquid in the underlying crystal mush was forced (gas filter pressing) or siphoned into three thermally induced horizontal cracks that opened successively in the advancing crystal mush of the flow's upper crust. Most vesicular layer trace elements can be modelled by residual melt extraction after 25-40% fractional crystallization of massive basalt underlying each layer. Sulphur, Cl, As, Zn, Pb, K, Na, Rb, and Sr show large concentration changes between the top, middle, and bottom layers, with each vesicular and underlying massive basalt forming a chemically distinct ""pair."" The large changes between layers are difficult to account for by crystal fractionation alone, because other incompatible elements (e.g., La, Sm, Yb, Zr, Nb) and the major elements change little. The association of these elements (S, Cl, etc.) with ""fluids"" in various geologic environments suggests that volatiles influenced differentiation, perhaps by moving alkali. alkaline earth, and chalcophile elements as magma-dissolved volatile complexes. Volatiles may have also led to large grain sizes in the segregation veins by lowering melt viscosities and raising diffusion rates. The chemical variability between layers indicates that a convection and concentration mechanism acted within the flow. The specific process cannot be determined, but different rates of vesicle plume rise (through the flow) and/or accumulation in the upper crust's crystal mush might account for the chemical pairing and extreme variations in Cl. S, As, and C. This study emphasizes the importance of sampling vesicular rocks in flows.

The network of 48 stations revealed the velocity field in the Pingtung Plain. Horizontal velocities range from 31 to 54 mm yr-1 towards azimuths 247° to 273°. They show clear anti-clockwise deviation in the coastal area, consistent with tectonic transtension related to lateral escape at the transition collision-subduction. The deformation resembles a particle flow towards a free boundary, and is not a rigid rotation. Vertical velocities range from +13 to - 25 mm yr-1. Twenty stations show fast subsidence in the coastal area, with rates averaging - 16 mm/yr. The comparison with Holocene subsidence suggests that about 75% of the present-day subsidence result from decreasing groundwater level induced by over-pumping, adding significant short-term component to the natural risk resulting from long-term tectonic subsidence. © 2005 Published by Elsevier SAS on behalf of Académie des sciences.","Central Geological Survey, MOEA, P.O.

The Hengchun Peninsula of Taiwan is the southern extremity of the Central Range of Taiwan and thus an emergent part of the accretionary wedge resulting from subduction of Eurasia beneath the Philippine Sea plate at the Manila Trench. Radiocarbon dating of fossil shorelines on the peninsula shows that it has been uplifted at an average rate of 3.8 mm/yr during the Holocene. About 1/3 of the uplift is due to deformation along the Hengchun reverse fault but, in contrast with the Chelungpu and other low angle reverse faults west of the Central Range, it accommodates strain principally by aseismic creep.","Nat Hist Museum, Dept Mineral, London SW7 5BD, England.; Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geog, Taipei 106, Taiwan.;",UNITED KINGDOM;TAIWAN,UNITED KINGDOM,UNITED KINGDOM,2,2.0,1.0,"Vita-Finzi, C (corresponding author), Nat Hist Museum, Dept Mineral, Cromwell Rd, London SW7 5BD, England.",,,Taiwan; seismicity; neotectonics; C-14 dating; geodesy,10.1016/j.crte.2005.04.014,Article,SW TAIWAN; DEFORMATION; FIELD,ELSEVIER FRANCE-EDITIONS SCIENTIFIQUES MEDICALES ELSEVIER,COMPTES RENDUS GEOSCIENCE,5,337,ISI,NATL TAIWAN UNIV,C (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR),B2

2013.0,Carbonates Evaporites,The atomic HC ratio of kerogen and its relation to organic geochemical parameters implications for evaluating hydrocarbon generation of source rock,Lee H;Sun L,"In this study, kerogen samples, including 19 from northwestern Taiwan, 15 from China, and 16 from Australia were analyzed, and integrated with 49 published data, to explore the significance of atomic H/C ratio as a parameter of source rock evaluation. Organic matters in the samples studied are of type II/III kerogen based on the relationship between HI and T (max). The H/C ratio, as well as the HI, S1, and S2, generally decreases with the maturity increasing. The H/C ratio decreases slightly from 1.1 to 0.7 with the maturity increasing from Ro 0.55 to 0.85 %. Samples with H/C ratio in this range show significant change in certain other geochemical parameters (e.g., HI, S1, S2, S1 + S2, S1/(S1 + S2), S1/TOC, (S1 + S2)/TOC, T (max)). The atomic H/C value is in the range of 0.7-1.1, the value of the corresponding HI shows a stable increasing trend. This shows that organic matters in an oil window of Ro% = 0.55 and atomic H/C = 1.1 have reached a certain maturity and hydrocarbon potential. The QI, HI and H/C ratio shows a certain correlation, all increasing accordingly. It is inferred that hydrocarbon potential started from Ro 0.55 % and atomic H/C ratio 1.1 in this study.","Nan Kai Univ Technol, Dept Elect & Informat Technol, Nan Kai, Nan Tou County, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,1.0,"Lee, HT (corresponding author), Nan Kai Univ Technol, Dept Elect & Informat Technol, Nan Kai, Nan Tou County, Taiwan.","National Science CouncilMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [NSC-99-2116-M-252-001, NSC-101-2116-M-252-001]","We wish to thank anonymous reviewers of this manuscript for giving constructive suggestions and revision comments.

2010.0,Cartogr. J.,Geographic reality versus imagination in Taiwans historical maps,Lay J;Chen Y;Yap K,"During the past 400 years, Taiwan has experienced the dominance of various political regimes, which allowed the development of a diversity of cartographic styles for academic comparison. A detailed analysis of historical maps across centuries demonstrates that this contested island has been illustrated with a blending of reality, misconception and imagination. This paper narrates how maps reveal political rulers’ conscious and unconscious perceptions of this island. We call attention to the abundant cartographic materials in existence and suggest that they can be fascinating materials for the study of the contested colonial histories of this island in various disciplines. © The British Cartographic Society 2010.","Department of Geography, National Taiwan University, Taiwan; Department of Politics and Management, University of Konstanz, Germany",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;GERMANY,TAIWAN,,3,1.0,,,,NA NA NA,Historical maps;  Taiwan,10.1179/000870410X12658023467402,Article,,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,Cartographic Journal,6,47,scopus,,,A
2002.0,Catena,Frequency and spatial distribution of landslides in a mountainous drainage basin Western Foothills Taiwan,Chang J;Slaymaker O,"Maps from 1904 and 1915 and air photographs from 1963, 1980, 1985, 1993 and 1996 provide a record of landslide incidence in a 92.1-km(2) drainage basin, a headwater tributary of the Cho-Shui River in Taiwan. Interpretation of landslide patterns from the early maps indicate that in four sub-basins (36 km(2)) structural geological factors control chronic landsliding regularly reactivated by intense rains. Within these four sub-basins, all later air photographs reveal a continuing high incidence of landslides (with landslide densities of 3 - 11 ha/km(2)). Air photographs taken in 1963, following extensive logging, in 1985, following highway construction, and in 1996, following the very large typhoon Herb event demonstrate the short-term effects of disturbance in these structurally weak sub-basins. Air photographs from 1980 and 1993 demonstrate recovery of the land surface from logging and highway construction impacts, respectively. For the adjacent sub-basins (56 km 2), two modes of response to perturbations were identified: six sub-basins (48 km(2)) showed direct response to logging, road construction and typhoon Herb and five sub-basins (8 km(2)) were more buffered and showed some lagged responses. Even this last category of sub-basins is more active than the average for Taiwan, where the mean landslide density is 0.84 ha/ km(2). It is proposed that, for the 92.1-km(2) Hoshe basin, the 'formative event' sensu Brunsden [Z. Geomorphol. Suppl. 79 (1990) 1] is one that produces approximately 200 ha of landslides, a value that has been equaled or exceeded in each of the periods of study (1963-1980, 1980-1985, 1985 - 1993 and 1993 - 1996). Logging activity, major road construction, and extreme typhoon and earthquake events produce short-term acceleration of landslide incidence. In principle, recovery rates of the land from pulsed perturbations of about 20 years for logging activity and about 8 years for major road construction may also be suggested.

2007.0,Catena,Soil genesis along a chronosequence on marine terraces in eastern Taiwan,Tsai C;Tsai H;Hseu Z;Chen Z,"Soil chronosequences developed on elevated marine terraces are ideal for studying changes in soil-forming processes with time. The coastal range of eastern Taiwan is a product of active arc-continent collision. Vertisols, Mollisols and Entisols are generally found on the different levels of marine terraces herein, but no detailed investigations of soil chronosequence have been conducted by integrating field morphology, physio-chemical characterization, micromorphology and mass-balance interpretations. Five soil pedons were selected on the three marine terraces including Tt-1 and Tt-2 pedons (Typic Hapluderts) on the first higher level with the oldest soil age (9-10 ka), Tt-3 (Vertic Hapludolls) and Tt-4 pedons (Typic Hapludolls) on the second intermediate level (5-6 ka), and Tt-5 pedon (Typic Udipsamments) on the third lower level with the youngest soil age (<= 3.5 ka). The morphological characteristics showed that strongly developed angular blocky structures, pressure faces and slickensides are more common in higher terrace soils than in lower terrace soils. In this study, depth to C horizon, solum thickness, and thickness of the clay-enriched zone increase with relative terrace age. Although only one to two profiles per terrace were characterized, the following soil analytical characterizations increase with time: the degree of sand grains weathering, pH (H2O), organic carbon, CEC, contents of Fed, Fe-o and Mad. Based on X-ray diffraction analysis of the clay-size fraction, soils on all terraces have a mixed mineralogy. Mica, smectite, and kaolinite have slightly increased with increasing terrace age. Furthermore, the dominant processes identified with mass-balance analysis include loss of bases (Ca and Mg), iron, and clay with time. The soil properties, including analytical and mineralogical characterizations, which do not have notable changes with time are primarily due to relatively young soil age (< 10 ka).

2012.0,Catena,Assessing soil erosion in a terraced paddy field using experimental measurements and universal soil loss equation,Chen S;Liu C;Chen Y,"The study assesses the effects of event rainfall on the soil erosion in terraced paddy fields under rice cropping, fallow, and green manure planting. A 0.75-ha terraced rice field was used to investigate the soil erosion under the regular cultivation of rice in 2005, fallow in 2006, and planting with green manure in 2007. The results show that infiltration rates significantly increase when a terraced paddy field is under fallow or is planted with green manure; the paddy is more vulnerable to embankment collapse and increased the rates of soil erosion. In an experimental field, suspended solid in run-off samples reached the maximal concentrations of 1700 mg/l for fallow in 2006, and 3400 mg/l for manure planted field in 2007, during heavy rainfall events. These values were significantly greater than the erosion rate of 500 mg/l recorded for rice cropped field during 2005. The estimated annual erosion rate was 4.15 ton ha(-1) yr(-1) for green manure planted field, which was significantly higher than that of the rice-planted terraced paddy (0.77 ton ha(-1) yr(-1)). Moreover, terraced paddy runoff significantly increased when planted with green manure. Soil erosion rates calculated by the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) from the optimal available data were considerably higher than the field-measured values. The comparison revealed that soil conservation using rice-planted terraced paddy was more effective than that resulting from other uses. The government should formulate effective measures and maintain sustainable rice planting in the terraced paddies. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

2013.0,Catena,Applying indicatorbased geostatistical approaches to determine potential zones of groundwater recharge based on borehole data,Jang C;Chen S;Kuo Y,"Evaluating a potential zone of groundwater recharge is considerably critical for planning a scheme of quality protection and quantity management of groundwater. This study determined potential zones of groundwater recharge using indicator kriging (IK) based on borehole data in the Pingtung Plain, southern Taiwan. Data on subsoil textures were first dassified into four categories - gravel (very rapid subsoil infiltration), coarse sand to medium sand (rapid subsoil infiltration), fine sand to very fine sand (slow subsoil infiltration), and silt, mud, and clay (very slow subsoil infiltration). IK was used to characterize the classifications of subsoil infiltration by selecting a maximum estimation probability. Then, contents of fast soil permeability in unsaturated aquifers (gravel to medium sand), which represent the capacity of unsaturated aquifer percolation, were estimated spatially and probabilistically using IK Finally, combinations under different conditions of subsoil infiltration and unsaturated aquifer percolation were recommended to delineate potential zones of groundwater recharge. Owing to limited observed data, estimated probabilities of subsoil infiltration and unsaturated aquifer percolation obtained from IK can explore the uncertainty of estimated parameters. The analyzed results reveal that IK has good functionality for determining potential zones of groundwater recharge. The northeastern and southeastern regions are main groundwater recharge zones, approximately 19.6% of total area. Artificial ponds or wetlands can be established in the determined zones to enhance groundwater recharge. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

2013.0,Catena,High rates of erosion and rapid weathering in a PlioPleistocene mudstone badland Taiwan,Higuchi K;Chigira M;Lee D,"The badlands of southwest Taiwan are characterized by sharp ridges, and are located in a tropical monsoon area that experiences contrasting rainy and dry seasons. Surface erosion predominates and subsurface erosion by piping is rather limited to accumulation of mud in valley bottoms. Erosion rates on Plio-Pleistocene mudstone slopes, measured using erosion pins over a period of 4 years, averaged up to 9 cm/y, which is considerably faster than the rates of a few cm/y typical in arid or semi-arid areas. Mudstone sample cores recovered from the slopes in the dry season (April), and in the early rainy season (July), prior to the extensive erosion that occurs later in the rainy season, suggested the following mechanism for weathering and erosion. Near-surface layers (<10 cm deep) on these slopes develop lower bulk densities, larger void ratios, and higher salt contents during the early rainy season, and this degraded near-surface layer is rapidly removed by slaking and erosion during the intense precipitation of the main rainy season. This slaking may be caused by the electric repulsion and dispersion of grains. Following the period of erosion, the newly exposed rock dries during the subsequent dry season, and the near-surface layer then follows the same cycle of development and rapid removal during the next dry and early rainy seasons.

2016.0,Catena,Forms and distribution of phosphorus in a placic podzolic toposequence in a subtropical subalpine forest Taiwan,Jien S;Baillie I;Hu C;Chen T;Iizuka Y;Chiu C,"Phosphorous (P) is a limiting nutrient in subtropical and tropical mountain forests, where placic podzolization further restricts mobilization and the transformation of P fractionation. We examined how the distribution of different forms of phosphorus varied with increasing placic podzolization along a toposequence of seven pedons in subalpine forest soils in Taiwan. We used a variation of the Hedley procedure for the chemical sequential extraction of P and electron-probe micro-analysis (EPMA) to determine the micro-distribution and associations of P with other elements in selected illuvial horizons. The fractionation and P:Ti ratios indicated that P is not greatly depleted during the development of placic conditions. It is instead increasingly sequestered in sesquioxides and their organic complexes in the illuvial B horizons and in the accreting peaty surface layers. The EPMA micro-mapping in the Bsm horizons revealed that P was mainly associated with illuviated iron but not with aluminum. Forests on these soils must cope with a combination of an apparently adequate P supply and an increasingly stagnic moisture regime. When placic conditions develop in the soil, P appears to be increasingly sequestered in the sesquioxides and their complexes with illuvial humus in the B horizons and in the accreting organic epipedon.

2016.0,Catena,Soil evolution in a tropical climate An example from a chronosequence on marine terraces in Taiwan,Huang W;Jien S;Tsai H;Hseu Z;Huang S,"Because of frequent tectonic activities due to arc-continent collision, multi-level marine terraces are present along the coast of the Taiwan Island. They are suitable sites for constructing tropical soil chronosequences. This study investigated soils along a transect on reef terraces on the Kenting Peninsula, the southmost tip of Taiwan, in order to construct a soil chronosequence and then reveal the relation between the soils and geomorphic processes. Parent materials of the soils appear to be mainly alluvial deposits or eolian beach sands covering the reef. Selected pedogenic properties of the soils, clay, free iron oxides and crystallinity ratio of free iron oxides, silicon-aluminum and silicon-aluminum-iron ratio, silicon-aluminum and silicon-aluminum-iron ratio, increased or decreased or decreased rapidly at first and slowly with time, following a single logarithmic relationship with soil age. Moreover, the structureless soils on the youngest terrace were classified as Entisols, whereas the soils with subangular blocky and clay coatings on the high (old) terraces were classified as Alfisols or Ultisols. A post-incisive chronosequence was identified for these soils. Finally, a schematic model is proposed to explain the relationships between pedological morphologies of the soils and terrace-surface processes.

2018.0,Catena,Soil aggregate breakdown and carbon release along a chronosequence of recovering landslide scars in a subtropical watershed,Schomakers J;Mayer H;Lee J;Lee T;Jien S;Mentler A;Hein T;Huang J;Hseu Z;Cheng L;Yu C;Zehetner F,"Typhoons episodically trigger landslides and export large quantities of particulate and dissolved organic carbon (POC and DOC) to the ocean from high-standing islands of the western North Pacific. On landslide scars, new soils are forming and organic carbon (OC) re-accumulates; however, these young soils may remain vulnerable to recurrent erosion. Here, we examined soil aggregate breakdown and concomitant release of OC from soils on recovering landslide scars in Taiwan. We calculated the kinetic energies of falling raindrops during two past typhoon events that hit Taiwan, i.e. Morakot (2009) and Fanapi (2010), at 137 kJ m(-2) and 21 kJ m(-2), respectively. Soils from a chronosequence of recovering landslide scars (6 to 41 yrs) in the Central Mountain Range of Taiwan were subjected to ultrasonic vibrations simulating those typhoon energies. The younger soils of the chronosequence (< 12 yrs) displayed little aggregate stability. Our results show that it may take several decades before soil aggregate stability significantly improves to withstand energy inputs corresponding to more frequent, moderate typhoons such as Fanapi; however, even the soils from an undisturbed reference site showed almost complete aggregate breakdown when subjected to the simulated energy of a rare but severe typhoon such as Morakot. With increasing recovery age and vegetation change towards forest cover, OC was increasingly accumulated in the soil aggregates and efficiently protected against disruption by lower simulated typhoon energy; however, upon increased aggregate breakdown induced by high simulated typhoon energy, significantly more DOC and POC was released. In light of increasing frequency of typhoon events with global climate change, active reforestation can stabilize soil structure and thus enhance protection against recurrent erosion of the newly forming soils.","Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Soil Res, Dept Forest & Soil Sci, Vienna, Austria.;  Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Phys & Mat Sci, Dept Mat Sci & Proc Engn, Vienna, Austria.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geog, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Geog, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Natl Pingtung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Soil & Water Conservat, Neipu, Taiwan.;  Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Dept Water Atmosphere Environm, Inst Hydrobiol & Aquat Ecosyst Management, Vienna, Austria.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Agr Chem, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.;  WasserCluster Lunz, Lunz Am See, Austria.;",AUSTRIA;AUSTRIA;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;AUSTRIA;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;AUSTRIA,AUSTRIA,AUSTRIA,12,3.0,1.0,"Zehetner, F (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Soil Res, Dept Forest & Soil Sci, Vienna, Austria.","Austrian Science FundAustrian Science Fund (FWF) [FWF I 1396-B16]; Ministry of Science and Technology, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 102-2923-M-002-001-MY3]","We are grateful for funding from the Austrian Science Fund (FWF I 1396-B16) and Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan (MOST 102-2923-M-002-001-MY3).

For our study area, we selected two adjacent catchments in northern Taiwan: the Shihmen Reservoir catchment, an area with high-relief topography that is susceptible to landslides at present, and the Xindian River catchment, an area with gentle topography that is not prone to landslides at present. This study established empirical relationships between landslide-area characteristics and rainfall conditions according to rainfall-induced landslides during past typhoon events. The relationships were applied to estimate landslide-area characteristics caused by typhoon events for the base period (1979-2003) and the end of the 21st century (2075-2099) according to the climate change scenario of representative concentration pathways 8.5 (RCP8.5) and dynamical downscaling of rainfall data in Taiwan. We also analyzed rainfall amounts at different recurrence intervals from different rainfall durations for the two catchments. We found that the area with high-relief topography (the Shihmen Reservoir catchment) is relatively prone to landslides currently and that the cumulative rainfall is a key factor controlling landslide-area characteristics. On the other hand, the area with gentle topography (the Xindian River catchment) is less prone to landslides at present, and the rainfall intensity is a key factor controlling landslide-area characteristics. Under the effects of climate change in the near future, both landslide severity and landslide frequency will increase more in areas with gentle topography than in areas with high-relief topography, in response to the more frequent occurrence of a strong typhoon with higher rainfall intensity.","Natl Sci & Technol Ctr Disaster Reduct, 200,Sec 3,Beixin Rd, New Taipei, Taiwan.;  Univ Tokyo, Ctr Spatial Informat Sci, 5-1-5 Kashiwanoha, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778568, Japan.;",TAIWAN;JAPAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,7,1.0,1.0,"Chen, CW (corresponding author), Natl Sci & Technol Ctr Disaster Reduct, 200,Sec 3,Beixin Rd, New Taipei, Taiwan.",Taiwan Climate Change Projection and Information Platform (TCCIP) [MOST106-2621-M-865-001],"We would like to thank the theme C of the Program for Risk Information on Climate Change of Japan (SOUSEI-C) for providing the MRI-AGCM data.

2019.0,Catena,Characterization of landslide distribution and sediment yield in the TsengWen River Watershed Taiwan,Yang S;Jan C;Yen H;Wang J,"Sediment yield is one of the primary variables of the global denudation system and is often adopted as a measure of terrestrial erosion rates in watersheds. In general watersheds, sediment supply and transport are two of the major mechanisms that may alternate sediment yield. The ordinary approach to conduct sediment prediction is to assume that erosion rates and average annual sediment yields are affected by mean annual precipitation. However, this assumption cannot fully reflect the behavior of sediment yield in regions with relatively high temporal variability. In this study, the TsengWen River Watershed (TWRW) was investigated to characterize the landslide distribution and the associated sediment yield. The results show that lithology can influence the frequency-area distribution of landslides and hence can control the volumetric sediment on hillslopes that contributes to fluvial systems. Short-term sediment yield in downstream reaches of channels correlated with the rainfall erosivity and the water discharge during rainstorms. The amount of supplied sediment and storm runoff on hillslopes as well as the transport capacity of river channels could create limitations in watershed systems. The large amount of sediment transported by rivers is attributed to the additional supply of sediment materials from upland sources such as hillslopes. Subsequent storm events could change the relationships of the sediment supply with respect to water discharge. Hence, large rainfall events are crucial for controlling sediment production, storm runoff on hillslopes, and the transport capacity of river channels in medium watersheds. In addition, anthropogenic forces may also create corresponding impact on the relationships of sediment yield, supply, and transport processes.","Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Hydraul & Ocean Engn, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.;  Texas A&M Univ, Blackland Res & Extens Ctr, Temple, TX 76502 USA.;  Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Ecol Soil & Water Conservat Res Ctr, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;USA;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,4,1.0,1.0,"Yang, SY (corresponding author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Hydraul & Ocean Engn, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and Technology in TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 104-2221-E-006-053-MY3]; United States Department of Agriculture-Natural Resources Conservation Service (USDA-NRCS) Conservation Effects Assessment Project (CEAP)-Wildlife and Cropland components",This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan (Grant No. MOST 104-2221-E-006-053-MY3) and the United States Department of Agriculture-Natural Resources Conservation Service (USDA-NRCS) Conservation Effects Assessment Project (CEAP)-Wildlife and Cropland components.,Landslides; Lithology; Rainfall erosivity factor; Sediment yield; Topography; Typhoon,10.1016/j.catena.2018.11.011,Article,RAINFALL EROSIVITY; MOUNTAIN BELT; EROSION; TRANSPORT; LANDSCAPE; BASIN; PRECIPITATION; VARIABILITY; EARTHQUAKE; MANAGEMENT,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,CATENA,3,174,ISI,NATL CHENG KUNG UNIV;TEXAS AANDM UNIV;NATL CHENG KUNG UNIV,NATL CHENG KUNG UNIV,B2
2019.0,Catena,Using multinomial logistic regression for prediction of soil depth in an area of complex topography in Taiwan,Chan H;Chang C;Chen P;Lee J,"Increasing land developments, unreasonable utilization of land, earthquakes, typhoons, and torrential rain often cause hillside disasters. Soil depth is a crucial parameter influencing the scale of shallow landslides and sustainable land use in hillside areas. This paper presents a statistical model, integrated with environmental factors, for estimating soil depth in a catchment area with complex topography. The study area selected was upstream of the Houlong River in Taiwan. The model was developed using multinomial logistic regression and environmental factors such as hill slope, hill aspect, elevation, topographical curvature, and the normalized difference vegetation index. The results were then compared with those obtained from previous models applying Ordinary Kriging, Regression Kriging, and topographical wetness index methods. A classification error matrix and the Kappa index were then employed to assess the various models. The results showed that, for the data set used for model establishment, the overall accuracy and Kappa index were 76.6% and 0.65, respectively, whereas for the data set used for verification, they were 70.5% and 0.57, respectively. By contrast, the Ordinary Kriging method yielded an overall accuracy and a Kappa index of 45.7% and 0.15, respectively; the Regression Kriging method yielded results of 46.7% and 0.16, respectively; and the topographical wetness index method yielded results of 30.5% and -0.05, respectively. The proposed model was therefore determined to be superior to the others in terms of soil depth estimation accuracy. The proposed model can predict soil depth on a regional scale and serve as a reliable tool that provides reference data for future research on land use and shallow landslides.","Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Soil & Water Conservat, Taichung, Taiwan.;  Council Agr, Execut Yuan, Taichung Branch, Soil & Water Conservat Bur, Taichung, Taiwan.;  Natl Chiayi Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, Chiayi, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,4,1.0,0.0,"Chan, HC (corresponding author), Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Soil & Water Conservat, Taichung, Taiwan.",,,Soil depth; Prediction map; Statistical model; Environmental factors,10.1016/j.catena.2019.01.030,Article,MODEL; AGREEMENT; LANDSCAPE,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,CATENA,12,176,ISI,NATL CHUNG HSING UNIV;COUNCIL AGR;NATL CHIAYI UNIV,NATL CHUNG HSING UNIV,B2
2020.0,Catena,Porewater chemistry and its influence on rock mechanical properties and hydrogeophysical processes in a mudstone slope in the southwestern Taiwan badlands,Higuchi K;Chigira M;Lee D;Wu J,"Bedrock characteristics and its influence on hydrogeophysical processes in a Plio-Pleistocene mudstone slope were examined in southwestern Taiwan. Previous works carried out in this area indicated seasonal patterns of the bedrock physical properties and deterioration of the mechanical strength during weathering to generate extremely high rates of erosion during heavy rainfall, thereby forming badland topography. This area has a humid subtropical climate that is characterised by distinct dry and rainy seasons. During the rainy season, high rates of erosion of the weathered mudstone occur during rainfall events. To investigate impact of characteristics of bedrock physical properties on hillslope weathering and erosion processes in this area, we analysed the pore-water chemistry, specific surface area, and swelling of the mudstone of the studied slope and performed in situ monitoring of water content and pore-water electrical conductivity at 2.5-40 cm depths near the slope surface. The results indicate that the mudstone contains saline pore water, is categorized as dispersive, and has a dense fabric, thereby favouring the occurrence of rock mechanical breakdown due to chemical osmosis. The influence of rock mechanical properties and bedrock behaviour on the hydrogeophysical processes near the slope surface varies with the season. During the dry season, the water content of the mudstone near the slope surface decreases, causing desiccation cracks to form and concentrating salt on rock surfaces. Water contents at 40 cm depths increased within 1 h after rainfalls during the monitoring intervals of the dry season, suggesting that surface water infiltrates rapidly by gravity into networks of cracks during infrequent rain events. During the following rainy season, intense rainfall events moisten the slope surface layer and increase the volume of the mudstone by swelling caused by chemical osmosis. The swelling is associated with an enlargement of the pore size of the mudstone during the dilution of saline water by fresh rainwater, with the greatest amount of swelling occurring at or near the surface where salt is most concentrated. Water contents at 40 cm depths scarcely responded to rainfalls during the monitoring intervals of the rainy season, suggested that this swelling closes desiccation cracks and prevents surface water from migrating downwards into the slope. The resulting seasonal erosion occurs by slope surface wash caused by intense rain during the late rainy season. The newly exposed mudstone on the slope starts to become desiccated during the subsequent dry season, and a new cycle of weathering commences.","Univ Tokyo 5 1 5, Ctr Spatial Informat Sci, 5-1-5 Kashiwanoha, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778568, Japan.;  Kyoto Univ Gokasho, Disaster Prevent Res Inst, Uji, Kyoto 6110011, Japan.;  Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Civil Engn, 1 Univ Rd, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.;",JAPAN;JAPAN;TAIWAN,JAPAN,JAPAN,4,3.0,0.0,"Higuchi, K (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo 5 1 5, Ctr Spatial Informat Sci, 5-1-5 Kashiwanoha, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778568, Japan.",,,Mudstone; Badlands; Weathering; Erosion; Monitoring,10.1016/j.catena.2020.104533,Article,EROSION PROCESSES; SOUTHERN; BASILICATA; RATES; SHALE,ELSEVIER,CATENA,4,190,ISI,KASHIWA;KYOTO UNIV GOKASHO;NATL CHENG KUNG UNIV,,B2
2020.0,Catena,Temporal variation of chemical weathering rate source shifting and relationship with physical erosion in small mountainous rivers Taiwan,Lee Y;Chen P;Lee T;Shih Y;Huang J,"Temporal variation of the chemical weathering rate (CWR) versus physical erosion rate (PER) and the shift of the sources of dissolved solids during rainstorms are explored in two small mountainous rivers, Northern Taiwan. The ionic hydrochemistry of streamwater, rainwater, soil water, and groundwater were collected to quantitatively demonstrate the sources of the dissolved solids and the coupling effect between CWR and PER during typhoon and non-typhoon periods. Results indicate that silicate cation weathering (CWRSC) varies between 33 and 37 t km(-2) yr(-1), which is similar to 7 times the global mean, and the annual PER is similar to 81-166 t km(-2) yr(-1), similar to the global mean of similar to 137 t km(-2) yr(-1). The rainstorm periods only account for 1% of a year but are responsible for 10% of the CWRSC and over 80% of the sediment flux, highlighting the importance of storm events. Silicate cation concentrations present a simple dilution process during rainstorms indicates the high connectivity between hillslopes and streams during rainstorms is established and forces the soil water into streams rapidly. Besides, the coupling between CWRSC and PER becomes less relevant during rainstorms. The coupling between CWRSC and PER is non-linear with flow regime dynamics, and the estimates of CWRSC derived from non-typhoon day are as largely biased as one order of magnitude. High-resolution water chemistry data on the variations in ion production and physical erosion is more valuable than previously thought for characterizing the CWR and PER of active mountain belts.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geog, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Geog, Taipei, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,5,1.0,1.0,"Huang, JC (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geog, Taipei, Taiwan.","Taiwan Ministry of Science and Technology [MOST 107-2621-B-002-003-MY3, MOST 106-2116-M-002-020]; Austrian Science FundAustrian Science Fund (FWF) [FWF I 1396-B16]; NTU Research Center for Future Earth [107L901004]","This study was sponsored by Taiwan Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST 107-2621-B-002-003-MY3, MOST 106-2116-M-002-020), Austrian Science Fund (FWF I 1396-B16), and NTU Research Center for Future Earth (107L901004).

1992.0,Chem. Ecol.,Relationships between copper species and forms hydrographic and biomass parameters in the taiwan erhjin chi coastal area,Hung T;Tsai C,"The first incident of green oysters (Crassostrea gigas) was reported in Taiwan in the Charting coastal area in January, 1986 and mortality was reported three months later. The cause of the greened oysters was identified as copper pollution. The copper content of the green oysters was extremely high - 2100 ppm, 2225 ppm, and 4400 ppm dry weight, in January, 1986, February 1987, and January 1989, respectively. In this paper we summarize the seasonal and regional distributions of copper species (complexed by inorganic and organic ligands, labile and non-labile, polar and non-polar) and forms (dissolved and particulate) and the hydrographic and biomass parameters (mainly particulate organic carbon, chloropyll -a, adenosine triphosphate and primary production) in sea water in the Erhjin Chi coastal area. In general, high concentrations of particulate material (0.24 to 724 ppb) and non-labile organic copper (0.03 to 21.5 ppb) were observed. Low values of polar organic copper (<0.02 to 16.5 ppb) indicated that nonpolar organic complexes (0.3 to 20.4 ppb) from man-made organic pollutants were the major complexes in the area studied. On the basis of this data, the cause of greening and mortality in oysters is evaluated in relation to the bioavailable copper (sum of particulate and labile copper) and copper assimilative capacity (detoxicant). Finally, the correlations between the species and forms of copper, hydrographic and biomass parameters are also discussed. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

1992.0,Chem. Ecol.,The thermal discharges from nuclear power plants in Taiwan,Fan K,"The increasing use of sea water for industrial cooling presents a real threat to the ecological environment in the ocean. In Taiwan where many electric power plants along the coast take sea water for cooling, people are concerned seriously about nuclear power plants. There are three nuclear power plants in Taiwan. Each plant has two units for generating power. The first two are located along the northern coast of Taiwan. The third is located in Kenting National Park along the coast of southernmost Taiwan. The plants take sea water for cooling, and discharge their heated effluents to the ocean surface from the coast. The thermal effluents have variable effects on the ecological environment near the plants. Fishermen living near the power plants complain that the heated water affects the inshore fishery catch. In addition, the thermal water from the second plant is easily accumulated near the coastal zone to influence the nearby swimming area in the summer-time. The thermal water from the third plant bleaches or kills some corals in shallow water near the outlet, and this conflicts with the interests of Kenting National Park. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Ecol.,A marine pollution study of northeast coastal water off Taiwan Island,Chu K;Pan T;Tseng R;Chen L,"The coastal water of northeast Taiwan island, called ‘Yin-Yang Hai’ for its distinct yellow colour compared with blue offshore water, was investigated from 1989 to 1990 by the authors. Biological study showed the dominant species of plankton to be Copepoda. Cladocera„ planktonic eggs and Diatoma. Dominant species of benthos were young crabs. Amphipoda and Annelida, with Amphipoda usually occurring in heavily polluted areas. Heavy metal data showed that the concentration of copper was high. The copper and iron concentration in algae of the intertidal zone was also high. The concentrations of iron and copper in inshore water were also higher than in offshore water. By comparison of the pH and salinity distribution of this area, we conclude that this coastal water has been polluted by acid waste water from coastal industry. The suspended solids concentration in sea water is high. Flocculation occurring at the boundary of fresh and saline water might be a reason for the distinct yellow colour of the water of this area.

Through simple or more exhaustive extractions, the results showed that 99% of the samples containing 2,4,6-TCP and PCP could be removed by simple extraction. The concentrations were found to range from non-detectable to 16.60 ngg ‘ for 2,4,6-TCP and to 25.02 ngg 1 for PCP. Partition coefficients (Kp) were 0.71, 0.74 mig 1 for 2,4,6-TCP, 1.35 and 1.41 mlg 1 for PCP. Biodegradation by DCP-adapted or unadapted anaerobes in sediment was carried out. During 21 days’ incubation, the complete degradation time for 2,4,6-TCP in DCP-adapted anaerobic, unadapted anaerobic, and unadapted aerobic conditions were found to be 9, 10, 12 days for N3 sediment, and 8, 10, 11 days for N6 sediment, respectively; for PCP it was 19 days, without degradation, 14 days for N3 sediment, and 13, 17, 10 days for N6 sediment, respectively.

1995.0,Chem. Ecol.,Experiences of Coal Ash Artificial Reefs in Taiwan,Shu-Te K;Tsan-Chuan H;Kwang-Tsao S,"A feasibility study for using fly-ash from Taiwan coal-fired power stations for artificial reef production was started in 1983, Various mixtures of fly ash stabilized with lime, cement, or industrial wastes and formed into blocks were tested in the laboratory. The results showed that the development of compressive strength of those blocks immersed in the sea water was much better than those exposed in the air. Heavy metal (Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn) content of the blocks has been monitored routinely to determine the leaching rates. The result indicates that solidification of fly-ash could indeed immobilize heavy metals better than the original fly ash. From March 1984 to February 1987, 3,682 coal ash stabilized blocks with total weight of 300 tons were designed, fabricated and installed at both Hsin-ta, south western coast, and Kuei-hou, northern coast of Taiwan, for field trials. After four years' underwater observations on 100 cubic blocks at Wan-Li, northern Taiwan, it was shown that the physical integrity of the ash reef blocks had been maintained. The compressive strength and durability was better than the concrete artificial reefs nearby. The ash reefs could also attract fishes and the colonization by benthic organisms was similar to that on concrete reefs. Eighty-eight species of fishes were observed, of which 27 were commercially important, comprising more than 80% of the total biomass. These results demonstrate a potential use for stabilized coal ash as artificial reefs to replace traditionally used concrete reefs to protect and enhance the coastal fishery resources in Taiwan in the future. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

1995.0,Chem. Ecol.,Interactions Among the Copper Species and Forms in Sea WaterSediments and Copper Bioaccumulation Bioaccumulation in Oysters,Hung T;Meng P;Han B,"Earlier papers indicated that the first incident of green discoloration in oysters (Crassostrea gigas) and the mass mortality observed in 1986 along the Taiwan Erhjin Chi coastal area were caused by the higher contents of total copper and copper species (mainly bioavailable and free ion) in sea water. The copper in sea water would be sorbed by suspended matter and transferred to sediments, and the copper in the sediments would also be desorbed to sea water. Processes of copper adsorption and desorption are the major factors influencing the contents of total copper and copper species in sea water and sediments. In this study, the Erhjin Chi sediments were mixed with sea water by a shaker technique. When the mixture was shaken for one hour, analogous to tidal mixing in estuaries, only copper desorption from sediments was observed. If the shaking time is increased for more than 3 hours, the copper released from the sediments was resorbed to the remaining solid phases. The higher the contents of mud (91.71%) and total copper (701 mg kg ‘) in sediments, the higher the copper desorption rate (1.86 ppm hr’1) and copper adsorption rate (0.50 ppm hr’1) were observed. In sediments containing lower mud (0.80%) and lower copper (43.5 mg kg’1), the copper desorption and adsorption rates were 0.83 ppm hr'1 and 0.22 ppm hr’1, respectively. The interactions among the total copper and copper species in sea water and sediments, chemical and ecological parameters, and copper bioaccumulation in oysters in the Erhjin Chi estuarine and coastal area are also discussed. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

1995.0,Chem. Ecol.,Terrigenous Inputs and Accumulation of Trace Metals in the Southeastern Taiwan Strait,Hung J,"Terrigenous inputs and sedimentary fluxes of trace metals were studied to understand the metal sources, transport and sinks in the southeastern Taiwan Strait. The major terrigenous metals come from seven major rivers in the southwestern Taiwan, even though significant fractions of most metals were retained in estuaries. The net fluxes of river borne metals contributed from 65% (Pb) to 92% (Fe, Zn) of total inputs. The remainder was attributed to marine sewage discharges (0.6-6.9%) and atmospheric inputs (5.3-31.5%). Sedimentary fluxes of trace metals were spatially variable as a result of derivation from site-specific sedimentation rates and metal distributions in sediments. In spite of imbalance between sources and sinks of trace metals, an accumulation of metals in the sediment of southeastern Taiwan Strait was found for sites close to Taiwan Island. Surface enrichment of metals in near-shore sediments beginning around 1976 was coincident with a time of industrial boom in Taiwan. The metal enrichment hierarchy was found as (Cd, Pb > Cu > Zn > Mn, Fe). © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

1995.0,Chem. Ecol.,The coastal environmental characteristics of Taiwan,Fan K,"There are three major factors affecting the coastal environment in Taiwan: tidal current, long-shore current and land subsidence. In Taiwan, most industrial areas are located on the southwestern coast. Most of the pollutants from the factories are discharged directly to the ocean, harbours or rivers. The pollutants in harbours or rivers will eventually be delivered to coastal waters. There, the tidal current is the major force dispersing the pollutants nearshore. The polluted water extends to an area about 5 km on both sides from the discharge source, and within about 3~4 km off-shore, fn this study, Hsien-Da Harbour in southwestern Taiwan is cited to explain the effects of tidal current on the coastal environment. The long-shore current induced by breaking waves is the major force shaping the coastal morphology. Along the western coast of Taiwan, the long-shore current mainly flows northward along the southern section, and southward along the northern section. In the last one hundred years, in general, the coast has been eroded along the northern and southern sections of western coast, and some reclaimed lands were formed in the middle section. Recently, erosion in some coastal zones is quite serious because of excess groundwater extraction, especially along the southwestern coast. Groundwater extraction might also induce land subsidence. There are some areas near the coast which suffer serious land subsidence problems. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Through a series of experimental studies, we found that substitutes of coarse aggregate with a broad spectrum of integrating slag powder, fly ash, and cementitious material can be obtained with a benefit up to 80% saving of cement. The integrated aggregates from the non-poisonous industrial wastes were subsequently made into armour units and used in the field tests at Tai-Lin-Pu coastal area, where the shorelines are seriously eroded. After being subjected to several severe typhoon advents, the results showed that the waste-made units used as the protection breakwater, together with construction wastes and excavated soil as the filling material, prove to be an effective practice in utilizing recycled urban waste to reclaim erosive shore lands. Moreover, this study also demonstrates that through detailed analysis of the waste characteristics, scrap material could be turned into valuable construction aggregates, and highlights the value of non-poisonous urban and industrial waste as a alternative resource for the shore protection engineering. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

These two bivalves from Lu-kang contain more arsenic in soft tissues than specimens from other areas (significant at 1%, t-test). On the other hand, samples from Pen-hu contain less arsenic than those from other areas (significant at 5%). The arsenic contents of other Indo-Pacific bivalves are also given for comparison.","Institute of Zoology, Academia Sinica, Taipei, 115, Taiwan",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,1,1.0,,"Wu, W.-L.; Institute of Zoology, , Taipei, 115, Taiwan",Academia SinicaAcademia Sinica,"The author expresses his thanks to colleagues in the Malacology Laboratory, Tnsti-tute of Zoology, Academia Sinica in Taipei.

1996.0,Chem. Ecol.,Distribution of trace metals in the surface sediments of two pristine subalpine lakes in Taiwan,Wann J;Chen C,"Sediment cores were collected from two remote subalpine lakes: the rather shallow (1.5m) Little Ghost Lake at 2040 m elevation and the deeper. Great Ghost Lake (40 m) at 2150 m elevation. Different early diagenesis of metals were observed. The seasonally anoxic hypolimnion drives the annual iron redox cycle and causes the remobilization of metals in the mobile fractions of sediments in the Great Ghost Lake. These result in the redistribution of metals in the mobile fractions of sediment and poor correlation between metal concentrations. In the Little Ghost Lake, the shallow water column is always oxic with less change of metals in the mobile fractions of sediments. As a result, most metals have strong positive correlations with each other. The distributions of metal/Al ratios, total metal contents and acid-leached metal concentrations in the near-surface sediments of these two lakes suggest that the anthropogenic inputs from the atmospheric fallouts in recent decades are one of the major factors affecting the distributions of metals such as cadmium, lead and, to a lessor extent, zinc The Pb-206/Pb-207 ratios confirm the anthropogenic lead input in these surface sediments.","Institute of Marine Geology, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,,"Wann, J.-K.; Institute of Marine Geology, , Kaohsiung, Taiwan",,NA NA,Limnology;  Sediments; diagenesis;  Taiwan;  Trace metals,10.1080/02757549608035348,Article,anthropogenic input;  diagenesis;  lake sediment;  sedimentary geochemistry;  trace metal; Taiwan,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,Chemistry and Ecology,2,12,scopus,NATIONAL SUN YAT-SEN UNIVERSITY,INSTITUTE OF MARINE GEOLOGY,A

No vertical temperature stratification was observed in these shallow lakes. pH is neutral to alkaline and associated with vigorous algal growth. Nitrogen levels are high and present in various forms due to progressive nitrification. Green and blue-green algae play an important part in the process of nitrification. Assessment of lake eutrophication was made by the use of the N:P ratio, the Trophic State Index (TSI) and the US EPA Eutrophic Screening Model. The result of these calculations indicates eutrophic conditions in both lakes.

Ecol.,Liver metallothionein level and metal content in fish of ChungKung stream Taiwantilapia and Liza macrolepsis,Liu C;Huang H;Wang H;Chung P;Huang K,"A survey of Chung-Kung sttream fish was undertaken on six occasions from March 1994 to August 1995. Tilapia (Oreochromis hybrid) and Liza macrolepsis were the major species found downstream and were chosen as the target species for metallothionein (MT) analysis of liver tissue. In total MT of 77 tilapia and 48 Liza macrolepsis liver samples were analyzed. Significantly higher values (p <0.05) were found for the August 1995 samples than for samples taken earlier at site B (6 km from the sea) for tilapia and at site A (estuary) for Liza macrolepsis. Liver zinc, copper and cadmium were analyzed for the 1995 samples. For tilapia, liver MT concentration was found to correlate well with zinc concentration (r = 0.84, p < 0.001). For Liza macrolepsis, good correlation was found for MT with both zinc (r = 0.89. p < 0.001) and copper (r = 0.90, p < 0.001). These results indicate that in the Chung-Kung stream, zinc and copper may be the major inducers of fish liver MT. Since these two species are ubiquitous in tropical areas, they would provide a good biomarker for evaluation of integrated metal exposure in the tropical aquatic environment.","Natl.

Along the river, from a freshwater (0.0‰ salinity) to an oceanic (37.0‰ salinity) environment, five sampling stations were chosen to collect the sediment. Sediment slurries were incubated in an anaerobic mineral salts medium that was amended with multiple electron acceptors, including manganese (IV) and ferric (III) oxides, and the concentrations of the aromatic substrates were followed over a 3- to 4-month period. Most sediment samples showed a complete loss of benzoic acid and quinoline (0.12-0.21 mM) within approximately three months. Pyridine was transformed after a lag period of 53 days in the sediment slurries from the freshwater environment which had been amended with both metal oxide (either Fe (OH)3 or MnO2) and inhibitor (either BESA or molybdate). Pyridine was not transformed in other sediment slurries.

1996.0,Chem. Ecol.,Restoration of the marine ecological environment along the charting coast Primary productivity and biomass study,Hung T;Wu S;Chuang A,"Since 1986. when green oysters occurred due to the copper and organic pollution in the Charting coastal area, the government banned all maricultural activity. It has been claimed that growing algae in a polluted environment may clean the water of pollutants and restore the marine ecosystem. To test this hypothesis, in the Charting coastal area a three-year programme (from August 1992 to July 1995) was carried out The survey programme included environmental components such as salinity, temperature. pH, dissolved oxygen, biological oxygen demand (BOD), participate organic carbon (POC), heavy metals and ecological indicators such as nutrients, chlorophyll-a, primary productivity. In the first year study, the environmental background data collected was used to select the suitable season and locations for growing large algae transferred from the laboratory to the field study area. Since September 1993, various species of large algae have been cultured. Although some of the growing algae were damaged by a typhoon in August 1994, the impact of the growing algae on the environmental conditions in the area has been monitored throughout. Elsewhere, we have reported that in the algae growing area higher dissolved oxygen with lower values of BOD and POC were found, and the concentrations of heavy metals in both water and sediments decreased. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the possible impact of growing large algae on the ecological conditions in Charting coastal waters through the period from August 1983 to May 1995. As a result of the positive results obtained, large amounts of algae have again been cultured in the same area during the period from April 29 to May 25, 1995. We expect that inorganic and organic pollutants will be reduced by the algal growth, oyster mariculture will be restored and finally, the fishery resources potential will be increased.","Institute of Oceanography, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan; Institute of Chemistry, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,,"Hung, T.-C.; Institute of Oceanography, , Taipei, Taiwan",,NA NA,Chlorophyll-a;  Mariculture;  Mitigation of marine pollution;  Nutrients;  Primary productivity;  Taiwan,10.1080/02757549608035344,Article,algae;  algal culture;  coastal water;  coastal waters;  macroalgae;  marine environment;  remediation;  restoration; Taiwan; Charting,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,Chemistry and Ecology,2,12,scopus,NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY;INSTITUTE OF CHEMISTRY,INSTITUTE OF OCEANOGRAPHY,A
1996.0,Chem. Ecol.,Restoration of the marine ecological environment along the charting coastal area Chemical studies,Hung T;Meng P;Wu S;Chuang A,"The Charting coastal area is an important mariculture and fishery ground in Taiwan. Due to copper and organic pollution, mariculture has been prohibited by the Taiwan Government since the first case of green oysters appeared in this area in 1986. Growing algae in the polluted environment may improve water quality and re-establish the marine ecosystem. Since September, 1993, various algal species (such as Ulva, Sargassum, Crateloupia, Halymenia, Galaxura, etc.) have been cultured in the Charting coastal area. Although some of the cultivated algae were damaged by a typhoon in August, 1944, the environmental and ecological effect of the cultivated algae is still evident. The non-biological and biological components surveyed include: salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). paniculate organic carbon (POC), nutrients, heavy metals and chlorophyll-a, adenosine triphosphate, primary productivity, species composition and intra-specific relationships of phyto- and zoo-plankton. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the possible impact before and during culture of large algae on the heavy metals and organic pollution of water and sediments over the period August 1992 to May 1995. The results indicate that during algal culture, higher levels of dissolved oxygen (6.1-7.6 mg 1-1) with lower BOD (0.4-2.3 mg1-1) and POC (20.6-948 μg 1-1) were found. The concentrations of copper (0.02-4.74 μg 1-1), zinc (0.90-12.3 μg 1-1), lead ( &lt; 0.05-1.47 μm 1-1) and cadmium ( &lt; 0.02-0.14 μg 1-1) also decreased. As a result of these positive findings, the cultivation area of algae was expanded in 1995. We expect that with extended algal cultivation, inorganic and organic pollutants will be minimized, and that the marine ecosystem and oyster mariculture will be restored.","Institute of Oceanography, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan; Institute of Chemistry, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,4,1.0,,"Hung, T.-C.; Institute of Oceanography, , Taipei, Taiwan",,NA NA,Charting sea;  Heavy metals;  Mariculture;  Marine ecosystem recovery;  Organic pollutants;  Oysters;  Water quality,10.1080/02757549608035343,Article,algal culture;  chemical pollutants;  heavy metals;  organic pollution;  remediation; Taiwan; Charting,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,Chemistry and Ecology,2,12,scopus,NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY;INSTITUTE OF CHEMISTRY,INSTITUTE OF OCEANOGRAPHY,A
1996.0,Chem. Ecol.,Sensitivity of ozone production to the NMHC composition aerosol backscattering and high chimney emission,Liu C,"In this paper, three sensitivity studies are designed to analyze the effect of the NMHC (Non-Methane HydroCarbon) composition, the aerosol back-scattering and the high chimney NOx emission to the photochemical prodution of ozone by using a one-dimensional photochemistry-diffusion model under a favourable meteorological condition. Measurements of the NMHC composition in Taipei indicated that the percentage of iso-butene, cis-2-butene, trans-2-butene and benzene in a unit volume was much higher than of those observed in other major cities. The high ratio of benzene was directly linked to its high percentage in gasoline. As to the unusually high amount of iso-butene, cis-2-butene and trans-2-butene, more researches are needed to identify their source. Concerns are raised as to how productive is NMHC composition is to the photochemical production of the surface ozone. A rough estimate shows that the total reactivity of the Taipei NMHC composition is about 1.21 × 10-9 cm3 s-1 which is 1.6 times that of the Los Angeles (LA) NMHC composition, while the simulated noon peak will be different by 28 ppbv, i.e. 18% more than that simulated with a LA composition. Meanwhile, high aerosol loading is a serious problem in Taipei. The attenuation of the UV radiation by aerosols cannot be ignored. A numerical simulation shows that the noon ozone level will decrease from 178 to 141ppbv, i.e. about 21% reduction, with deterioration of the visual range from 85 to 5 km. In the southern Taiwan, industry parks are mixed with the populated Kaohsiung city, hence the large emission of NOx from high chimneys cannot be ignored. In this study, NOx is assumed to be emitted in the layer between 235-460 m high with an emission rate of 0.05 or 0.145 ppbv/sec. The results show that the NOx emitted from the elevated stack lead to a considerable reduction of surface ozone. Such conclusion is obtained due to the fact that a one-dimensional model is used in this paper. Whereas, if a three-dimensional regional model was used, then a higher productivity of ozone downstream would be simulated.","Department of Atmospheric Sciences, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,1,1.0,,"Liu, C.-M.; Department of Atmospheric Sciences, , Taipei, Taiwan",,NA NA,Aerosol effect;  High chimney effect (NOx);  NMHC composition;  Ozone modeling;  Sensitivity studies,10.1080/02757549608035355,Article,,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,Chemistry and Ecology,0,12,scopus,NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY,DEPARTMENT OF ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES,A
1996.0,Chem. Ecol.,Source and effect of heavy metal pollution in the coastal Taiwan sediments,Lin S;Chen C,"Coastal sediments and oyster farming is severely affected by the industrial effluents in the coastal region near LuGong, Taiwan. Surficial sediments and oyster samples were collected from a coastal area near a major electro-plating industry. Spatial variation in heavy metal contents in sediments was studied in relationship to the main pathway of contamination and geochemical association with natural constituents of the sediments. Spatial trends of heavy metals in the sediment reflected inputs of pollutants from the poorly-treated electro-plating effluents in the surrounding county and transported downstream by the Yang-tse-tru River. Effluent related heavy metal (Zn. Cu, Cd) is extremely high in the study region sediments. The highest concentrations were observed near shore, especially upstream in the Yang-tse-tru River sediments. Heavy metal concentrations decreased rapidly in a seaward direction. Heavy metal concentrations in near shore sediments were as high as some highly industrialized harbour sediments in the USA (e.g. Boston and San Diego). Significant differences and high concentrations of heavy metals were also observed in oysters from the study region. Heavy metals from the study region were two to five times higher than in oysters from other pristine areas in Taiwan.","Institute of Oceanography, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan; Environmental Safety.

1996.0,Chem. Ecol.,Spatial variations of heavy metals in the East China Sea Continental shelf surface sediments,Lin S;Chen C,"Surface sediments collected from continental shelf of the East China Sea were analyzed for heavy metals (iron, manganese, copper, zinc, lead, cadmium), carbonate, organic carbon contents, and grain sizes. The range of concentrations observed were iron: 0.3-1.3 wt%, manganese: 2.3-14 μmole/g, copper: 7.1-184 μmole/g, zinc: 0.16-0.77 μmole/g, lead: 15-98 μmole/g, cadmium: 0.17-3.9 μmole/g, carbonate: 3.6-87 wt%, sand: 10-100%, silt: 0-70% and clay: 0-50%. A zonal distribution pattern of the heavy metals was found in the East China Sea Continental shelf sediments. High concentrations of most heavy metals, organic carbon and fine-grained sediments were observed in the inner shelf zone, especially those near the discharge of the Yangtze River. Concentrations of these heavy metals decreased from the inner shelf to the shelf break region. High concentrations of metals were also found in sediments near Taiwan. Iron concentrations decreased north-east of the central shelf region. High concentrations of cadmium were found in the shelf break region where biogenic carbonate is predominant. This study showed that biogenic carbonate in the East China Sea shelf break region and the terrigenous sediments from the Yangtze River and island of Taiwan were the major sources of heavy metals. Heavy metal concentrations were strongly influenced by the content of the coarse-grained quartz sand present in the sediments.","Institute of Oceanography, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan; Environmental Safety Inc., No.101, Sung-Chiang Rd., Taipei, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,,"Lin, S.; Institute of Oceanography, , Taipei, Taiwan",,NA NA,East China Sea Continental shelf;  Heavy metals;  Reactive metals;  Sediments;  Spatial variation,10.1080/02757549608035521,Article,; heavy metal;  contamination;  continental shelf;  continental shelves;  heavy metal;  heavy metals;  marine sediment;  surface sediments; East China Sea,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,Chemistry and Ecology,10,13,scopus,NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY;ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY INC.,INSTITUTE OF OCEANOGRAPHY,A

A total of 45 species belonging to seven orders and 25 families were caught at 6 sites along the stream. There were ten species of Cyprinidae, and four or fewer of the other 24 families. Major species found upstream at site F were Varicorhinus barbatulus and Hemimyzon formosanum. This section of the stream is considered unpolluted if these water quality sensitive species are present. Acrossocheilus formosanus and Crossostoma lacustre can thrive in slightly polluted water and occurred in the middle reaches at site D. Zacco pachycephalus could also survive in mildly polluted water and occurred at site C. The major species at site B were tilapia (Oreochromis hybrid species) and thus this section was considered heavily polluted. Site A in the lower, tidal, reaches contained species of Mugilidae and was considered as moderately polluted. Thirty seven fish muscle samples were analyzed for residues of nine organochlorine pesticides. Only 4-4′DDD was detected in the majority of the samples (70%). Trace amounts of heptachlor-epoxide, endrin, 4,4′ DDT (&lt;10 ng g-1) were found in 13-23% of samples.

Most of the fish collected are pollution-resistant species such as Oreochromis spp, Liza macrolepsis, Channa spp and Megalops cyprinoides. The most polluted river sections are in the upstream where large amount of waste effluents from households, livestock rearing and nearby dumping sites were discharged into the river, and the lower reaches of the river where metal recovery activities including open burning of waste electrical wire/scrap occurred. Sediment samples collected near the burning site show 2,3,7,8-TCDD toxicity equivalents (TEQ) ranging from 0.014 to 14.2 ng g-1 by PCDD/DFs and from 0.015 to 1.03 ng g-1 by coplanar PCBs (Co-PCBs). The fish samples show TEQ ranging from 0.029 to 0.615 ng g-1 by PCDD/DFs and from 0.012 to 0.12 ng g-1 by Co-PCBs. Possible PCDD/DFs sources are discharged PCBs, open burning of waste wire/scrap, and pentachlorophenol. The consumption of these fish will cause an average intake of 54 pg kg-1 d-1 TEQ. The prevention of direct discharge of livestock and the dumping of waste effuenis into River Er-Jen as well as the control of metal recovery activities appears to be the first step toward the restoration of River Er-Jen.","Department of Chemistry, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan; Natl.

1998.0,Chem. Ecol.,Application of remote sensing in detection of ocean oil pollution,Juang J;Chen K;Chen C;Chang L,"It is well known that the increase of surface tension due to the presence of oil slicks causes the surface wave motion is depressed or even disappeared, thus making the surface electromagnetically smoother. Therefore, the radar backscattered energy is correspondingly decreased. These damping effects is now well understood and such effects enables the oil slicks to be discernible from the radar image. In this paper, we are concerned with the digital technique that effectively delineates the oil slicks pattern from the SAR image. The detected pattern allows us to estimate the coverage of oil spillage. The technique is based on the fact that the oil slicks make a gray value surface in the image which is a concave area with a certain size. In order to identify correctly these oil slicks and suppress the speckle noise and other natural phenomena, an image pyramid with multi-resolution layers is generated sequentially from the original image. Then a top-down approach, which applies both first and second order derivative operators, the Difference of Gaussian (DoG) and the Laplace of Gaussian (LoG), to the image pyramid, is used to detect oil patches. Two ERS-1 SAR images acquired on August 5, 1994 and September 5, 1994, around Taiwan, were used for testing. Results indicate that the proposed method depresses the speckle noise and other sea noise signals, and enhances the oil slicks pattern clearly. The robustness to the empirical parameters introduced in this scheme was also demonstrated.","Inst. of Harbor and Mar. Technology, Taichung 435, Taiwan; Ctr.

1998.0,Chem. Ecol.,Ecological survey of coastal water adjacent to nuclear power plants in Taiwan,Hung T;Huang C;Shao K,"A total of six nuclear reactors installed in three power plants, two along the northern and one along the southern coasts of Taiwan, started their operations one after another since October 1977. Owing to the large quantities of cooling water intake into and discharge from the plants, some environmental factors such as water temperature, chlorine, environmental radioactivity and nearshore currents may be significantly changed. Variations of these abiotic environmental factors may influence the biological activities in the ecosystem, particularly doing some kinds of damage to marine biological resources. Therefore, the possible environmental impact upon the biological systems including the fishery resources along the northern and southern coasts of Taiwan should be studied before and during the plant operation. We have started the long-term programmes of biological, chemical and hydrographical surveys of the nuclear power plant sites on both northern (since July 1974) and southern (since July 1979) coasts of Taiwan. The survey items include ocean currents, physical and chemical properties of sea water, primary productivity, specific compositions and interspecific relationships among phyto- and zooplankton, algae, invertebrates, corals, and fishes; and radionuclides in water and biological specimens, and fishery statistics. In general, except for a few events, the operations of the six units of nuclear power plants have not produced detectable effects on the marine ecosystem. Radio-activity levels and radionuclides in water and the biological specimens remained the same as background levels throughout the survey period. However, the events of coral bleaching and fish body anomalies caused by thermal discharges were observed respectively along the outlets of third and second Nuclear Power Plants. The purposes of this paper are to report and evaluate these two events during the operations of nuclear power plants in Taiwan.","Institute of Oceanography, National Taiwan University, Taipei 107, Taiwan; Institute of Chemistry, Academia Sinica, Taipei 115, Taiwan; Institute of Zoology, Academia Sinica, Taipei 115, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,,"Hung, T.-C.; Institute of Oceanography, , Taipei 107, Taiwan",,NA NA,Coral bleaching;  Fish skeletal deformation;  Marine ecosystem;  Nuclear power plants,,Article,,,Chemistry and Ecology,0,14-15,scopus,NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY;INSTITUTE OF CHEMISTRY;INSTITUTE OF ZOOLOGY,INSTITUTE OF OCEANOGRAPHY,A

According to these results, concentration of suspended particulate matter in the inner shelf of southern China Sea, the upwelling-influenced shelf break, and in Kuroshio water are 1.30 (surface)-4-2 (bottom) mgl-1, ca. 0.4mg-1 and 0.1-0-2 mgl-1, respectively, reflecting various influences of terrestrial inputs. A benthic nepheloid layer (BNL), apparently owing to resuspension of local and/ or remote bottom sediments, formed over the shelf region. Temporal variations in trace metal contents and enrichments in suspended matter from the shelf region reflect the variation of metal inputs from Chinese rivers, particularly from the Changjiang runoff. The enriched metals are more likely to be derived from anthropogenic input, rather than from biological accumulation. In addition, a decrease in metal contents and an increase in salinity confirm the transport of suspended particulate metals from the East China Sea shelf to the open ocean. The feature of metal plume in the intermediate layer (550-800 m) of Kuroshio water also verifies this occurrence. Moreover, the sinking particles collected from a sediment trap on the upper slope are relatively enriched in lithogenic matter and trace metals, suggesting the deposit of anthropogenic metals in the slope area.","Inst. of Mar.

1998.0,Chem. Ecol.,Fluxes and transport of organic carbon and trace metals in the tropical tsengwen estuary Southwestern Taiwan,Hung J,"Distributions of organic carbon and trace metals were investigated in the tropical Tsengwen river end-member and in the estuary to better understand thoroughly the riverine fluxes and estuarine transports of constituents into the sea. Experimental results indicated that riverine fluxes of organic carbon and trace metals possessed a highly temporal variability, attributed primarily to temporal variation in river water discharge and suspended load. More than 70% of annual fluxes of dissolved constituents and &gt;90% of particulate constituents arose from river floods caused by summer typhoons. The flushing time of fresh water in the estuary varied from a half month in the dry season to a half day in the flood period. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nutrient-type metals (Cd, Cu, Zn) were conservatively transported through the estuary. Dissolved particle-reactive metals (Mn, Pb), however, were apparently transported non-conservatively through the estuary. Particulate organic carbon (POC) and trace metals (PTM) were transported non-conservatively by following the transport mode of total suspended matter (TSM) in the estuary. DOC slightly dominates the transport of organic carbon while particle-reactive PTM predominates the transport of trace metals through the estuary. Total organic carbon (TOC) in estuarine sediment was progressively enriched with 13C downstream, as derived by mixing the overlying TSM between terrestrial and marine end-members. Distributions of trace metals in sediment were subsequently controlled by sedimentary TOC and particle size. Based on results presented here, we believe that enrichments of trace metals in the estuary are attributed primarily to the natural processes of transport and sedimentation of fluvial TSM.","Inst. of Mar.

1998.0,Chem. Ecol.,Lead210 and beryllium7 in the aerosol particles around Taiwan offshore areas,Chung Y;Chen P,"Distributions of 210Pb and 7Be in the aerosol particles of different size fractions were measured around Taiwan offshore areas from October, 1994 to October, 1995. The size distribution and abundance of the aerosol particles showed both spatial and temporal variations. The particle concentrations off northwestern Taiwan were more than twice as those off northeastern Taiwan both in November and March, and the values were much higher in November than in March for both areas. The measured particle concentrations, except for one sample with an unusually high value, ranged from 10 to 83 μgm-3 in the study areas. The 210Pb concentrations in the aerosol particles filtered from the air mass varied between 20×10-3 and 72×10-3 (1 dpm = 0.45 pCi). The 210Pb concentrations in the area off southwestern Taiwan appeared somewhat higher than in other areas and were probably contributed by the land air from Taiwan which contains higher 210Pb in winter. The 210Pb concentrations off northern Taiwan were low in November when the aerosol concentrations were high, but they were high in March when the aerosol concentrations were low. Based on the 7Be monitoring records of 20 years on the aerosol particles of the island by the Taiwan Radiation Monitoring Center, the mean settling rate averaged 0.91, 0.79 and 0.68 cm s-1, respectively, in northern, central and southern Taiwan. With these values and the 210Pb concentrations in the aerosols, the 210Pb flux was determined to be between 0.58 and 2.30 dpm cm-2y-1, with an average of 1.19 dpm cm-2y-1. Excluding the highest value due to its extremely high 210Pb and aerosol concentrations, the average is reduced to 1.05 dpm cm-2y-1. The activity median diameters (AMD) for 210Pb in the study areas were between 0.69 and &lt; 0.49 μm with a mean of 0.5 μm based on 210Pb distributions in different particle size fractions. Thus, 210Pb was preferentially adsorbed on to the submicron particles. 7Be in the study areas showed a good correlation with 210Pb in total activity although the two nuclides had different sources.","Inst. of Mar.

1998.0,Chem. Ecol.,Metal concentration in oyster Crassostrea gigas and sediment in Annping mariculture ground Taiwan,Lee C;Wang T;Hsu C;Lay S,"This study was to assess the metal contamination in oyster tissue grown in the Ann-ping mariculture ground in Taiwan, The information generated from this work also revealed general metal pollution problem for Taiwan's oyster farmers. Oysters, Crassostrea gigas, and surficial sediments collected from ten locations in Ann-ping mariculture ground in Taiwan for metals concentration (Cu, Zn, Pd, Cd, Fe and Mn) were performed. Analytical results indicated that the yearly averaged oyster copper concentrations (μg g-1, wet weight) in oyster soft parts from Ann-ping increased from 21.3±4.1 in 1993; 24.1±6.8 in 1994: 36.8±11.9 in 1995 to 43.9±23.1μg g-1, wet weight, in the 1996 raising season. The mean oyster copper concentration reached a level of 50 μg g-1, wet weight, in December 1996. This increasing trend of metal concentration in oyster tissue indicates a potential pollution source which may pose a potential disaster as green oyster incidence, which occurred on the Charting coast in 1986, in Taiwan. Sediment samples in Ann-ping mariculture ground were also collected and examined. The seasonal variation of the copper concentration in surficial sediment from Ann-ping did not show an increasing trend as observed in oyster tissue.","Department of Marine Environment, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Harbor Br.

1998.0,Chem. Ecol.,Sedimentary pigments and organic matter in relation to benthic fauna in the TanShui estuary Taiwan,Chu K;Chiu Y;Yao N;Chen L,"The benthic ecological structure of the Tan-Shui estuary. Taiwan is changed due to long term effects of dumping of urban wastewater and of engineering actions. To monitor these changes, we sampled and analyzed benthos and sediment from 12 stations on the estuary. The composition of the dominant species of benthos varied seasonally, with molluscan and crustacean species having greater numbers and higher frequencies of occurrence than other species. The dominant taxa during winter were Nassarius sp. and Maldanidae at two stations. Analysis using Simpson's index and Shannon's index showed the benthic community varied more in coastal areas than in offshore areas. Physicochemical analysis showed that most of the Tan-Shui estuary consisted of sandy sediment. The variations in concentrations of organic carbon and total nitrogen at each station were small. Although the concentrations of chlorophyll-a and carotenoid at all stations were generally low, the two stations had the highest concentrations, and we concluded that the concentration of pigments in these sediments was related to the abundance of benthos. The community structure of the benthos reflected the characteristics of the sediments, and benthic species exhibited selection of and adaptation to specific sedimentary environments.","Department of Applied Mathematics, Chinese Culture University, Taiwan; Department of Biology, Chinese Culture University, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,,4,1.0,,,,NA NA,Benthos;  Organic matter;  Sediment;  Taiwan,10.1080/02757549808037623,Article,,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,Chemistry and Ecology,0,14-15,scopus,,,A

Ecol.,Study on the hydraulic characteristics of Taichung Harbour in Taiwan,Tseng Z;Chou H;Juang J,"For this study, field measurements of current profiles, buoy trajectories and the lag of two tidal stations were performed to explore the flow characteristics of Taichung Harbour. In order to distinguish the effects of wind drift current on circulation inside Taichung Harbour, field surveys during both summer and monsoon (winter) season were completed separately. The speed of the drift current was about 3.5% that of the wind speed, based on the field data. The horizontal dispersion coefficients were close to Bowden's (1965) formula for the tidal current. The water temperature showed a two-layer profile, with the mixing thickness about 4 to 6 metres for the upper layer. The corresponding Richardson number was about 70. The tidal lag between the two tidal stations was 9.68 minutes. All the results agree well with the theoretical results.","Inst. of Harbour and Mar.

The orders of heavy metal concentrations (dry weight) in demersal fishes were: copper (over 100 μg g-1), T. jarbua ≥ A. australis &gt; M. cyprinoides &gt; P. dupliciocellatus; zinc (over 500 μg g-1), L. bohar &gt; T. jarbua &gt; P. dupliciocellatus &gt; S. sihama; lead (over 4 μg g-1), P. dupliciocellatus &gt; S. guttotus; nickel (over 5 μg g-1), S. guttotus &gt; S. sihama; chromium (over 20 μg g-1), P. dupliciocellatus &gt; L. bohar &gt; T. jarbua; arsenic (over 1 μg g-1), A. australis &gt; M. cyprinoides; tin (over 3 μg g-1), L. bohar. For the pelagic fishes, high values of nickel and chromium were found in S. jello. Higher concentrations of heavy metals were generally observed in livers compared with those in gills, guts, eggs and flesh of demersal fish. Significant correlations were also obtained between heavy metal contents in fish and fish livers. The seasonal and regional variations as well as their impact on sedimentary heavy metal concentrations are evaluated and discussed. © 1999 OPA (Overseas Publishers Association) N.V.

Results indicate that higher percentages of P1 and P2 for copper, zinc, lead, cadmium and manganese in samples collected in March and September of 1990 were much higher than those in P3 - P6. High percentages of chromium and iron in samples respectively collected in March and September of 1990 were found in P6. For the seven phase analysis, higher percentages of copper species in PB4 and PB6 as well as iron species in PB7 were observed. On the other hand, purified humic acid with the high contents of manganese and iron in humic acid as well as purified fulvic acids were generally found at the upstream stations; and low values at coastal stations. However, extremely high copper (as high as 1750 μg g-1, dry weight in fulvic acid and 820 μg g-1 in humic acid) and lead (821 μg g-1 in humic acid) concentrations with relatively high manganese and iron concentrations were observed in humic substances from the station near the copper recycling area.

2013.0,Chem. Ecol.,Distribution enrichment accumulation and potential ecological risks of mercury in the sediments of Kaohsiung Harbor Taiwan,Dong C;Chen C;Chen C,"The distribution, enrichment, accumulation and potential ecological risks of mercury (Hg) in the surface sediments of Kaohsiung Harbor, Taiwan, were investigated. Sediment samples from 20 locations throughout Kaohsiung Harbor were collected quarterly from 2006 to 2011, and characterised for mercury, aluminium, water content, organic matter, total nitrogen, total phosphorous, total grease and grain size. The results showed that Hg concentrations varied from 0.06-6.73 mg kg-1 with an average of 0.54±0.71 mg kg-1. The spatial distribution of Hg reveals that the Hg concentration is relatively higher in the river mouth regions, especially at the Love River and Canon River mouths from where it gradually diminishes toward the harbour entrance region. The results from the enrichment factor and geo-accumulation index analyses reveal that the sediments near the Love River and Canon River mouths experience severe enrichment and strong accumulation of Hg that originates from upstream sources of pollution. The assessment of biological effects indicates that concentrations of 92.5% Hg found in the sediment are higher than effects range low, implying that the harbour sediments may cause an adverse impact on aquatic lives. The results of a potential ecological risk index indicate that the sediment has higher to serious levels of ecological potential risks. © 2013 Taylor &amp; Francis.","Department of Marine Environmental Engineering, National Kaohsiung Marine University, Kaohsiung 81157, Taiwan",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,,"Chen, C.-W.; Department of Marine Environmental Engineering, , Kaohsiung 81157, Taiwan; 電子郵件: cwchen@mail.nkmu.edu.tw",,"This research was supported by the Kaohsiung Harbor Bureau, Taiwan.

Results from the sampling site at Westin Park indicated that the lowest particulate dry deposition and lowest average particulate concentrations in total suspended particles (TSP) occurred in September (29.70±7.47 μ g m-2×min) and February (34.38±13.60 ng m-3), respectively. Moreover, results from the Gung-Ming junior high school (airport) site, showed that the highest average particulate dry deposition and average highest particulate concentrations in TSP occurred in February (156.76±30.36 μ g m-2×min) and January (125.49±9.51 ng m-3), respectively, during the winter. The Dragon Steel Plant and Han-Shian Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation were both nearby. These factors led to the high Hg(p) concentrations at Taichung Airport (TA) compared with Westin Park.

1990.0,Chem. Geol.,A STABLEISOTOPE STUDY OF THE HYDROTHERMAL ALTERATION OF THE EAST TAIWAN OPHIOLITE,YUI T;JENG R,"The East Taiwan Ophiolite (ETO) occurs as allochthonous fragments in the Lichi Melange and has been suggested to have formed at an active ridge-ridge transform fault in a marginal basin. The brecciated plutonic sequence has experienced a pre-brecciation ocean-ridge type high-temperature metamorphism as well as a post-brecciation off-axis type low-temperature metamorphism, whereas the extrusive sequence has been subjected only to an off-axis low-temperature hydrothermal alteration. Stable-isotopic studies of the ETO show a slightly decreasing trend in oxygen-isotope compositions from basalt through plagiogranite/gabbro to ultramafic rocks. The isotopic compositions of the ETO basalts indicate low-temperature interaction with seawater under variable water/rock ratios. The amphiboles from the ETO gabbro show low delta-O-18- (i.e. + 3.1 to + 3.8-parts-per-thousand) and high delta-D- (i.e. - 19 to - 9-parts-per-thousand) values. This is interpreted as having resulted from high-temperature interaction with seawater-derived hydrothermal fluid. The plagioclase in the gabbro is mostly albitic in composition and exhibits very high delta-O-18-values (i.e. > + 12.0-parts-per thousand), which may have resulted from low-temperature reaction with O-18-enriched fluid. Such O-18-enriched fluid may have been derived from a high-temperature seawater-plutonic rock interaction system. The antigorite- and lizardite/chrysotile-serpentinites in the ETO formed in oceanic environments under pre- and post-brecciation metamorphic conditions, respectively. The isotopic compositions of the antigorite are compatible with its formation in an oceanic environment. Although the delta-O-18-values of the lizardites/chrysolites are comparable to those of oceanic serpentines, their delta-D-values, ranging from -91 to 57-parts-per-thousand, are too low to be accounted for by reaction sea-water-derived fluid. Post-formation hydrogen-isotope exchange between the lizardite/chrysotile and local meteoric waters during/after on-land emplacement of the serpentinites is postulated as a probable explanation. Calcite veins are ubiquitous in the ETO. Three carbon sources are identified: inorganic seawater carbon, juvenile carbon and organic carbon. In the last case, it is shown that some calcite veins may contain a substantial amount of CO2 derived from the CH4 oxidation process. The organic carbon was most likely derived from organics in the surrounding Lichi mudstone. Therefore, the calcite veins with an organic carbon signature are suggested to have formed after the ETO emplacement within the Lichi Melange.","CENT GEOL SURVEY,TAIPEI,TAIWAN.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,1.0,"YUI, TF (corresponding author), ACAD SINICA,INST EARTH SCI,TAIPEI 115,TAIWAN.",,,,10.1016/0009-2541(90)90060-K,Article,MID-OCEAN RIDGES; HYDROGEN ISOTOPE; OXYGEN ISOTOPE; ULTRAMAFIC ROCKS; SUBMARINE BASALTS; CARBON ISOTOPE; METAMORPHISM; SERPENTINIZATION; FRACTIONATION; WATER,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,CHEMICAL GEOLOGY,14,89,ISI,,INST EARTH SCI,B2

Combined with early published stable isotopic data for geothermal waters and carbonates from the same area, it is shown that the rocks in this field have undergone an increasing degree of O-isotope exchange with the geothermal waters at progressively higher temperatures (i.e. greater depth). The water/rock ratios in such a water-rock interaction system were estimated to be lower than 0.58. Such low values may be due to the very low permeability of the rocks. © 1993.","Institute of Earth Sciences, Academia Sinica, P.O.

These Al-Fe-rich rocks have been metamorphosed under amphibolite-/greenschist-facies conditions, leading to the formation of garnet-chloritoid rocks/chloritoid-rich rocks. The chemical changes along three profiles, from metabasite to garnet-chloritoid rock, show prominent K, Rb, Cs and Ba enrichment, yet, also, a large depletion of other elements if it is assumed that Ti, Zr, Nb, Ta and Hf remained relatively immobile. The REE's, however, behaved non-coherently. These chemical characteristics are attributed to pre-metamorphic processes and are shown to be similar to those observed with submarine weathering of basaltic rocks. In contrast, the chloritoid-rich rocks reveal distinct K, Rb, Cs and Ba depletion. It is suggested that this resulted from subaerial weathering processes. K enrichment is not an uncommon feature in Paleozoic/Precambrian paleosols. The present case study demonstrates that submarine weathering should be considered as a probable cause.","UNIV WESTERN ONTARIO, DEPT GEOL, LONDON N6A 5B7, ON, CANADA.; MOEA, CENT GEOL SURVEY, TAIPEI, TAIWAN.; NATL TAIWAN UNIV, DEPT GEOL, TAIPEI, TAIWAN.;",CANADA;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,CANADA,TAIWAN,5,2.0,1.0,"YUI, TF (corresponding author), ACAD SINICA, INST EARTH SCI, TAIPEI, TAIWAN.",,,,10.1016/0009-2541(94)90176-7,Article,PRECAMBRIAN ATMOSPHERIC COMPOSITION; RARE-EARTH ELEMENTS; ALKALINE-EARTHS; EASTERN ALPS; PALEOSOLS; MOBILITY; FRACTIONATION; GEOCHEMISTRY; RELEVANCE; ENVIRONMENT,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,CHEMICAL GEOLOGY,11,118,ISI,UNIV WESTERN ONTARIO;NATL TAIWAN UNIV,INST EARTH SCI,B2

1995.0,Chem. Geol.,TAIWAN AS A WITNESS OF REPEATED MANTLE INPUTS SRNDO ISOTOPIC GEOCHEMISTRY OF TAIWAN GRANITOIDS AND METAPELITES,LAN C;LEE T;JAHN B;YUI T,"To aid a better understanding of the crustal evolution of SE China, isotopic studies of mid-Cretaceous granitoids and associated late Paleozoic metapelites of the basement complex of Taiwan have been undertaken. Initial epsilon(Nd)-values and Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios for the granitoids range from - 12 to + 1 and 0.7051 to 0.7108, respectively, suggesting a heterogeneous nature of their protoliths. Furthermore, these initial Nd and Sr isotopic ratios define a covariant array lying between those of nearby metabasites and metapelites. This indicates that the sources of granitoids could well be two-component mixtures of a depleted component of mantle origin (fresh to altered oceanic crust with epsilon(Nd) = + 11 and Sr-87/Sr-86 = 0.703-0.708, represented by the adjacent amphibolite)and an enriched continental component (epsilon(Nd) = - 12 and Sr-87/Sr-86 = 0.712, represented by the metapelites), with the latter making up from 15% to 60%. Oxygen isotope data are also consistent with this mixing model. Nd model ages with respect to the depleted mantle reservoir (TDM) for Taiwan granitoids range from 0.9 to 1.5 Ga. These model ages are slightly younger than those of the S-type granitoids of SE China and world-wide Phanerozoic sedimentary rocks, implying a significant contribution from juvenile material. Similar to the granitoids, Taiwan metapelites are also heterogeneous in Nd and Sr isotopic compositions with each body possessing its own characteristic ranges. Nd crustal residence ages (T-DM) for Taiwan metapelites range from 1.1 to 1.6 Ga which are younger (1.5-2.3 Ga) than those of the Paleozoic sediments of South China. Thus, the oldest sediments in the Taiwan basement received not only recycled continental crustal material but also fresh mantle input. Therefore, Taiwan is a good witness of at least three episodes of fresh mantle inputs to the crust of the Eurasian continent: the ongoing accretion of the intra-oceanic Luzon Are, the Mesozoic event recorded in granitoids and the Paleozoic event recorded in metapelites.","NATL TAIWAN UNIV,DEPT GEOL,TAIPEI 10764,TAIWAN.; NATL TAIWAN UNIV,DEPT PHYS,TAIPEI 10764,TAIWAN.; UNIV RENNES,CNRS,RENNES,FRANCE.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;FRANCE,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,4,1.0,1.0,"LAN, CY (corresponding author), ACAD SINICA,INST EARTH SCI,TAIPEI 115,TAIWAN.",,,,10.1016/0009-2541(95)00056-R,Article,TECTONIC EVOLUTION; PENINSULAR RANGES; SIERRA-NEVADA; CHINA; SEDIMENTS; NEODYMIUM; CONSTRAINTS; ORIGIN; ROCKS; MODEL,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,CHEMICAL GEOLOGY,32,124,ISI,NATL TAIWAN UNIV;NATL TAIWAN UNIV;UNIV RENNES,INST EARTH SCI,B2
1999.0,Chem. Geol.,Fluid inclusion studies of the Chinkuashih highsulfidation goldcopper deposits in Taiwan,Wang Y;Sasaki M;Sasada M;Chen C,"Epithermal high-sulfidation Au-Cu deposits at Chinkuashih in northeastern Taiwan are found both within Pleistocene calc-alkaline volcanic rocks and the Miocene sedimentary rocks. The deposits consist of gold-copper veins of the Penshan group and breccia pipes of the Tushihshan-Changjen group. Primary two-phase inclusions in hydrothermal quartz and secondary two-phase inclusions in hydrothermal quartz as well as igneous quartz phenocrysts probably represent fluids related to mineralization, These inclusions have homogenization temperatures generally between 190 degrees C and 280 degrees C and salinities mostly from 0.5-5.0 wt.% NaCl eq. In the Penshan group, microthermometric data indicate that variable amounts of bailing, mixing and cooling occurred in the hydrothermal system. Based on the Th of inclusions trapped from boiling fluids and the CO2 contents of the inclusions, the hydrostatic pressure is estimated at 6.9-7.9 MPa. In the Tushihshan-Changjen group, the microthermometry of sulfur gas-bearing secondary two-phase fluid inclusions from hydrothermal quartz shows bimodal contents for a certain Th value, perhaps due to the intermittent incursion of brine at depth by phreatic or phreato-magmatic explosions. The presence of poly-phase (liquid + vapor + halite +/- sylvite I opaques) fluid inclusions with high Th (307 degrees C-484 degrees C) and high salinities (30-51 wt.% NaCl eq.) in one sample suggests a dense brine of probable magmatic derivation circulated in the Chinkuashih system. Halite-bearing inclusions which were homogenized by vapor disappearance coexisting with low-salinity vapor-rich inclusions in this sample may have been trapped in an immiscibility field at vapor-pressures from 7.5 to 21.5 MPa. Halite-bearing inclusions which were homogenized by halite dissolution after the vapor disappearance may have been trapped under even greater pressures, Fluid inclusion gas in samples were analyzed with a QMS. The results of bulk analyses indicate that these inclusions contain 99.45-99.67 mol% H2O, 0.27-0.52 mol% CO2, 0.015-0.066 mol% N-2, 0.0015-0.015 mol% CH4 and small amounts of SO, in three samples. These data suggest that the inclusion fluids are dominantly meteoric waters that interacted with host rocks and accumulated upward-fluxing magmatic volatiles, The fluid inclusion data indicate that the hydrothermal fluids related to the ore deposition of the high sulfidation Au-Cu deposits at Chinkuashih are characterized by the interaction of magmatic fluids with meteoric water under epithermal conditions.

2000.0,Chem. Geol.,Petrogenesis of two groups of pyroxenite from Tungchihsu Penghu Islands Taiwan Strait implications for mantle metasomatism beneath SE China,Ho K;Chen J;Smith A;Juang W,"Type II pyroxenite xenoliths are a common form of mantle material found in Miocene basaltic pyroclastic rocks at Tungchihsu in the Penghu Islands, Taiwan Strait. Two groups are identified from mineralogy, petrology and chemistry: Group I have mineral assemblages of clinopyroxene + amphibole (mosaic, generally kaersutite) +/- apatite +/- Ti-Fe oxide mineral +/- iron sulfide. These xenoliths are characterized by high abundances of large-ion lithophile elements (including Ba, K, Rb, Sr and Th), high field strength elements (Zr, Nb and Ti), and light rare-earth elements. Chemical compositions of this group of pyroxenite resemble those of Penghu alkali basalts. Likewise, the Sr-Nd isotopic compositions (Sr-87/Sr-86 = 0.70370-0.70385; Nd-143/Nd-144 = 0.51285-0.51295) of clinopyroxene, amphibole and apatite separates from this group falls within the field for late Cenozoic Penghu basaltic rocks and megacrysts, and it is suggested that this group of pyroxenite was formed by the crystallization of alkali basaltic magma in the upper mantle. The second group pyroxenites (group II) contain clinopyroxene, garnet, spinel, amphibole (interstitial, generally pargasite/hastingsite) and/or orthopyroxene and a Ti-Fe oxide mineral. They have low Na2O, K2O, TiO2, LREE, and high Al2O3 relative to group I pyroxenites, and compositionally are similar to tholeiitic picrites. From major- and trace elements evidence, we suggest that: the second group of pyroxenites may have formed by crystallization of tholeiitic picritic magmas under high pressure. Isotopic differences between clinopyroxene, amphibole and garnet or apatite separates from the two groups (group II: Sr-87/Sr-86 = 0.70460-0.70640; Nd-143/Nd-144 = 0.51269-0.51290) indicate the two groups of pyroxenite are not related. The coexisting mineral assemblages (clinopyroxene, amphibole and garnet) of group II pyroxenite are not in isotopic equilibrium suggesting that the minerals crystallised from different melt phases, possibly in a magma chamber undergoing fractionation and recharge or by progressive crystallisation in a vein system. The pyroxenite thus formed was then subsequently fragmented and/or re-cemented by a subsequent volatile bearing-melt that crystallised the interstitial amphibole. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

2001.0,Chem. Geol.,Geochemical and stable isotope studies on natural water in the Taroko Gorge karst area Taiwan chemical weathering of carbonate rocks by deep source CO2 and sulfuric acid,Yoshimura K;Nakao S;Noto M;Inokura Y;Urata K;Chen M;Lin P,"The geochemical cycle of CO2 and the hydrological cycle in the Taroko Gorge karst area, Taiwan, are discussed using chemical composition data of the natural water. together with stable isotope ratios of carbon and oxygen of the water and soil CO2. The soil CO2 concentration at a depth of 1 m showed seasonal variations with a maximum of 5.2% (v/v) and the minimum of 0.6% (v/v) at three different altitudes ranging from 50 to 2000 m asl. The soil temperature is the most important factor controlling the soil CO2 concentration in this area. The solubility of carbonates in groundwater can be explained by evolution under closed system conditions depending on the soil CO2 concentration measured. Unexpectedly, high delta C-13 values of HCO3- in groundwater were observed at some springs. There was also an equivalent relationship between the sum of the concentration of Mg2+ and Ca2+ ions and that of HCO3- and SO42- ions in their waters. These two facts suggest that some deep source CO2 and sulfuric acid derived from weathering of pyrite may take part in the chemical weathering of carbonate rocks (mainly calcareous schist) as well as the soil CO2. After the correction for the contribution of sulfuric acid, the delta C-13 values of HCO3- of groundwater issuing from some springs were still high, suggesting the presence of a deep source CO2 flux. Altitude isotope effects were observed for surface water and rainwater in this area and could be expressed as delta O-18 (parts per thousand) = - 0.0024h - 3.67 (h: altitude, m asl). The estimated altitudes of catchment basins of springs using this equation were over 1000-2000 m higher than those of springs. The rain falling high in the mountains is supplied with soil CO2, dissolves carbonate rocks under closed system conditions, penetrates deep underground, and comes out again from springs together with the deep source CO2 along fault crushing belts.

We report here mineral compositions, major and trace element and Sr/Nd isotope data of high-Mg basaltic andesites from the Mienhuayu, a volcanic islet formed at similar to 2.6 Ma in the central part of the NTVZ. The rocks are hypocrystalline, showing porphyritic texture with Ma-rich olivine (Fo = 81-80), bronzite (En = 82-79) and plagioclase (An 66-58) as major phenocryst phases. They have uniform whole-rock compositions, marked by high magnesium (MgO 5.9-8.1 wt.%, Mg value approximate to 0.6) relative to accompanying silica contents (SiO(2) = 52.8-54.5 wt.%). The high-Mg basaltic andesites contain the highest TiO(2)(similar to 1.5 wt.%) and lowest K(2)O (similar to 0.4 wt.%) among the NTVZ volcanic rocks. In the incompatible element variation diagram, these Mienhuayu magmas exhibit mild enrichments in large ion lithophile (LILE) and light rare earth elements (LREE), coupled with an apparent Pb-positive spike. They do not display depletions in high field strength elements (HFSE), a feature observed universally in the other NTVZ volcanics. The high-Mg basaltic andesites have rather unradiogenic Nd (epsilonNd = + 5.1-7.2) but apparently elevated Sr ((87)Sr/(86)Sr = 0.70435-0.70543; leached values) isotope ratios. Their overall geochemical and isotopic characteristics are similar to mid-Miocene ( similar to 13 Ma) high-Mg andesites from the Iriomote-jima, southern Ryukyus, Japan. Despite these magmas have lower LILE and LREE enrichments and Pb positive spike, their ""intraplate-type"" incompatible element variation patterns are comparable to those of extension-induced Miocene intraplate basalts emplaced in the Taiwan-Fujian region. Therefore, we interpret the Mienhuayu magmas as silica-saturated melts derived from decompression melting of the ascended asthenosphere that had been subtly affected by the adjacent Ryukyu subduction zone processes. This interpretation is consistent with the notion that in the northern Taiwan mountain belt post-orogenic lithospheric extension started in Plio-Pleistocene time. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The volcanic rocks consist predominantly of basanite, alkali olivine basalt, olivine tholeiite and quartz tholeiite with subordinate nephelinite and rare alkali picrite basalt. Twenty-four new ages of the basaltic rocks and amphibole megacryst determined by Ar-40-Ar-39 incremental heating experiments demonstrate that the basaltic lava erupted from 0.9 to 26.4 Ma. Although some basanite dikes and nephelinite pipes in Inner and Inner Middle belts of the Zhejiang area are early Miocene, almost all the late Cenozoic basaltic volcanism occurred following cessation of South China Sea seafloor spreading ( less than or equal to 16 Ma). Based on these results, most late Cenozoic intraplate magmatisin surrounding the South China Sea margins may be related to the migration of the South China Sea mid-ocean ridge system beneath SE China since mid-Miocene. However, in the Zhejiang-Fujian region, volcanic activities terminated gradually and propagated westward and northward due to the collision of the Luzon arc with the eastern edge of the Eurasia continent during late Miocene to Pleistocene. The Zhejiang-Fujian basalts exhibit trace element and isotopic affinities with OIB. Sr and Nd isotope compositions range from 0.703264 to 0.704235 and 0.512725 to 0.512961, respectively, similar to the composition of the Leiqiong basalts in South China. The enrichment of LREE coupled with depleted Sr-Nd isotopic compositions in the basaltic rocks imply that recent mantle metasomatism occurred shortly before the Cenozoic magmatism. The Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic compositions as well as high LILE/HFSE ratios found in some basaltic rocks showed that an EM2-type lead isotope signature existed in the continental lithospheric mantle in the Zhejiang-Fujian region. This character may have resulted from mantle metasomatism due to a paleo-subduction event. The Zhejiang-Fujian basaltic rocks were generated by partial melting and mixing of different proportions of depleted asthenospheric mantle (DMM or MORB) with EM2-type lithospheric mantle and have undergone different degree of fractional crystallization when the magma ascended to the surface.

2004.0,Chem. Geol.,Carbonsulfuriron relationships in sedimentary rocks from southwestern Taiwan influence of geochemical environment on greigite and pyrrhotite formation,Kao S;Horng C;Roberts A;Liu K,"The importance of the magnetic iron sulfide minerals, greigite (Fe3S4) and pyrrhotite (Fe7S8), is often underappreciated in geochemical studies because they are metastable with respect to pyrite (FeS2). Based on magnetic properties and X-ray diffraction analysis, previous studies have reported widespread occurrences of these magnetic minerals along with magnetite (Fe3O4) in two thick Plio-Pleistocene marine sedimentary sequences from southwestern Taiwan. Different stratigraphic zones were classified according to the dominant magnetic mineral assemblages (greigite-, pyrrhotite-, and magnetite-dominated zones). Greigite and pyrrhotite are intimately associated with fine-grained sediments, whereas magnetite is more abundant in coarse-grained sediments. We measured total organic carbon (TOC), total sulfur (TS), total iron (Fe-T) IN HCl extractable iron (Fe-A), and bulk sediment grain size for different stratigraphic zones in order to understand the factors governing the formation and preservation of the two magnetic iron sulfide minerals. The studied sediments have low TS/Fe-A weight ratios (0.03-0.2), far below that of pyrite (1.15), which indicates that an excess of reactive iron was available for pyritization. Observed low TS (0.05-0.27%) is attributed to the low organic carbon contents (TOC=0.25-0.55%), which resulted from dilution by rapid terrigenous sedimentation. The fine-grained sediments also have the highest Fe-T and Fe-A values. We suggest that under conditions of low organic carbon provision, the high iron activity in the fine-grained sediments may have removed reduced sulfur so effectively that pyritization was arrested or retarded, which, in turn, favored preservation of the intermediate magnetic iron sulfides. The relative abundances of reactive iron and labile organic carbon appear to have controlled the transformation pathway of amorphous FeS into greigite or into pyrrhotite. Compared to pyrrhotite-dominated sediments, greigite-dominated sediments are finer-grained and have higher Fe-A but lower TS. We suggest that diagenetic environments with higher supply of reactive iron, lower supply of labile organic matter, and, consequently, lower sulfide concentration result in relatively high Eh conditions, which favor formation of greigite relative to pyrrhotite.

2005.0,Chem. Geol.,Tideinfluenced acidic hydrothermal system offshore NE Taiwan,Chen C;Zeng Z;Kuo F;Yang T;Wang B;Tu Y,"Elemental sulfur and hydrogen sulfide emitted offshore of northeastern Taiwan known to local fishermen for generations, but never studied until recently, are found to have originated from a cluster of shallow (< 30 m depth) hydrothermal vents. Among the mounds is a massive 6 m high chimney with a diameter of 4 m at the base composed of almost pure sulfur and discharging hydrothermal fluid containing sulfur particles. The sulfur in the chimney has a delta(34)S= 1.1 parts per thousand that is isotopically lighter than seawater. A yellow smoker at shallow depths with such characteristics has never been reported on anywhere else in the world. Gas discharges from these vents are dominated by CO2 (> 92%) with small amounts of H2S. Helium isotopic ratios 7.5 times that of air indicate that these gases originate from the mantle. High temperature hydrothermal fluids have measured temperatures of 78-116 degrees C and pH (25 degrees C) values as low as 1.52, likely the lowest to be found in world records. Low temperature vents (30-65 degrees C) have higher pH values. Continuous temperature records from one vent show a close correlation with diumal tides, suggesting rapid circulation of the hydrothermal fluids. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

2006.0,Chem. Geol.,Thermal event records in SE China coastal areas Constraints from monazite ages of beach sands from two sides of the Taiwan strait,Chen C;Lu H;Lin W;Lee C,"CHIME ages of > 460 detrital monazites from beach sands from SE China (Chinmen Island) and W Taiwan were determined in order to deduce the major tectonothermal events affecting the coastal areas of SE China. Additional 360 monazites from estuarine sediments of the Minjiang River (eastern China), metamorphic rocks from Chinmen Island and sedimentary rocks from W Taiwan were also dated. Ages of the Chinmen beach monazites (245-80Ma) reveal that they are derived from adjacent gneisses and mixed with sediment from the Jiulongjiang River (SE China). Some large, euhedral monazites contain older cores (similar to 220Ma) and younger rims (137-124Ma), demonstrating that overgrowth on inherited Indosinian grains occurred at the time of gneiss formation (137Ma). Monazites of W Taiwan fall into two age groups, one in the Paleoproterozoic (1900-1650Ma) and the other spanning the Phanerozoic (530-120Ma). Based on similar ages of Phanerozoic monazites from the Minjiang River and W Taiwan, monazites of the latter group are inferred to be derived mainly from this river, hence the Paleoproterozoic monazites are most probably derived from Cathaysia basement exposed in the drainage basin of the Wuyishan (NW Fujian). Along with monazite ages of the two-mica schist, sediments from the uplifted Changle-Nanao shear zone (CNSZ) constitute only a minor component of deposits in W Taiwan. The age frequency distribution of Phanerozoic monazites from W Taiwan, which shows peaks at 450-430, 360-350, similar to 275 and similar to 245Ma suggests the existence of Caledonian, Hercynian and Indosinian crust beneath the immense Yanshanian cover of the SE China coastal area.

2007.0,Chem. Geol.,High precision measurements of MgCa and SrCa ratios in carbonates by cold plasma inductively coupled plasma quadrupole mass spectrometry,Shen C;Chiu H;Chiang H;Chu M;Wei K;Steinke S;Chen M;Lin Y;Lo L,"We present a new high precision analytical method for the determination of Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios in carbonates using an inductively coupled plasma quadrupole mass spectrometer (ICP-QMS) with a 650-W cold plasma technique and a desolvation introduction system. Signal intensities are detected in pulse-counting mode and Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios are calculated directly from intensity ratios of Mg-24/Ca-43 and Sr-86/Ca-43 using external matrix-matched standards for every 4-5 samples to correct for instrumental mass discrimination and low-frequency ratio drift. Significant matrix effect of Ca content on Mg/Ca determination (-0.018 Mg/Ca (mmol/mol)/[Ca] (ppm)), can be overcome by diluting [Ca] to 6-8 ppm in the sample solution or using an empirical correction. The Sr/Ca ratio affects the Mg/Ca determination, with a factor of -0.32% Mg/Ca per mmol/mol. This is mainly caused by the influence of doubly charged Sr-86, which biases the intensity measurement of the Ca-43(+) ion beam. This effect results in a trivial offset of less than 0.1% on Mg/Ca measurements for Quatemary foraminiferal and coral samples. The internal precision of our method ranges from 0.1 to 0.2%. Replicate measurements made on standards and samples show long-term external uncertainties (2 sigma) of Mg/Ca=0.84% and Sr/Ca=0.49%. The minimum sample size requirement is only 3.5 mu g of carbonate. The application of this newly developed technique on the planktonic foraminifera Globigerinoides ruber from a core recovered in the southern South China Sea yields a glacial-interglacial difference in sea surface temperature (SST) of 3 degrees C. Three-year coral Sr/Ca data suggest that the seasonal SST ranged from 22.6-23.8 degrees C in winter to 26.9-27.9 degrees C in summer in Nanwan, south Taiwan, during 2000-2002. The coral-Sr/Ca inferred SSTs in 2002 match well with instrumental records, which demonstrates the validity of this ICP-QMS method. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

2009.0,Chem. Geol.,Geochemical Applications of Noble Gases,Yang T;Marty B;Hilton D;Kurz M,"Noble gases are unique tracers, due to their rarity on Earth and their inertness. Several of their isotopes are produced by nuclear reactions, whereas others were trapped when the Earth formed. They have been widely used for understanding the evolution and structure of the Earth, dating geological events/processes, characterizing magma genesis and volcanism in different tectonic environments, tracing mantle-crust interaction even in non-volcanic areas, and for monitoring earthquake and volcanic activities. Some of these topics were presented at the 9th International Conferences on Gas Geochemistry that was held in 2007 in Taipei, Taiwan. This special volume includes twelve papers, which cover a wide range of applications of noble gases geochemistry such as tracing the thermal evolution of the early Earth, understanding the mantle source of continental basalts, establishing the spatial variations of gas compositions in hot springs and fumaroles from volcanic and forearc areas, as well as in key non-volcanic areas such as faults and seismic zones, tracing the origin and evolution of ore-forming. uids of uranium deposits, reproducing the noble gas behavior during faulting, and, finally, using argon as a tracer of large-scale geologic processes.

Chemically it is a normal, medium-K calc-alkaline andesite. SHRIMP dating of magmatic zircons yielded an emplacement Pb-206/U-238 age of 1.04 +/- 0.06 Ma with epsilon(Hf)(t) of 6.1 to 13.4 and 6180 of 5.02 to 6.28 parts per thousand. The zircons contain inherited cores and felsic to andesitic silicate-melt (glass) inclusions besides apatite, quartz, K-feldspar, biotite, garnet. Fe-Mg minerals (pyroxene or hornblende) and plagioclase with variable An values. Plagioclase phenocrysts also contain quartz. K-feldspar and felsic melt inclusions. This study confirms the presence of micro-scale heterogeneity in the andesite as a result of mixing between mantle-derived and continental material. Contamination of continental crust occurs either within the magma chamber at a medium to deep crustal level and/or during dehydration and melting of a subducted oceanic slab and overlying sediments in an island-arc environment.

2016.0,Chem. Geol.,Claymineral compositions of sediments in the Gaoping RiverSea system Implications for weathering sedimentary routing and carbon cycling,Wang Y;Fan D;Liu J;Chang Y,"Small mountainous rivers (SMRs) play a crucial role in the global sediment and carbon cycle by rapid transfer of huge particulate and dissolved loads into the sea. Gaoping river-sea system is a good representative of SMRs in Oceania, having an extreme high denudation rate (15,000 t km(-2) yr(-1)) and a high burial efficiency of terrestrial particulate organic carbon (POC) in the Gaoping submarine canyon (GPSC). However, it is contentious whether silicate weathering or POC burial plays more important role in long-term carbon cycling in such a high active orogen. Clay minerals of fluvial sediments not only act as an important carrier of POC, but also encode valuable information of weathering regimes on land and dispersal routes in the seas. To uncover these informations, surface and core sediments are systematically collected from the Gaoping river-sea system for clay-mineral analysis. Comparative studies are carried out on the basis of new results and vast published data to better understand weathering processes and products in Oceanian islands and Southeast Asian continent. We find that clay-mineral compositions in the Gaoping River (GPR) and other Taiwan rivers are a legacy from provenance rocks in the alpine reach, characterized by predominant illite and chlorite and limited compositional change throughout the river courses. These sharply contradict the downstream increase in compositional complexity (rich in kaolinite and smectite) and chemical weathering intensity in Southeast Asian large rivers because of strong hydrolysis and active sediment recycling at the lowland reach with extensive floodplains. High consistency of clay-mineral compositions is also observed in the interior and exterior of GPSC. Careful examination shows that a slight offshore decrease in cumulative illite and chlorite content is accompanied by a slight increase in exotic clay-mineral inputs by ocean circulations. The combination of this finding with previously reported data on the offshore change in delta C-13(org) and Delta C-14(org) values suggests that petrogenic POC predominates in the river-dominated Gaoping continental margin with high preservation efficiency due to its tight bandage with clay minerals. Moreover, a tardy response of chemical weathering fluxes to high elevated physical erosion rates is remarkably examined in the Oceanian and global river gauging data. We therefore postulate that rapid transfer and high burial efficiency of terrestrial POC in the tectonically active high-standing islands and their adjacent continental margins play much more important role in the long-term carbon cycle than silicate weathering.

2017.0,Chem. Geol.,Exploring the relationship between soil degassing and seismic activity by continuous radon monitoring in the Longitudinal Valley of eastern Taiwan,Fu C;Yang T;Tsai C;Lee L;Liu T;Walia V;Chen C;Chang W;Kumar A;Lai T,"Donghua (DH) continuous soil gas monitoring station is located on the suture zone in eastern Taiwan. The variations in radon concentration are synchronized to variations in carbon dioxide (CO2), which is considered as the companion gas for radon (Rn). Results reveal that semi-diurnal variation of soil-gas, probably generated by the solar tide effect, achieve values of similar to 500 Bq/m(3) for Rn and 0.4% for CO2. The variations exceeding the threshold by statistical analysis can be used to identify events associated with geodynamic processes such as earthquakes. A significant increase in soil-gas concentrations was recorded 2 months before the Rueisuei earthquake (M-L = 6.4, October 31, 2013) and recurrent anomalies were observed 3 weeks before the Fanglin earthquake (M-L = 5.9, May 21, 2014). Both earthquakes occurred in the Longitudinal Valley area of eastern Taiwan. This study suggests that longer periods of soil gas anomalies are positively correlated with impending earthquake of larger magnitude. From the high precision GPS data showed an appreciable decrease in extension rate was also observed approximately 4 months before the Rueisuei earthquake. It is worthy to have a continuous monitoring on multiple parameters (soil radon, carbon dioxide, atmospheric pressure, humidity, temperature and precipitation) at DH station. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

2017.0,Chem. Geol.,Geochemical characteristics of soil radon and carbon dioxide within the Dead Sea Fault and Karasu Fault in the Amik Basin Hatay Turkey,Yuce G;Fu C;D'Alessandro W;Gulbay A;Lai C;Bellomo S;Yang T;Italiano F;Walia V,"The study area is close to the boundary of three tectonic plates (Anatolian, Arabian, and African plates) and is characterized by important tectonic lineaments, which consist mainly of the Dead Sea Fault (DSF), the Karasu Fault, and the East Anatolian Fault (EAF) systems. To understand the origin of soil gas emanation and its relationships with the tectonics of the Amik Basin (Hatay), a detailed soil gas sampling was systematically performed. Together with CO2 flux measurements, > 220 soil gas samples were analyzed for Rn and CO2 concentrations. The distribution of soil Rn (kBq/m(3)), CO2 concentration (ppm), and CO2 flux (g/m(2)/day) in the area appears as a point source (spot) and/or diffuses (halo) anomalies along the buried faults/fractures due to crustal leaks. The results revealed that Rn and CO2 concentrations in the soil gas show anomalous values at the specific positions in the Amik Basin. The trace of these anomalous values is coincident with the N-S trending DSF. CO2 is believed to act as a carrier for Rn gas. Based on the Rn and CO2 concentrations of soil gases, at least three gas components are required to explain the observed variations. In addition to the atmospheric component, two other gas sources can be recognized. One is the deep crust component, which exhibits high Rn and CO2 concentrations, and is considered the best indicator for the surface location of fault/fracture zones in the region. The other component is a shallower gas source with high Rn concentration and low CO2 concentration. Moreover, He isotopic compositions of representative samples vary from 0.94 to 0.99 Ra, illustrating that most samples have a soil air component and may have mixed with some crustal component, without significant input of the mantle component. Based on the repeated measurements at a few sites, soil gas concentrations at the same site were observed to be higher in 2014 than in 2013, which may be associated with the activity of the DSF in 2013-2014. This suggests that soil gas variations at fault zone are closely related to the local crustal stress, and hence are suitable for monitoring fault activities. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

2019.0,Chem. Geol.,The redistribution of B concentration and its isotopes during lowgrade metamorphism Observations in metapelites from the Central Range Taiwan,Pi J;You C;Horng C;Yang H;Chen C,"The Plio-Pleistocene orogeny resulted in the exhumation of a regional metamorphic belt, comprising low- to high-grade metapelites in the Central Range, Taiwan. In this study, we analyze the distributions of B isotopes along a prograde metamorphic profile (argillite to greenschist) in the western Central Range to constrain the effects of metamorphic fluids generated during dehydration on the redistribution of the mobile elements. From west to east, peak metamorphic temperatures increase from similar to 200 degrees C to 320 degrees C. B concentrations and delta B-11 values generally decrease to the east with similar to 50% loss of B, and the delta B-11 values roughly decrease from -5% to -15%. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis results of these mineral compositions, except for calcite, show no correlation with B contents and delta B-11. And the mixing monitoring of mineralogical compositions cannot account for the observed B contents and delta B-11 coherent and W-E distribution trend. As the B isotopes may be fractionated between rock and fluid during dehydration, a Rayleigh distillation equation was applied into a model under similar conditions. The results indicate that the measured delta B-11 values are consistent with the modeled equilibrium of fluid-rock B isotope fractionation within the constrained temperature ranges, thereby supporting the hypothesis that dehydration processes act as a major control on the distribution of B isotopes in the low-grade metapelites. This model also estimates a delta B-11 value of 5.8% for the integrated expelled fluids when getting totally 50% loss of B. Any B sequestering by tourmalines in meta-sediment is an important factor to retain B to a greater depth in subducting slabs. However, our results suggest this factor is not significant for the low-grade metapelites. This study constrains the effect of dehydration on B flux and B isotope distributions during lowgrade metamorphism and how the heterogenetic mineralogical compositions may affect its variations, and may contribute to a better understanding of B mass cycling in subduction environments.","Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Chiayi, Taiwan.;  Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Earth Sci, 1 Univ Rd, Tainan 701, Taiwan.;  Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Earth Dynam Syst Res Ctr, Tainan, Taiwan.;  Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Natl Museum Nat Sci, Taichung, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,5,1.0,1.0,"You, CF (corresponding author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Earth Sci, 1 Univ Rd, Tainan 701, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and Technology, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 106-2116-M-006-015]","The authors would like to acknowledge the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan for funding the research, MOST 106-2116-M-006-015 to CFY.",Boron isotopes; Dehydration; Metapelite; Low-grade metamorphism; Metamorphic fluids,10.1016/j.chemgeo.2019.05.007,Article,BORON ISOTOPE; FRACTIONATION; ROCKS; GEOCHEMISTRY; SEDIMENTS; FLUID; CONSTRAINTS; TOURMALINES; SYSTEMATICS; LITHIUM,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,CHEMICAL GEOLOGY,1,520,ISI,NATL CHUNG CHENG UNIV;NATL CHENG KUNG UNIV;NATL CHENG KUNG UNIV;INST EARTH SCI;NATL MUSEUM NAT SCI,NATL CHENG KUNG UNIV,B2
2014.0,Clim. Past.,Late Holocene environmental reconstructions and their implications on flood events typhoon and agricultural activities in NE Taiwan,Wang L;Behling H;Lee T;Li H;Huh C;Shiau L;Chang Y,"We reconstructed paleoenvironmental changes from a sediment archive of a lake in the floodplain of the Ilan Plain of NE Taiwan on multi-decadal resolution for the last ca. 1900 years. On the basis of pollen and diatom records, we evaluated past floods, typhoons, and agricultural activities in this area which are sensitive to the hydrological conditions in the western Pacific. Considering the high sedimentation rates with low microfossil preservations in our sedimentary record, multiple flood events were. identified during the period AD 100-1400. During the Little Ice Age phase 1 (LIA 1 - AD 1400-1620), the abundant occurrences of wetland plant (Cyperaceae) and diatom frustules imply less flood events under stable climate conditions in this period. Between AD 500 and 700 and the Little Ice Age phase 2 (LIA 2 - AD 1630-1850), the frequent typhoons were inferred by coarse sediments and planktonic diatoms, which represented more dynamical climate conditions than in the LIA 1. By comparing our results with the reconstructed changes in tropical hydrological conditions, we suggested that the local hydrology in NE Taiwan is strongly influenced by typhoon-triggered heavy rainfalls, which could be influenced by the variation of global temperature, the expansion of the Pacific warm pool, and the intensification of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events.","Univ Gottingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, Dept Palynol & Climate Dynam, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.;  Natl Taiwan Museum, Collect Management Dept, Taipei 100, Taiwan.;  Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei 128, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei 106, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Inst Appl Geosci, Keelung 202, Taiwan.;  Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Oceanog, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.;",GERMANY;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,GERMANY,GERMANY,7,2.0,1.0,"Wang, LC (corresponding author), Univ Gottingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, Dept Palynol & Climate Dynam, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.","National Science CouncilMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [NSC 100-2611-M-110-011-, NSC 101-2116-M-002-007-, NSC 101-2611-M-110-003-, NSC 102-2917-I-564-058, MOST 103-2811-M-194-010]; Open Fund of Key Laboratory of Chinese Academy of Geological SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [KERDC201301]; Asia-Pacific Ocean Research Center located in National Sun Yat-sen University, Taiwan; Interchange Association, JapanInterchange Association, Japan","We thank Masanobu Yamamoto (Hokkaido University) and two anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments.

2019.0,Clim. Past.,Chinas historical record when searching for tropical cyclones corresponding to Intertropical Convergence Zone ITCZ shifts over the past 2 kyr,Chen H;Liu Y;Chiang C;Liu X;Chou Y;Pan H,"The northwestern Pacific Ocean and South China Sea are where tropical cyclones occur most frequently. Many climatologists also study the formation of Pacific Ocean warm pools and typhoons in this region. This study collected data of paleotyphoons found in China's official historical records over the past 2000 years that contained known typhoon activity reports. The collected data are then subjected to statistical analyses focusing on typhoon activity in coastal regions of southeastern China to garner a better understanding of the long-term evolution of moving paths and occurrence frequency, especially regarding those typhoons making landfall in mainland China. We analyzed the data with the year and month of each typhoon event, as well as the number of events in a 10-year period. The result shows that (1) north-southward migration of typhoon paths corresponds to the north-southward migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) during the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and Little Ice Age (LIA) and (2) paleotyphoons made landfall in mainland China 1 month earlier during the MWP than during the LIA. This implies a northward shift in ITCZ during the MWP. Typhoons tend to make landfall in Japan during El Nino-like periods and strike the southern coastal regions of China during La Nina-like stages. According to paleo-typhoon records over the last 2000 years, typhoons made landfall in southeastern China frequently around 490-510, 700-850, and after 1500 CE The number of typhoons striking Guangdong Province peaked during the coldest period in 1660-1680 CE; however, after 1700 CE, landfall has migrated farther north. The track of tropical cyclones (TCs) in the northwestern Pacific Ocean is affected by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), which shows a nearly 30-year and a 60-year cycle during the LIA.","Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Inst Earth Sci, Keelung, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Ctr Excellence Oceans, Keelung, Taiwan.;  Capital Normal Univ, Coll Environm Resources & Tourism, Beijing, Peoples R China.;  Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ocean Sci & Engn, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;CHINA;CHINA,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,6,1.0,,"Chen, HF (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Inst Earth Sci, Keelung, Taiwan.; Chen, HF (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Ctr Excellence Oceans, Keelung, Taiwan.","National Taiwan Ocean University [NSC103-2116-M-019-003, NSC106-2116-M-019-004]; National Science Council of TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","This study was supported by the National Taiwan Ocean University and grants NSC103-2116-M-019-003 and NSC106-2116-M-019-004 from the National Science Council of Taiwan.

2018.0,Dendrochronologia,A dry season streamflow reconstruction of the critically endangered Formosan landlocked salmon habitat,Guan B;Wright W;Chiang L;Cook E,"This study presents a 259-year (1750-2008 CE) reconstruction for October to February (ONDJF) standardized streamflow index of the Chichiawan Stream, the sole habitat of the critically endangered Formosan landlocked salmon (Oncorhynchus formosanus) remaining natural population. The reconstruction was based on the earlywood ring-width variations of Taiwan Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga wilsoniana), using ensemble empirical mode decomposition for chronology development. Results showed that a higher average ONDJF streamflow in the 1968-2008 period was positively associated with a wider Taiwan Douglas-fir earlywood ring. During that period, the average ONDJF streamflow was related to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and El Nino-Southern Oscillation development. Spectral analysis indicated that the reconstructed index had significant peaks around 2 similar to 7 years and less significant peaks around 20-35 years. Based on the derived and reconstructed indices, most of the average ONDJF streamflow between 1750 and 2008 was within the normal range. Furthermore, there was no statistical evidence to suggest that the flow regime of the last few decades had changed, which refuted the speculation that the dry season streamflow natural variability in the 1960s and 1970s might have contributed toward the critically endangered status of Formosan landlocked salmon. The results of this study will be useful for developing short- to mid-term strategies to protect the endangered species and manage water resources.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Sch Forestry & Resource Conservat, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.;  Univ Arizona, Lab Tree Ring Res, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.;  Taiwan Forestry Bur, Hsinchu 30046, Taiwan.;  Columbia Univ, Tree Ring Lab, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA.;",TAIWAN;USA;TAIWAN;USA,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,4,1.0,,"Guan, BT (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Sch Forestry & Resource Conservat, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, ROCMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST102-2628-B-002-013-MY3, MOST101-2313-B-002-015-MY3]","We thank Shei-Pa National Park, Taroko National Park, Veteran Forest Conservation Agency, and Taiwan Forestry Bureau for permissions to conduct field sampling.

The taste and odor problems were probably cased by the metabolites of algae or other microorganisms as the raw water came from an eutrophicated lake. The conventional treatment processes with prechlorination currently employed in the full-scale plant were unable to completely remove them. Three treatment process trains were compared side by side in the pilot testing: a conventional process without prechlorination (Process 1), conventional process plus ozone, GAC, and pellet softening (Process 2), and integrated membrane process (UF plus NF) followed by the conventional process. Results show that membrane process produced water with the best quality measured by turbidity, dissolved organics, biostability or organoleptic parameters. The second best was Process 2, which produced water with high biostability and aesthetic quality.

2005.0,Desalination,An overview of arsenic removal by pressuredriven membrane processes,Shih M,"Management of hazardous wastes, such as arsenic, is one of major public concern. Arsenic is a naturally occurring metalloid, which is widely distributed in nature. Recently, arsenic in drinking water attracted attention because some of the drinking water resources contain considerable concentrations of arsenic which cause acute and chronic symptoms in many countries, especially in Bangladesh, China, Mongolia, and Taiwan. In 2001, the USEPA promulgated a rule lowering the arsenic MCL from 5 mugL(-1) to 10 mugL(-1). This paper offers an overview of geochemistry, distribution, sources, regulations, acute and chronic symptoms, and applications of membrane technologies in the water treatment research that have already been realized or that are suggested on the basis of bench or lab scale research. These membrane technologies include RO, NF, UF, and MF. Most of theses applications have proven to be reliable in removing arsenic from water. The possible influence of some source water parameters, membrane material, membrane types, membrane processes on arsenic removal efficiency by membrane technologies are also explored. This review paper also offers data relating to regulations of arsenic standard, acute and chronic symptoms that are caused by the exposure of arsenic to explain why water treatments need to use the membrane technology to meet the MCL standard.","I Shou Univ, Dept Biol Sci & Technol, Kaohsiung 840, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,1,1.0,,"Shih, MC (corresponding author), I Shou Univ, Dept Biol Sci & Technol, 1,Sect,1 Hsueh Cheng Rd,Ta Hsu Hsiang, Kaohsiung 840, Taiwan.",,,arsenic; characterization; distribution; toxicity; arsenic regulations; membrane technologies; RO; NF; UF; MF,10.1016/j.desal.2004.07.031,Article,DRINKING-WATER; CANCER RISK; SKIN-CANCER; GROUNDWATER; NANOFILTRATION; HEALTH; LYMPHOCYTES; METHYLATION; PREVALENCE; ADSORPTION,ELSEVIER,DESALINATION,196,172,ISI,I SHOU UNIV,I SHOU UNIV,A
2005.0,Desalination,Evaluation of wastewater reclamation processes in a hightech industrial park,Chuang S;Chang T;You S;Ouyang C,"The objectives of this research were to evaluate two different processes using for wastewater reclamation in a high-tech industrial park area in Taiwan.

The second DAF-AC-RO system was comprised of coagulation/flocculation, dissolved air flotation (DAF), an activated carbon bed, microfiltration module and reverse osmosis membrane units. This study was carried out at a pilot-scale plant in situ that operated for approximately 1 year. According to the long-term experimental results, both the AC-RO-IE and the DAF-AC-RO processes illustrated excellent performances on inorganic and organic contaminant removal. Comparing the removal efficiency of the filtration-AC units in the AC-RO-IE system with the coagulation-DAF-AC units in the DAF-AC-RO system, the removal efficiency of TDS, SiO2 and COD increased by 19.8%, 70.1% and 44.4% in the latter system, respectively. In addition, the combination of PAC-coagulation and DAF units could improve hardness removal, modify the form of dissolved silica, and reduce the SDI and MFI values.

2005.0,Desalination,The membrane application on the wastewater reclamation and reuse from the effluent of industrial WWTP in northern Taiwan,Chen H;Yeh H;Shiau S,"This is the first full scope study of wastewater reclamation and reuse on public WWTP in Taiwan, A 50 m(3)/day pilot plant with membrane and,biological systems of wastewater reclamation has been deployed and operated in the WWTP of Hsinchu Industrial Park, northern Taiwan. The reclaimed water has been transported to five factories and been used as the fresh water supply as well as the makeup water of cooling tower. The future construction of a 10,000 m(3)/day wastewater reclamation plant has been proposed and finiancially investigated. The business plan of BTO is proposed for future development, The 50 m(3)/day pilot plant consists of a membrane UF/RO system followed by the systems of high efficient biological oxidation systems BioNET and/or BAC. The bench-scale-membrane scaling/fouling test and magnetic anti-scaling system are also introduced to verify the mechanisms of membrane scaling and fouling. The result of the pilot study shows that the reclaimed water can conform the drinking water standard and can be used as the make-up water of cooling tower as well as the manufacturing water of many industrial. applications. The concentrate of RO process can fit the effluent standard and can be discharged directly to the river nearby., There are 88.6% of the factories in the industrial park express their willingness of using reclaimed water and 4600 m(3)/day is requested after the preliminary poll. The cost of reclaimed water is around US$0.54/m(3) (including construction, O & M and transportation) which is higher than the tariff of tap water (US$0.27/m(3)) but lower than the cost of seawater desalination as well as that of reservoir construction.

Some of this wastewater contains volatile residual monomers, such as acrylonitfile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) manufacturing wastewater. Because of the high volatility of the acrylonitrile monomer, this chemical will be partly removed from the aeration system by the air stripping effect. An empirical model was developed for evaluating BOD removal by air stripping and biodegradation when the wastewater was treated in an aerobic submerged membrane bioreactor (ASMBR). The results showed that the removal of BOD from ABS wastewater by air stripping was in the range of 2-10%. These results also showed that the estimation of contribution of air stripping and biodegradation in the BOD removal in the MBR is very important in the optimum design of the MBR for ABS wastewater.","Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Engn, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.; Chia Nan Univ Pharm & Sci, Dept Environm Engn & Sci, Tainan 717, Taiwan.;",AUSTRALIA;TAIWAN,AUSTRALIA,AUSTRALIA,5,2.0,,"Vigneswaran, S (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Engn, City Campus,Level 6,Bldg 2,POB 123, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.",,,acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene wastewater; aerobic submerged membrane bioreactor; air stripping; biodegradation; empirical modeling,10.1016/j.desal.2005.08.014,Article; Proceedings Paper,,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,DESALINATION,18,191,ISI,UNIV TECHNOL SYDNEY;CHIA NAN UNIV PHARM AND SCI,UNIV TECHNOL SYDNEY,A

During the 140 days of operation, manual cleaning was carried Out twice and chemical cleaning was carried out once, A natural logarithmic evolution of the viscosity with TSS concentration was observed. The results of SEM and EDX demonstrated that the fouling on the membrane outer surface was mainly due to microorganisms and/or the sludge physiological properties. The results indicated that the MBR system has potential as a means of treating high-strength and fluctuating strength wastewater with consistent performance.","Chia Nan Univ Pharm & Sci, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Tainan 717, Taiwan.;  Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Engn, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.;",TAIWAN;AUSTRALIA,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,4,1.0,,"Chang, CY (corresponding author), Chia Nan Univ Pharm & Sci, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Tainan 717, Taiwan.",,,Membrane bioreactor; Pharmaceutical wastewater; Viscosity; Scanning electron microscope,10.1016/j.desal.2007.09.109,Article; Proceedings Paper,ACTIVATED-SLUDGE PROCESS; LIQUID SEPARATION; REMOVAL; CHEMISTRY; SOLIDS; METALS,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,DESALINATION,45,234,ISI,CHIA NAN UNIV PHARM AND SCI;UNIV TECHNOL SYDNEY,CHIA NAN UNIV PHARM AND SCI,A
2008.0,Desalination,Removal of arsenic from groundwater by electroultrafiltration,Hsieh L;Weng Y;Huang C;Li K,"The objective of this study was to examine the removal of arsenic from groundwater by a laboratory scale electro-ultrafiltration (EUF) system. Two groundwater samples taken from I-Ian County located in the northeastern part of Taiwan were Studied. These well waters were selected based on their As(III) and As(V) contents; the As(III) to As(V) ratios of the well water were 1.8 and 0.4 for Well-#1 and Well-#2, respectively. In the absence of electrical voltage, the total arsenic removal efficiencies were 1% and 14% for Well-#1 and Well-#2 samples, respectively, using 100-kDa membranes. The higher As removal efficiency of Well-#2 than that of Well-#1 sample might be attributed to different charge characteristics of As(V) and As(III). Upon the application of an electrical voltage of 25 V to the Ultrafiltration (UF) system, it was able to reduce the total arsenic concentrations in both groundwater samples by over 79%. The result suggested the possible association between As(III) species and dissolved organic matter which enhanced the As removal.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Grad Inst Environm Engn, Taipei 106, Taiwan.;  CECI Engn Consultants Inc, Taipei 106, Taiwan.;  Atom Energy Council, Inst Nucl Energy Res, Tao Yuan 325, Taiwan.;  Univ Delaware, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Newark, DE 19716 USA.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;USA,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,4,1.0,,"Li, KC (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Grad Inst Environm Engn, Taipei 106, Taiwan.",,,Electro-ultrafiltration (EUF); As(III); As(V),10.1016/j.desal.2007.09.110,Article; Proceedings Paper,ELECTRO-MICROFILTRATION; DRINKING-WATER; MEMBRANE; NANOFILTRATION; SUSPENSIONS; PRESSURE,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,DESALINATION,24,234,ISI,NATL TAIWAN UNIV;INST NUCL ENERGY RES;UNIV DELAWARE,NATL TAIWAN UNIV,A
2008.0,Desalination,The optimal allocating pumping rate of a multiwell system for a brackish water desalination plant,Hsui C,"I applied perspectives on operations research (OR) to propose a non-linear mathematical model, termed the APWs (allocation of pumping wells) model, to address problems associated with allocating pumping rates of a multi-well system for a brackish water reverse osmosis (BWRO) plant. In some and and inshore regions, feed water mostly preferred to exploit groundwater, owing to its easier desalted characteristic than seawater. However, the operations of most multi-well systems are always arbitrary, and we could not guarantee the strategies of operation might be optimal; additionally, the pumping quantity and quality variation of each well would all induce the unstable quality of feed water, and then lead to the problem of scaling. Though adding acid could treat the problem of scaling, the acidification, on the other hand, means the increasing cost and damage risk of a reverse osmosis (RO) system. Therefore, the overriding objective of this study is to decide the optimal allocating pumping rate among wells for a RO system on the premise of no acid added and under finite groundwater resources, to ensure feed water has no scaling potential and achieve marginal usage of groundwater resources. The APWs model tries to integrate engineering and management aspects to replace subjective operation of a multi-well system. Here, I apply scaling intensity (SI) proposed by literature that considered calcium carbonate (CaCO3), calcium sulfate (CaSO4) and silica (SiO2) as mainly potential scaling compounds in feed water to assess the scaling potential of a RO system. Besides, I present a solving algorithm for achieving the maximal SI with no scaling occurred. Moreover, I apply the proposed model to a case study in Taiwan by considering four-well system, to obtain optimal allocation with retaining the cleanest residual storage of whole groundwater resources, to avoid the waste of water resources. The results shown that through the assistance of OR technique, it could provide helpful information indeed in RO feed water management. In a word, the APWs model proposed in this paper not only could provide referenced guidelines for all RO operators all over the world, but also allow engineers to gain new insights into their field by integrating different disciplines.","Nanhua Univ, Grad Inst Management Sci, Chiayi 622, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,1,1.0,,"Hsui, CY (corresponding author), Nanhua Univ, Grad Inst Management Sci, Chiayi 622, Taiwan.",,,scaling; non-linear programming; water resources management; operations research; BWRO,10.1016/j.desal.2007.01.078,Article; Proceedings Paper,GROUNDWATER,ELSEVIER,DESALINATION,4,221,ISI,NANHUA UNIV,NANHUA UNIV,A

The extrusion method and sol-gel/slip-casting method were employed for fabricating the membrane layer of TiO2 inside of the tubular substrate of Al2O3. A process of firing followed. Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffractometry, permporometry, and molecular weight cut-off determinations have verified the prepared tubular products were indeed inside-out tubular TiO2/Al2O3 composite membranes Suitable for ultrafiltration applications. Experimental results of electrofiltration have shown that the prepared tubular TiO2/Al2O3 composite membranes are capable of removing a great extent of water quality criteria of concern from the target wastewater to yield permeate with a turbidity of lower than 0.75 NTU. Permeate thus obtained could be used for make-up water of cooling towers and other purposes.","Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Inst Environm Engn, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,,"Yang, GCC (corresponding author), Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Inst Environm Engn, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.",,,Tubular composite membrane; Preparation; Characterization; Electrofiltration; CMP wastewater,10.1016/j.desal.2007.09.104,Article; Proceedings Paper,MICROFILTRATION; FILTRATION; REJECTION,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,DESALINATION,17,234,ISI,NATL SUN YAT SEN UNIV,NATL SUN YAT SEN UNIV,A
2008.0,Desalination,Using combined membrane processes for textile dyeing wastewater reclamation,You S;Tseng D;Deng J,"In this study, the performance of sequencing batch reactor (SBR), aerobic membrane bioreactor (AMBR), anaerobic-oxic membrane bioreactor (AOMBR) and AOMBR/RO processes treating the synthetic textile dyeing wastewater (Reactive Black 5) was investigated and compared. After more than 2 year process operation, the average SS concentration for SBR, AMBR, AOMBR, and AOMBR/RO process effluent were 96, 0, 0, and 0 mg L-1, respectively. Furthermore, the COD of the above effluent were 133, 95, 37, and 38 mg L-1, respectively. It was found that the anaerobic tank of AOMBR and AOMBR/RO can lower the COD concentration. In addition, the BOD of the above effluent were 68, 3, 3 and 0 mg L-1, respectively. For this parameter, the membrane unit also showed an excellent performance. Finally, the true color of the above effluent were 548, 513, 196 and 32 ADMI, respectively, revealed that the anaerobic tank and RO unit could achieve higher color removal performance. This revealed that the processes containing membrane unit performed excellent efficiencies on SS and BOD removal. Additionally, the anaerobic tank can enhance the COD and true color removal, while the RO unit can further remove the true color. According the experiment result, all the processes containing membrane unit meet the Taiwan EPA effluent criteria, but Only the AOMBR/RO process meets the water reclamation criteria for toilet flushing, landscaping, irrigation, sprinkling, and cooling water usage. This study also isolated higher decolorized performance microrganisms by using TGE, PDA and TGC mediums. Only 3 isolates performed more than 90% Reactive Black 5 degrading efficiencies by using both TGE and aerobic PDA mediums. On the contrary, no isolate was obtained by using anaerobic PDA mediums, implied that there is no strictly anaerobic fungi in the anaerobic tank. Furthermore, 18 isolates Cultured from anaerobic TGC medium showed more than 90% Reactive Black 5rernoval efficiency, revealed that the anaerobic tank did enhance the growth of the high decolorized microorganisms, especially anaerobic bacteria.","Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Dept Bioenvironm Engn, Chungli 320, Taiwan.;  Chung Yuan Christian Univ, R&D Ctr Membrane Technol, Chungli 320, Taiwan.;  Natl Cent Univ, Grad Inst Environm Engn, Chungli 320, Taiwan.;  Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Chungli 320, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,,"You, SJ (corresponding author), Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Dept Bioenvironm Engn, Chungli 320, Taiwan.",,,Membrane bioreactor; Textile dyeing wastewater; Anaerobic; Water reclamation,10.1016/j.desal.2007.09.113,Article; Proceedings Paper,,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,DESALINATION,19,234,ISI,CHUNG YUAN CHRISTIAN UNIV;CHUNG YUAN CHRISTIAN UNIV;NATL CENT UNIV;CHUNG YUAN CHRISTIAN UNIV,CHUNG YUAN CHRISTIAN UNIV,A
2009.0,Desalination,Heavy metal removal within pilotscale constructed wetlands receiving river water contaminated by confined swine operations,Yeh T;Chou C;Pan C,"Three parallel pilot-scale surface flow constructed wetlands were employed to investigate heavy metal removal receiving river water contaminated by swine confined-housing operations in Taiwan. Wastewater from swine operation contained elevated levels of copper and zinc due to their abundance in feed. Two macrophytes, namely cattail (Typha latifolia) and reed (Phragmites australis), were planted to observe their heavy metal removal efficiency. Significant total recoverable copper and zinc reduction for three tested wetlands were 80 and 91% for unplanted control, 83 and 92% for cattail, and 83 and 92% for reed wetland systems. Acid-soluble forms were 56 and 86% of total recoverable influent metals for copper and zinc, respectively. More bioavailable zinc was subjected to releasing back to aqueous environment. Heavy metals entering the studied systems as insoluble forms were settling from water column. Concentrations of metals were higher in the vegetated sediments than in the non-vegetated sediments. The sequential extraction results of sediments indicated that most retained metals were in less mobile fractions. Most of metal uptake by vegetation remained in root portions. Translocations of both copper and zinc for tested macrophytes were not prominent. The metal species in incoming water and metal fractionations in sediment were demonstrated as the major factors to influence plant metal levels. The performance of the studied wetland systems can comply with local water criteria rendering for further water reuse. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

2009.0,Desalination,Potential for reuse of high cellulose containing wastewater after membrane bioreactor treatment,You S;Wu D,"It is difficult to adequately treat wastewater with a high cellulose content with the traditional anaerobic and aerobic activated sludge processes. In this study we used microfiltration (MF) and reverse osmosis (RO) membranes combined with an anaerobic or aerobic activated sludge process to treat high cellulose containing wastewater for different hydraulic retention times (HRTs). The potential target applications for reuse of the treated wastewater are also compared. Six bioreactors, which were configured as anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (ANSBR), aerobic sequencing batch reactor (ASBR), aerobic membrane bioreactor (AMBR), AMBR plus RO (AMBR/RO). anaerobic activated sludge plus aerobic MBR (AOMBR), and AOMBR plus RO (AOMBR/RO), was operated in this study. The experiment results showed that, as expected, no effluents from the ASBR or the ANSBR could meet the Taiwan EPA criteria for effluent and wastewater reuse. no matter what the HRT was. However when the HRT was 12 h or more, the effluent from the AMBR and AOMBR processes did meet the criteria for effluent, but still did not meet the treated wastewater reuse criteria, primarily due to the color, total alkalinity, and total dissolved solid parameters. Finally, the effluents from the AMBR/RO and AOMBR/RO processes did meet the Taiwan criteria for both effluent and treated wastewater reuse when the HRT for the AOMBR/RO and AMBR/RO processes was equal to or longer than 12 h and 8 h, respectively. For the HRT of 4 h for both the AOMBR/RO and AMBR/RO process. and an HRT of 8 h for the AOMBR/RO process, neither the effluent criteria nor the treated wastewater reuse criteria were met.

2010.0,Desalination,Pilot study of drinking water treatment with GAC O3BAC and membrane processes in Kinmen Island Taiwan,Yang J;Yuan D;Weng T,"A study on advanced treatment of drinking water was conducted in a pilot scale plant in Tai Lake, Kinmen, Taiwan. The raw water contains a high concentration of disinfection by-product (DBP) precursors and causes serious odor problems. Chlorination of the raw water produced higher haloacetic acid formation potential (HAAFP) than trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP). Therefore, the high concentration of NOMs, which is the major source of DBP precursors, and the removal efficiencies of non-purgeable dissolved organic carbon (NPDOC), UV254, THMFP, HAAFP, 2-methylisoborneol (2-MIB), and trans-1, 10-dimethyl-trans-9-decalol (geosmin) were evaluated for both conventional and advanced water treatment processes. 2-MIB and geosmin can be removed efficiently by the GAC and O-3/BAC process, but bromo-THMs cannot. In addition, the removal efficiency of HAAFP was higher than that of THMFP by the GAC or O-3/BAC process. The ultrafiltration (UF)-nanofiltration (NF) combined process showed removal efficiencies for NPDOC, UV254, THMFP, HAAFP of 88.7%, 94%, 84.3% and 97.5%, respectively. This study found that the GAC or O-3/BAC process is a promising way to treat odor problems, and the UF-NF membrane process was one of the best available ways to remove NOMs and DBP formation potential.

2011.0,Desalination,Arsenic removal from real arsenicbearing groundwater by adsorption on ironoxidecoated natural rock IOCNR,Maji S;Kao Y;Liu C,"This study used iron-oxide-coated natural rock (IOCNR) an adsorbent of arsenic from real arsenic-bearing groundwater collected from the Lanyang Plain, North Eastern Taiwan. SEM and EDX were applied to characterize the as-prepared adsorbent. Batch adsorption studies were conducted at 25 +/- 2 degrees C.A 15 g L-1 dose of adsorbent removed similar to 75% of the total arsenic from the real sample when the initial arsenic concentration was 40 mu g L-1 and the pH was 7.5 (reduced to 10 mu g L-1, the maximum contaminant level (MCL)). The contact time was 6 h and the agitation speed 180 rpm. Adsorption followed the Langmuir isotherm and the maximum adsorptive capacity of IOCNR was 0.36 mg g(-1). The dimensionless parameter (R-L) and Gibbs free energy (Delta G degrees) changes suggested that the process is favorable and spontaneous. The adsorption process followed the first-order reaction kinetic model better than the other three kinetic models, and film-diffusion was the rate-limiting step. Arsenic removal efficiency of the exhausted and NaOH-regenerated IOCNR decreased in the second-cycle operation. Arsenic removal efficiency of IOCNR was comparable to that of the commercially available patented adsorbent LEWATIT FO36. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

2011.0,Desalination,Effects of UVH2O2 on NOM fractionation and corresponding DBPs formation,Lin H;Wang G,"In this study. UV/H2O2 treatment was used to evaluate its efficacy for control of natural organic matter (NOM) in different water sources in Taiwan and the results were compared with the conventional water treatment process. The NOM fractions analysis showed that compositions of NOM could be very different between the various water sources, and the raw water quality in Kin-Men (an off shore island of Taiwan) was characteristic when compared to other water sources. Raw water taken from Kin-Men generally had high dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and -50% of the NOM in the raw water was hydrophilic. After UV/H2O2 treatment, a portion of the hydrophobic fractions of NOM in raw waters were transformed into hydrophilic ones. In conventional water treatment process, coagulation and slow filtration treatments have better efficiency to reduce the NOM in water especially for the hydrophobic portion. However, the pre-chlorination treatment for raw water increased the DOC concentration due to the lysis of algae cells. This study concluded that hydrophobic acids portion is the most sensitive portion of NOM to UV/H2O2 and conventional treatment processes. Trihalomethanes formation potential (THMFP) tests showed that hydrophobic acids portion is also the main contributor to THMs formation after chlorination process.

2011.0,Desalination,Pollutant trends and hazard ranking in the desalination area of the Penghu Islands Taiwan,Lin Y;Lee C;Yang K;Lin M;Chen K;Pan C,"This work examines the distributions of potentially toxic trace elements (e.g., Cu, Zn and As) and assesses the potential hazards of contaminants to environment. Trace elements are released from seawater desalination facility in the Penghu Islands, Taiwan. Temporal trends of trace element concentrations are investigated by comparing biannual concentrations for a 2-year period (2006-2007). Analytical results demonstrate that only As in seawater had an increasing trend after 2006. Further, a hazard index (HI) is applied to assess the potential hazard of contaminants to the environment. The HI (HI =C-95%/C-allowable) is defined as the ratio of the 95th percentile for a pollutant concentration (C-95%) to an allowable concentration for each pollutant (C-allowable). The hazard index is used to establish a pollutant priority ranking and, then, serves as a useful screening tool for developing strategies for desalination pollution control. In this study, lithe priority is to improve water quality, focus should be placed on Cu (HI = 0.32). On the other hand, if the priority is sediment. quality, the As concentration (HI = 0.51) should be reduced. If the two His (seawater and sediment) are considered together, As (HI = 0.56) becomes the highest-ranking trace element, followed by Zn (HI = 0.54). (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

2013.0,Desalination,Potential impacts of discharges from seawater reverse osmosis on Taiwan marine environment,Lin Y;Chang-Chien G;Chiang P;Chen W;Lin Y,"One of the environmental concerns for seawater desalination technologies is the brine discharges with concentrate and chemicals that may pose adverse effects on the nearby marine environment. In this study, selected water quality parameters in the discharges and seawater and the presence of heavy metals of concern in the discharges, sediments, and bivalves were monitored to investigate the impacts of the discharges by two seawater desalination plants using reverse osmosis on the receiving marine environment. Relatively higher concentrations of certain heavy metals in the sediments and bivalves indicate a possible anthropogenic effect for these elements. More importantly, strong positive correlations were observed among the concentrations of heavy metals in these environmental compartments through the seasons, indicating possible adverse impacts of brine discharges on the receiving marine environment. While the discharge from reverse osmosis desalination is typically considered less environmentally detrimental due to its relatively low concentrations of contaminants, the findings suggest that heavy metals in brine discharges at trace levels may still be transported and accumulated, leading to elevated concentrations in various matrices of the receiving marine environment, and indicate the difficulty associated with current regulations that typically predict the influences or assess the impacts with short-term environmental monitoring.

2018.0,Desalination,Exploring the environmental impact assessment commissioners perspectives on the development of the seawater desalination project,Liu T;Weng T;Sheu H,"In recent years, extreme climate conditions have resulted in uneven precipitations in Taiwan. The development of traditional water resources frequently suffers from protests of environmental groups, potential dam sites being hard-to-find, and other factors. The development of new water sources has been increasingly difficult. Sea water desalination has the advantages of a short construction time and easy expansion flexibility, making it an important alternative as a new water resource. In this study, the current proposal of Tainan's desalination plant was used as an example. Qualitative interviews and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) were used to explore the environmental impact assessment (EIA) commissioner's perceptions of the impact from the development of the desalination project. The results of the qualitative interview indicate that the main concerns of the EIA commissioners are whether the development could damage the marine ecological environment and its fishery resources, which may have adverse socioeconomic consequences. The AHP results show that the commissioners' priority of environmental impact is ecological environmental impact 36.9%, social impact 29.7%, economic impact 23.7%, and physical and chemical environmental impact 9.7%. The main concerns in each impact category are, respectively, marine ecological environment, land and ocean utilisation, fisheries, and air quality.","Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Inst Ocean Technol & Marine Affairs, 1 Univ Rd, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,,"Liu, TK (corresponding author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Inst Ocean Technol & Marine Affairs, 1 Univ Rd, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and TechnologyMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [MOST 103-2221-E-006-207]",The authors would like to express sincere thanks to the officers from Water Resource Agency and the EIA commissioners for providing valuable information and assistance.

The present-day simulations capture well the genesis count, tracks, and intensity associated with TCs striking the coastal areas of Taiwan-East China (TWCN), the South China Sea-Indochina (SCS) and the vicinity of Japan (JP). The frequency of landfalling TCs over TWCN, SCS, and JP is projected to nearly half by the end of the 21st century. However, these landfalling TCs induce enhanced destructive threats of stronger winds and heavier precipitation under the future warmer climate. Through attribution analysis we found the reduced frequency of landfalling TCs to be mainly caused by a decline in TC genesis count (rather than TC track changes), while the increased intensity of landfalling TCs is linked with changes in the TC intensification rate (as opposed to duration changes). Diagnoses of the genesis potential index and eddy energetics further suggest that the mid-tropospheric drying and weakened synoptic-scale eddy activity resulting from anticyclonic and downward circulations over the main TC genesis region create an unfavorable environment for TC genesis. In contrast, warmer SST, reduced vertical wind shear and enhanced efficiency of eddy kinetic energy generations appear over the regions before TC landfall, resulting in a more rapid intensification of TCs that later approach the coastal areas.","Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, CIC FEMD ILCEC, Minist Educ, Nanjing, Peoples R China.;  Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Acad Sinica, Res Ctr Environm Changes, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Univ Taipei, Dept Earth & Life, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Japan Meteorol Business Support Ctr, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.;  Meteorol Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.;",CHINA;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;JAPAN;JAPAN,CHINA,TAIWAN,8,2.0,,"Tsou, CH (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.","National Nature Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [42088101]; Ministry of Science and Technology, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [108-2111-M-003-002, 109-2111-M-003-002]; TOUGOU Program of the MEXT, Japan [JPMXD0717935561]","The authors thank H.

1981.0,Earth Plan. Sci. Lett.,Heat flow in the southwestern Okinawa Trough,Lu R;Pan J;Lee T,"Lying to the southeast of the East China Sea continental shelf, the Okinawa Trough is believed to have been formed by crustal spreading behind the Ryukyu island arc. It has the highest mean heat flow among the Pacific marginal basins. The mean of 18 reliable measurements is 3.34±2.75 HFU. The next highest mean heat flow for a marginal basin is 2.53±1.60 HFU for the Fiji Plateau. The high mean value for the Okinawa Trough may be partially attributable to a sampling bias because most measurements were made in or near the well-sedimented central ""rift"" or graben. The reported values range from 0.36 to 10.49 HFU, with low values probably resulting from hydrothermal circulation in an area of large relief. The high heat flow suggests that the age of the Okinawa Trough may be as young as 2 Ma. Such an estimate is in gross agreement with the inferred Plio-Pleistocene age for the drifting in the Okinawa Trough. The opening of the Okinawa Trough may continue onto Taiwan but the relation between the opening of the trough and the occurrence of a nearby, onshore geothermal resource area remains unsolved. © 1981.","Institute of Oceanography, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Earth Sciences, University of California, Riverside, CA 92521, United States",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;USA,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,,"Lu, R.S.; Institute of Oceanography, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan","National Science CouncilNational Science Council, NSC","The authors wish to thank Mr. L.

1990.0,Earth Plan. Sci. Lett.,Magnetic fabric analysis of the PlioPleistocene sedimentary formations of the Coastal Range of Taiwan,Teh-Quei L T;Kissel C;Laj C;Chorng-Shern H C;Yi-Teh L Y,"Over 2100 samples were collected from 130 sedimentary sites of early Pliocene to Pleistocene age in the Coastal Range of Eastern Taiwan. Their lithology is mainly unmetamorphosed marls, siltstones and sandstones and the formations are folded and faulted at different scales. Different shapes of the susceptibility ellipsoid were observed from an oblate form, with Kmin closely perpendicular to the bedding plane, to a ""pencil"" structure, with Kmin ≈ Kint forming a girdle around Kmax, reflecting an increasing tectonic contribution to the magnetic fabric. At sites where fault tectonic analysis is available, the magnetic lineation is perpendicular to the main compression. These results have a twofold significance: first, confirming previous preliminary results, they show that in such visually undeformed sediments the magnetic fabric may be, at least in part, of tectonic origin. Second, when considered together with recent paleomagnetic and tectonic data, they suggest that in the Plio-Pleistocene sediments of the Coastal Range of Taiwan the magnetic lineation arises from the compression due to the collision of the Philippine Sea and the Eurasian plates. In our interpretation, the stress pattern has rotated clockwise along with the structures during this collision. © 1990.","Institute of Earth Sciences, Academia Sinica, P.O.

1992.0,Earth Plan. Sci. Lett.,A new genetic model for the East Taiwan Ophiolite and its implications for Dupal domains in the Northern Hemisphere,Chung S;Sun S,"The Miocene East Taiwan Ophiolite (ETO) has been suggested to have been generated at an ""abnormal"" mid-ocean ridge along a transform fault in the South China Sea [1]. As a result of arc-continent collision, the ETO was fragmented and incorporated into the Pliocene Lichi Melange of the Coastal Range, eastern Taiwan. Based on the structure of the slow-spreading Mid-Atlantic Ridge and the Tethyan Ophiolites, a new genetic model is proposed for ETO: it was formed in a normal slow-spreading axis environment where serpentinized peridotites and gabbros had been exposed onto the ocean floor. Further, we propose that ETO basalts which overlie pelagic red shales represent products of near-ridge seamounts erupted by the end of South China Sea spreading (∼ 15 Ma ago). Basalt samples collected from small areas near Kuanshan in the Coastal Range, eastern Taiwan are characterized by simple mineralogy, general lack of hydrothermal alteration, abundance of commonly fresh glass (up to 95% by volume), and high MgO content averaging 8.8 wt.%. In addition, they have considerably heterogeneous incompatible trace element (e.g. La/Sm ratios) and Nd and Pb isotope compositions. These characteristics are consistent with a magma origin from near-ridge seamounts. The Pb isotope compositions of ETO basalts and post-spreading seamount basalts from the South China Sea have Dupal anomaly characters, containing higher 208Pb204Pb ratios (with Δ208 204Pb = 31-74) than MORB of the Northern Hemisphere. The South China Sea, from which the ETO originated, is the only domain where EM2 Dupal-type Pb composition has been found in well-developed spreading centres of the Northern Hemisphere. Since volcanism in this region was not associated with mantle plume activity, the observed Dupal Pb property is probably a result of melting of convecting mantle which has been contaminated by thermal erosion and delamination of continental lithosphere with EM2 character prior to or during the formation of the South China Sea. © 1992.","Department of Geology, National Taiwan University, 245 Choushan Road, Taipei, 10770, Taiwan; Minerals and Land Use Program, Bureau of Mineral Resources, Geology and Geophysics, G.P.O.

1994.0,Earth Plan. Sci. Lett.,Oblique convergence indentation and rotation tectonics in the Taiwan Mountain Belt Insights from experimental modelling,Chia-Yu L C;Malavieille J,"Experimental modelling allows one to describe the development and kinematics of structures in mountain belts formed during oblique convergence. In the collision geometry of the Taiwan mountain belt, the Chinese continental margin is oriented about N60°E, whereas the N16°E Philippine Sea plate backstop is moving toward the Eurasian plate in the N55°W direction. Sandbox experiments have been conducted to simulate the Cenozoic arc-continent collision in Taiwan with a foreland-dipping backstop. The kinematics of deformation comprises a combination of compression and rotation which locally result in a partitioning between thrusting and wrenching. The experimental modelling shows that the faults or shear zones are rotated around the indentation point of the backstop by transcurrent and bookshelf faulting. An overall clockwise rotation (or right-lateral movements) occurs to the north of the indentation point and anticlockwise rotation occurs to the south of the indentation point. Oblique indentation and rotation structures can be demonstrated by (1) the crescent shape of the thrust wedge, (2) pull-apart structures induced by strike-slip tectonics, and (3) bookshelf-type strike-slip faulting resulting from the block rotation around the indentation point. © 1994.","Geological Institute, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan; Laboratoire de Geologie Structurale, Université Montpellier II, Montpellier, France",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;FRANCE,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,0.0,"Chia-Yu Lu; Geological Institute, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan",,NA NA,,10.1016/0012-821X(94)90085-X,Article,arc/continent collision;  oblique convergence;  plate tectonics;  sandbox model;  tectonic rotation; Taiwan,,Earth and Planetary Science Letters,115,121,scopus,NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY;UNIVERSITÉ MONTPELLIER II,NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY,B2
2005.0,Earth Plan. Sci. Lett.,An evaluation of quantitative reconstruction of past precipitation records using coral skeletal SrCa and δ18O data,Shen C;Lee T;Liu K;Hsu H;Edwards R;Wang C;Lee M;Chen Y;Lee H;Sun H,"Coupled records of δ18O and Sr/Ca in Porites coral have been used to derive hydrological conditions by removing the Sr/ Ca-inferred temperature component from the δ18O signal. Nanwan, a semi-enclosed bay in southern Taiwan, provides an opportunity to demonstrate the feasibility of quantitatively reconstructing past precipitation history. Recurrence of seawater δ18O offsets between wet and dry seasons in the early 1990s is well correlated with the precipitation record. Even though the hydrological signal only accounts for 20% of the total annual coral δ18O variation of ca. 1‰, offsets can be found in the residual δ18O of modern corals after removing the thermal effect, which contributes to the other 80%. The observed timing and amplitude of the seasonal seawater δ18O offsets in Nanwan and their correlation with precipitation are reproduced by hydrological models. In the mid-Holocene, the seasonal anomaly of residual δ18O was twice that of the modern value based on the 9-yr Sr/Ca-δ18O data recorded in a 6.73-ka Porites coral. Hydrological models suggest an annual rainfall of 1800-3000 mm/yr at the window during mid-Holocene, 20% higher than that of the average of 30-yr modern instrumental records of 1500-2500 mm, consistent with the qualitative pollen record from lake sediments. The seasonal decrease of residual δ18O in 5 of 9 yr was earlier than the increase of the coral Sr/Ca-inferred temperature, which implies that these rainy seasons probably occurred from the early-mid-spring to mid-summer, earlier than that from late spring to late summer today. The driving force may be related to the changes of solar insolation and the East Asian monsoon. It is cautioned that the variability of hydrographic conditions imposes restrictions on a precise calculation of the amount of paleo-precipitation. The dynamic nature of local tectonics, monsoons and water circulation should be further addressed to precisely quantify precipitation over the past 10,000 yr from coral geochemical records. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

2012.0,Earth Plan. Sci. Lett.,The southwestern edge of the Ryukyu subduction zone A high Q mantle wedge,Ko Y;Kuo B;Wang K;Lin S;Hung S,"The lateral edge of a subduction zone is usually depicted as an opening to the asthenosphere where invigorated dynamics and amplified magmatism take place. In this study we present evidence from seismic data suggesting the presence of a cold and dynamically sluggish edge environment at the southwest end of the Ryukyu subduction system. We measured attenuation, or 1/. Q, for P waves from subduction zone events at ~100. km depths received by OBSs in the Okinawa trough and land stations in NE Taiwan. In the Okinawa trough 100-200. km from the edge, Q values are lower than 100. In the vicinity of the edge, Q values increase from 100 to over 1000 towards Taiwan. To reconcile arguments from geophysical and geochemical observations, we propose that the mantle wedge near the edge has high Q values due to low temperatures and probably low water content. These may result from coupling of the slab laterally with the thick Eurasian lithosphere, which inhibits back-arc rifting, retards subduction, and reduces the water supply to the mantle wedge. The SW Ryukyu subduction system represents a subduction-zone edge type distinct from more commonly documented free or warm edges. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Inst. of Earth Sciences, Academia Sinica, 128 Academia Rd., Sec. 2, Taipei 115, Taiwan; Dept. of Geosciences, National Taiwan Univ., 1 Roosevelt Rd., Sec. 4, Taipei 106, Taiwan; Dept. of Earth Sciences, National Central Univ., Jhongli, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,5,1.0,,"Kuo, B.-Y.; Inst. of Earth Sciences, 128 Academia Rd., Sec. 2, Taipei 115, Taiwan; 電子郵件: byk@earth.sinica.edu.tw","National Science CouncilNational Science Council, NSC, NSC 98-2119-M-001-029","We thank Honn Kao and an anonymous reviewer for their critical questions and constructive comments, which much improved the revised manuscript.

2021.0,Earth Sci. Inform.,Streetblock collapsed buildings assessment A case study of Banqiao District New Taipei City,Lo I;Lin C;Yang C;Chuang Y;Lin C,"After a large-scale earthquake, it induces a large number of building collapses and casualties, especially in urban areas. In order to make prevention and response plans before earthquakes, various earthquake loss estimation systems have been developed. The commonly used units of analysis in those systems include grid and village (or administrative district). However, grids are not consistent with streets/roads, making grid-based analyses impractical for evacuation and rescue road planning. As for village-based analyses, a unit covers large spaces and might fail to point out the precise location of collapsed buildings. Therefore, street block, which is a block surrounded by roads, is proposed by the authors as an alternative. To figure out the better analytical units, this study compared street-block-based analyses and village-based analyses. Banqiao District in Taiwan was used as a case to delineate the street blocks by roads with a width of 6 meters or above. Building collapse assessment under peak ground acceleration (PGA) of 400 Gal and 550 Gal demonstrates that street-block-based analyses outperform village-based analyses in terms of locating the collapsed buildings. Moreover, street blocks are readily available for planning evacuation or rescue roads for their consistence with the road network. Results of this study suggest that in urban areas, the higher-resolution spatial analyses of earthquake loss estimation can be made by street-block-based analyses.","Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Architecture, Taipei 10607, Taiwan.;  Natl Ctr Res Earthquake Engn, Taipei 10668, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,5,1.0,,"Lin, CH (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Res Earthquake Engn, Taipei 10668, Taiwan.",,,Street block; Building collapse; Earthquake assessment; Evacuation; Road planning,10.1007/s12145-020-00550-w,Article,,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS,0,14,ISI,NATL TAIWAN UNIV SCI AND TECHNOL;NATL CTR RES EARTHQUAKE ENGN,NATL CTR RES EARTHQUAKE ENGN,A
2020.0,Earth Sci. Informatics,Estimating landslide occurrence via small watershed method with relevance vector machine,Liao K;Hoang N;Chang S,"The mechanism of landslide occurrence is complicated due to the dependency and nonlinear relationship of various physical factors. A promising prediction model, which can be used to locate the high-risk regions and a corresponding prevention strategy can be prepared to reduce the slide occurrence and its consequence, is therefore desired. To perform the landslide assessment for a large-scale slope, this study proposes to use the method of small watershed that is integrated with Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) to enhance the prediction accuracy. Effect of physiographic and hydrological factors such as slope steepness, dip slope ratio, landslide ratio, and cumulative rainfall are investigated. To estimate the occurrence of landslide, RVM first maps the aforementioned factors into a feature space using Gaussian radial basis function. A linear boundary, distinguishing landslide or not, is then obtained through the search of the optimal weights. To find these weights, a Bayesian theory-based optimization problem is formulated and solved by iteratively reweighted least squares algorithm and the Laplace approximation procedure. The proposed model is validated by the data collected from Kaoping River Basin. Results indicate that the proposed RVM-based small watershed approach possesses a prediction accuracy of 87.5%, which is better than those of using Support Vector Machine (SVM), Least-Square Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM), and logistic regression, providing authorities in their hazard alert system to minimize the life or property losses caused by the landslide. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Department of Bioenvironmental Systems Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan; Lecturer, Faculty of Civil Engineering, Institute of Research and Development, Duy Tan University, 254 Nguyễn Văn Linh, P, Thanh Khê, Đà Nẵng, 550000, Viet Nam; Department of Bioenvironmental Systems Engineering, National Taiwan University, Da’an District, Taipei City, 10617, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,1.0,"Liao, K.-W.; Department of Bioenvironmental Systems Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: kliao@ntu.edu.tw","Ministry of Science and Technology, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST Ministerio de Ciencia y TecnologÃ­aMinisterio de Ciencia y TecnologÃ­a, MICYT Soil and Water Conservation BureauSoil and Water Conservation Bureau, SWCB, MOST 107-2622-E-011-020 -CC2",This study was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) of Taiwan and Soil and Water Conservation Bureau. under grant number MOST 107-2622-E-011-020 -CC2.

2016.0,Earth Sci. Res. J.,Water temperature prediction in a subtropical subalpine lake using soft computing techniques,Samadianfard S;Kazemi H;Kisi O;Liu W,"Lake water temperature is one of the key parameters in determining the ecological conditions within a lake, as it influences both chemical and biological processes. Therefore, accurate prediction of water temperature is crucially important for lake management. In this paper, the performance of soft computing techniques including gene expression programming (GEP), which is a variant of genetic programming (GP), adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict hourly water temperature at a buoy station in the Yuan-Yang Lake (YYL) in north-central Taiwan at various measured depths was evaluated. To evaluate the performance of the soft computing techniques, three different statistical indicators were used, including the root mean squared error (RMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE), and the coefficient of correlation (R). Results showed that the GEP had the best performances among other studied methods in the prediction of hourly water temperature at 0, 2 and 3 meter depths below water surface, but there was a different trend in the 1 meter depth below water surface. In this depth, the ANN had better accuracy than the GEP and ANFIS. Despite the error (RMSE value) is smaller in ANN than GEP, there is an upper bound in scatter plot of ANN that imposes a constant value, which is not suitable for predictive purposes. As a conclusion, results from the current study demonstrated that GEP provided moderately reasonable trends for the prediction of hourly water temperature in different depths.","Univ Tabriz, Dept Water Engn, Tabriz, Iran.;  Canik Basari Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Samsun, Turkey.;  Natl United Univ, Dept Civil & Disaster Prevent Engn, Miaoli, Taiwan.;",IRAN;TURKEY;TAIWAN,IRAN,IRAN,4,3.0,,"Samadianfard, S (corresponding author), Univ Tabriz, Dept Water Engn, Tabriz, Iran.",,,Soft computing techniques; statistical indicators; subalpine lake; water temperature,10.15446/esrj.v20n2.43199,Article,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; DAILY PAN EVAPORATION; GENERAL-CIRCULATION MODEL; AIR-TEMPERATURE; QUALITY; TAIWAN; ENVIRONMENT; ANN,UNIV NACIONAL DE COLOMBIA,Earth Sciences Research Journal,8,20,ISI,UNIV TABRIZ;CANIK BASARI UNIV;NATL UNITED UNIV,UNIV TABRIZ,A
2018.0,Earth Sci. Res. J.,An Assessment Method for Debris Flow Dam Formation in Taiwan,Chen K;Lin C;Chen X;Hu G;Guo X;Shieh C,"Debris flows in tributaries rush into and block the main branches of rivers and often result in serious hazards. Dam failures cause large floods in the downstream area and can lead to fatalities and property damage.

2019.0,Earth Syst. Sci. Data,Field investigations of coastal sea surface temperature drop after typhoon passages,Doong D;Peng J;Babanin A,"Sea surface temperature (SST) variability affects marine ecosystems, fisheries, ocean primary productivity and human activities and is the primary influence on typhoon intensity. SST drops of a few degrees in the open ocean after typhoon passages have been widely documented; however, few studies have focused on coastal SST variability. The purpose of this study is to determine typhoon-induced SST drops in the near-coastal area (within 1 km of the coast) and understand the possible mechanism. The results of this study were based on extensive field data analysis. Significant SST drop phenomena were observed at the Longdong Buoy in northeastern Taiwan during 43 typhoons over the past 20 years (1998-2017). The mean SST drop (Delta SST) after a typhoon passage was 6.1 degrees C, and the maximum drop was 12.5 degrees C (Typhoon Fungwong in 2008). The magnitude of the SST drop was larger than most of the observations in the open ocean. The mean duration of the SST drop was 24 h, and on average, 26.1 h were required for the SST to recover to the original temperature. The coastal SST drops at Longdong were correlated with the moving tracks of typhoons. When a typhoon passes south of Longdong, the strong and persistent longshore winds induce coastal upwelling and pump cold water up to the surface, which is the dominant cause of the SST drops along the coast. In this study, it was determined that cold water mainly intruded from the Kuroshio subsurface into the Okinawa Trough, which is approximately 50 km from the observation site. The magnitude of coastal SST drops depends on the area of overlap between typhoons generating strong winds and the Kuroshio.","Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Hydraul & Ocean Engn, Tainan, Taiwan.;  Leibniz Inst Balt Sea Res Warnemuende IOW, Rostock, Germany.;  Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Sch Engn, Dept Infrastruct Engn, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.;",TAIWAN;GERMANY;AUSTRALIA,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,1.0,"Doong, DJ (corresponding author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Hydraul & Ocean Engn, Tainan, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) of TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 106-2628-E-006-008-MY3]","This research was performed with support from the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) of Taiwan under grant no.

2016.0,Earth-Sci. Rev.,From the highest to the deepest The Gaoping RiverGaoping Submarine Canyon dispersal system,Liu J;Hsu R;Hung J;Chang Y;Wang Y;Rendle-Buhring R;Lee C;Huh C;Yang R,"There are many different source-to-sink dispersal systems around the world, and the Gaoping River (GPR)-Gaoping Submarine Canyon (GPSC) provides an example especially as a canyon-captured system. The GPR, a small mountainous river having an average gradient of 1:150, and the GPSC, which links the river catchment to the deep-sea basin, represent two major topographic features around SW Taiwan. Together, they constitute a terrestrial-to-marine dispersal system that has an overriding impact on the source-to-sink transport of sediment in this region. The GPSC extents from the mouth of the GPR through the shelf and slope and into the northeastern Manila Trench, a distance of about 260 km. It is a major conduit for the transport of terrestrial sediment and carbon to the South China Sea and the landward transport of particles of marine and biological origin. In the GPSC the dominant mode of suspended-sediment transport is tidal oscillations and the net direction is up canyon. In contrast, sediment transport associated with episodic gravity-driven events is down-canyon. The steady sedimentation of the tidal regime results in hemipelagic mud across the canyon floor, whereas the gravity-driven (hyperpycnal) regime causes turbidite erosion and deposition along the canyon thalweg. Typhoon-induced river floods often lead to hyperpycnal plumes at the river mouth, which directly and indirectly ignite hyperpycnal turbidity currents in the canyon forming an effective agent for transporting large amounts of terrestrial organic material (modem and fossil carbon) to the South China Sea basin. Therefore, the GPR-GPSC represents a source-to-sink system in which terrestrial sediment in a mountainous catchment is promptly removed and transported to the deep sea by episodic gravity flows. This is also a pathway by which modern terrestrial organic carbon is quickly and effectively delivered to the deep sea. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This study synthesizes existing clay mineralogical and geochemical data from similar to 1500 samples from the seafloor and surrounding rivers, deepwater mooring observation results, and high resolution glacial-cyclic clay mineralogy records from six high-quality sediment cores. Source-to-sink sediment transport from the river mouth to the continental shelf and then to the abyssal basin is investigated at two time scales: modern process and Late Quaternary glacial cycles. The results firstly show the high diversity of clay mineralogical and geochemical compositions in riverbed surface sediments surrounding the South China Sea, e.g., dominant illite and chlorite in Taiwan, overwhelming majority of smectite in Luzon, dominant kaolinite in South China, and similar amounts of the four clay mineral species in Red and Mekong river systems. The formation of these fluvial sediments through chemical weathering in surrounding drainage systems is controlled principally by the East Asian monsoon climate with warm temperature and high precipitation, and subordinately by tectonic activity and specific lithological character. The basin-wide distribution of clay mineral assemblages combined with neodymium and strontium isotopic compositions reflects strong provenance control and differential settling effects. The differential settling of kaolinite in slightly saline and proximal regions relative to smectite in more saline and distal regions is well demonstrated in the South China Sea. Through combining clay mineralogical distributions on the seafloor with observed oceanic current systems, the modern transport pathways can be well established, e.g., in the northern South China Sea, illite and chlorite from Taiwan are mainly carried by contour currents with the strong influence of mesoscale eddies. High-resolution sediment dynamic analysis for the Late Quaternary reveals different sediment transport patterns in the northern, western, and southern South China Sea when the land-sea configuration dramatically changed during glacial conditions. In the north, the terrigenous dispersal is mainly controlled by provenance supply and oceanic current transport. In the west, the clay mineral assemblage reflects variations of the prevailing surface current influenced by monsoon winds. In the south, the clay mineral input indicates intensive chemical weathering during interglacial periods and strengthened physical erosion during glacial periods. The transport of terrigenous sediments since the last glaciation is quantitatively reconstructed through studying two deepwater sediment cores located in the northern South China Sea. The relative contributions from three provenances (South China, Luzon, and Taiwan) highlight their distinct variability over the last 28 ka, implying that the southward shift of the inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ) at 16 Ka BP caused an increased sediment contribution from South China, the intensified influence of the Kuroshio Current intrusion controls more efficient westward transport of Luzon sediments, and the stronger deepwater current transports Taiwan-sourced sediments further westward from the last glaciation to the Holocene.

2018.0,Earth-Sci. Rev.,Juxtaposed sequence stratigraphy temporalspatial variations of sedimentation and development of modernforming forearc Lichi Melange in North Luzon Trough forearc basin onshore and offshore eastern Taiwan An overview,Huang C;Chen W;Wang M;Lin C;Yang S;Li X;Yu M;Zhao X;Yang K;Liu C;Hsieh Y;Harris R,"The South China Sea oceanic lithosphere has been subducting eastward beneath the Huatung Basin/Philippine Sea Plate since the Early Miocene (similar to 18 Ma). The subduction is followed by the oblique collision between the Luzon arc and the subducting Eurasian plate from 6.5 Ma. The North Luzon Trough forearc strata and the Luzon arc are then obducted northwestward as the Coastal Range, eastern Taiwan, in the last 1 Ma. The collision propagates southward and is presently active in the region offshore SE Taiwan. Integrating seismic surveys offshore and a detailed forearc stratigraphy study onshore the Coastal Range, this paper overviews the characteristics of forearc deformation, dynamic sequence stratigraphy, temporal-spatial variations of forearc sedimentation and stratigraphic correlation onshore and offshore forearc sequences in response to the oblique convergent tectonics north of 20 degrees N. Combining onshore and offshore forearc geology together allows us to reconstruct a structural evolution of the North Luzon Trough forearc basin from subduction through collision to obduction, and to discuss the mechanism and processes responsible for developments of the modern-forming forearc Lichi Melange during the active Taiwan orogeny. Seismic surveys offshore show that forearc deformation in the subduction zone is primarily caused by increase of rear prism slope and west-vergent thrusting of forearc strata along the prism top since the early forearc sedimentation. East-vergent backthrusting occurs during the late forearc sedimentation and propagates arcward when the volcanic arc collides with the accretionary prism in the collision zone. Bivergent thrusting leads to a development of the forearc Huatung Ridge popup as a bathymetric high which further controls the sedimentation of the younger forearc sequence in the collision zone. In response to the syn-sedimentation deformation, forearc depocenter shifts progressively eastward. Forearc stratigraphy thus changes from two syn-sequences bounded by an unconformity in the subduction zone to three mega-sequences juxtaposed from west to east unconformably in the collision zone. As a consequence, the forearc deformation and stratigraphy in the oblique collision zone off SE Taiwan show a characteristic temporal-spatial pattern that the lowest mega-sequence with the most intensive deformation occurs restrictedly in the west, whiles the middle and the upper mega-sequences with mild deformation crop out in the center and the eastern part of the forearc basin, respectively. Detailed biostratigraphy study using planktonic foraminifera and calcareous nannoplanktons indicates that the forearc strata onshore the Coastal Range are also composed of three sequences (lower unit S-1: 6.5-5.8 Ma; middle unit S-2: 5.8-3.0 Ma; and upper unit S-3: < 3.0-1 Ma). They were previously mapped as lithostratigraphy units of the Lichi Melange (6.5-3.0 Ma) in the west and the coherent flysch sequences of the Fanshuliao Formation (5.8-3.0 Ma) and the Paliwan Formation (< 3.0-1 Ma) the east. However, the young coherent forearc sequences in the east thrust westward ubiquitously over the old and highly deformed Lichi Melange in the west along the listric east-dipping Tuluanshan fault during the obduction. Detailed biostratigraphy study reveals that the lower sequence unit S-1 exposes restrictedly in the Lichi Melange west of the Tuluanshan fault, whereas the middle sequence unit S-2 are either mapped as part of the Lichi Melange or the coherent Fanshuliao Formation in both sides of the Tuluanshan fault, respectively. The upper sequence unit S-3 exposes exclusively east of middle sequence unit S-2 in the eastern Coastal Range. Stratigraphy and sedimentology study also reveals a temporal-spatial sedimentation variation of the upper sequence unit S-3 owing to deformation of the sequence units S-1 and S-2 together as a Pliocene Forearc Ridge at similar to 3 Ma, a scenario analog to development of the modern Huatung Ridge at similar to 1 Ma in active collision zone offshore. Temporal-spatial pattern of forearc sequences onshore the Coastal Range suggests that these three sequence units are juxtaposed from west to east and are bounded by two unconformities analog to what occur today in the collision zone offshore SE Taiwan. The characteristic deformation and an eastward-youngling trend of strata distribution onshore the Coastal Range all indicate Syn-sedimentation deformation during the oblique collision in 6.5-1 Ma. Furthermore, along the N-S orogenic strike, events of the forearc sedimentation and bivergent thrusting occur earlier onshore the obduction zone in the north than the modem collision zone offshore in the south. Across the orogenic strike forearc strata get older and deformation gets intensive from east to west onshore the Coastal Range, a scenario analog to what observed in the oblique convergent region offshore SE Taiwan. A structure reconstruction reveals that the North Luzon Trough forearc strata have experienced multiple stages of thrust deformation from subduction through collision to obduction. These deformations account for the mechanism and processes to develop the modem-forming highly sheared SSZ-bearing forearc Lichi Melange tectonically in the western Coastal Range during the last 1 Ma.","Tongji Univ, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China.;  Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Tainan 701, Taiwan.;  Chinese Acad Sci, Guangzhou Inst Geochem, Key Lab Marginal Sea Geol, Guangzhou 510640, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;  CPC Corp, Explorat & Dev Res Inst, Miaoli 36042, Taiwan.;  Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanog, Ctr Deep Sea Res, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China.;  Guangzhou Marine Geol Survey, Guangzhou 51076, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.;  Brigham Young Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Provo, UT 84602 USA.;",CHINA;TAIWAN;CHINA;TAIWAN;CHINA;CHINA;TAIWAN;USA,CHINA,CHINA,12,2.0,2.0,"Huang, CY (corresponding author), Tongji Univ, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China.","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41472093, U1505231, 91528301]; Guangzhou Marine Geological Survey, China [20161972, DD20160138-01]","The authors thank PinXian Wang of the Tongji University, Shanghai, Chengshan Wang of the China University of Geosciences, Beijing, and Dou-Fu Chen of the Shanghai Ocean University in Shanghai, China, for their constructive discussions during the study.

2002.0,Econ. Geol. Bull. Soc. Econ. Geol.,Origin of a dolomiterelated jade deposit at Chuncheon Korea,Yui T;Kwon S,"The Chuncheon nephrite deposit in Korea is among the largest nephrite jade deposits worldwide. The deposit is hosted in Precambrian dolomitic marble and amphibole schist that were intruded by the posttectonic (Late Triassic) Chuncheon granite. Carbonates in the dolomitic marble and nephrite deposit have oxygen and carbon isotope compositions in the range of -0.1 to +18.2 per mil and -4.3 to +0.9 per mil, and -0.4 to +3.5 per mil and -9.9 to -4.7 per mil, respectively. These data are in agreement with decarbonation processes driven by fluid infiltration forming the nephrite deposit from dolomitic marble in the temperature range of 330degrees to 430degreesC. Stable isotope compositions of silicates from the nephrite deposit are homogeneous and extremely depleted in O-18 and D; tremolite has delta(18)O = -9.9 to -7.9 per mil and deltaD -118 to -105 per mil; diopside has delta(18)O = -13.6 to -11.5 per mil; three samples of grossular have delta(18)O -4.4, +10.4, and +11.5 per mil; clinochlore has delta(18)O = -9.5 to -9.0 per mil, and deltaD = -103 to -94 per mil; and two talc veins have delta(18)O = -7.7 and -7.3 per mil, and deltaD = -86 and -90 per mil. Quartz and amphibole in nearby amphibole schists also have variable oxygen isotope compositions of -4.7 to +0.5 per mil and -8.4 to -0.6 per mil, respectively, and are not in isotopic equilibrium. It is suggested that the formation of this nephrite deposit postdated the metamorphism of the country rocks. The distinctly negative delta(18)O values also indicate that the infiltrated fluid was mainly of meteoric origin and its circulation was most likely related to the intrusion of the nearby posttectonic Chuncheon granite. Model calculations demonstrate that the fluid/rock ratios were high, that both oxygen and hydrogen isotope compositions of nephrite were mainly buffered by the fluid phase, and that X-CO2, of the fluid phase was very low during the nephrite formation. These conditions contrast with the formation of nephrite deposits that are spatially associated with serpentinites (e.g., Fengtien nephrite deposit, Taiwan). Such deposits are formed by fluid infiltration during regional metamorphism and their oxygen isotope compositions are mainly buffered by the host serpentinite.","Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei 115, Taiwan.; Yonsei Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Seoul 120749, South Korea.;",TAIWAN;KOREA,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,,"Yui, TF (corresponding author), Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei 115, Taiwan.",,,,10.2113/gsecongeo.97.3.593,Article,OXYGEN-ISOTOPE FRACTIONATION; STABLE ISOTOPE; HYDROGEN ISOTOPE; ULTRAMAFIC ROCKS; SOUTH-KOREA; CARBON; SERPENTINIZATION; COLLISION; OPHIOLITE; CALCITE,ECONOMIC GEOLOGY PUBL CO,ECONOMIC GEOLOGY AND THE BULLETIN OF THE SOCIETY OF ECONOMIC GEOLOGISTS,35,97,ISI,INST EARTH SCI;YONSEI UNIV,INST EARTH SCI,A

The samples are collected from the cores drilled for the Taiwan Chelungpu Fault Drilling Project (TCDP, borehole B). Three fault zones are recognized as candidates for the source of seismogenic materials. The fault zones are composed of fractured-damaged rocks, breccia, gray gouge, black gouge, and black material. Chlorite from each type of rock was analyzed by using X-ray diffraction (XRD). The iron content and asymmetry of the iron and magnesium ions in thechlorites were estimated from the XRD peak ratios. The hydroxide and silicate layers of chlorite in the black gouge and black material have low iron contents. Many studies have suggested that a temperature rise occurred at the fault zones. In addition, the temperature rise can result in the production of iron oxides such as magnetite or maghemite, as reported by other studies. However, the temperature rise cannot explain the low value of iron content in the chlorites. Another reason for the low value of iron content is the variation in the pH of the fluid, which can be controlled by radical reactions. Therefore, on the basis of chlorite characteristics, the reactions at the seismogenic fault are due not only to the thermal decomposition resulting from the temperature rise and but also to rock-fluid interactions.","Department of Natural Environmental Science, Kochi University, Kochi, Japan; Marine Works Japan Ltd., Nankoku, Japan; Kochi Institute for Core Sample Research, Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology, Nankoku, Japan; Department of Earth and Space Science, Graduate School of Science, Osaka University, Toyonaka, Japan; Center for Advanced Marine Core Research, Kochi University, Nankoku, Japan; Department of Geosciences, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan; Center for Deep Earth Exploration, Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology, Yokohama, Japan; Faculty of Education, Tokyo Gakugei University, Koganei, Japan; Department of Earth Sciences, Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Yamaguchi University, Yamaguchi, Japan; Institute for Research on Earth Evolution, Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology, Yokosuka, Japan; Institute of Geology and Geoinformation, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Japan; Institute for Geo-Resources and Environment, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Japan; Earthquake Research Department, National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention, Tsukuba, Japan; Department of Geoenvironmental Science, Graduate School of Science, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan; Department of Earth and Planetary Systems Science, Hiroshima University, Japan; Department of Geophysics, School of Earth Sciences, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States",JAPAN;JAPAN;JAPAN;JAPAN;JAPAN;JAPAN;JAPAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;JAPAN;JAPAN;JAPAN;JAPAN;JAPAN;JAPAN;JAPAN;JAPAN;JAPAN;JAPAN;JAPAN;USA,JAPAN,JAPAN,28,8.0,0.0,"Hashimoto, Y.; Department of Natural Environmental Science, , Kochi, Japan; 電子郵件: hassy@cc.kochi-u.ac.jp",,NA NA NA,,10.5194/ee-3-1-2008,Article,chlorite;  fault zone;  fluid-structure interaction;  fracture zone;  iron;  magnesium;  thermal decomposition;  X-ray diffraction; Chelungpu Fault Zone;  Taiwan,Copernicus GmbH,eEarth,11,3,scopus,KOCHI UNIVERSITY;KOCHI INSTITUTE FOR CORE SAMPLE RESEARCH;OSAKA UNIVERSITY;KOCHI UNIVERSITY;NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY;JAPAN AGENCY FOR MARINE-EARTH SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY;TOKYO GAKUGEI UNIVERSITY;YAMAGUCHI UNIVERSITY;INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH ON EARTH EVOLUTION;INSTITUTE OF GEOLOGY AND GEOINFORMATION;INSTITUTE FOR GEO-RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT;NATIONAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE FOR EARTH SCIENCE AND DISASTER PREVENTION;TOHOKU UNIVERSITY;HIROSHIMA UNIVERSITY;STANFORD UNIVERSITY,DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE,B2
2020.0,Elementa,Anthropogenic 129I in the South China Sea and coastal waters around Taiwan,Burr G;Matsuzaki H;Wang B;Kusuno H;Tokuyama H;Yamagata T;Yu T;Wang S;Chang C;Jull A;Lo C,"In this article, we present a study of seawater 129I/127I time-series data from several coastal sites in Taiwan, including Yehliu Geopark (north–northeast coast), Kaohsiung (southwest coast), and Zhuwei Fishing Village (northwest coast). The objective of this study was to document how 129I/127I responds to known seasonal variations in the surface ocean currents that carry 129I to each of these sites. The responses were shown to be quite distinct. The Zhuwei site, across Mainland China, had elevated spring and summer 129I/127I values, with abrupt peaks that reflected transient cross-strait currents that carry seawater with elevated 129I to the northwest coast of Taiwan. The Yehliu site, which receives all of its seawater from the Kuroshio Current, had relatively low and uniform 129I/127I values year-round. The Kaohsiung site showed a summertime minimum that likely stems from upwelling upstream induced by oceanic eddies associated with the Kuroshio intrusion. To our knowledge, these are the first continuous coastal 129I/127I time-series data published for Asian waters and the first to show large, abrupt, and regional 129I/127I changes in the surface seawater. We also documented 129I/127I values from multiple surface ocean sites in the South China Sea (SCS), including a vertical profile from the South East Asia Time-Series Station that extends to a depth of 3,700 m. The 129I from both coastal Taiwan and surface waters of the SCS is &gt;98% anthropogenic, primarily released to the environment as a byproduct of nuclear fuel reprocessing.

2021.0,Elementa,Highresolution records of anthropogenic activity and geohazards from the reservoir of Sun Moon Lake Central Taiwan,Chen H;Wei K;Huang J;Lin C;Su C;Song G;Li H;Lee T;Song S;Pan H,"Sun Moon Lake is the first dam reservoir constructed in Taiwan with the capability of generating hydroelectricity satisfying the whole Taiwan need during the Japanese colonial period since 1934 CE. Now, the Sun Moon Lake is one of the biggest hydropower stations in Taiwan and has become an important touring area. During World War II (1944–1945 CE), the hydroelectric power plant at Sun Moon Lake was bombed by the U.S. air force, which caused severe damage to the dam structure. More recently, the dam structure was also damaged during the 1999 CE Chi-Chi earthquake whose epicenter is nearby in the Nantou County. A suite of cores were taken from both Sun Lake and Moon Lake, and two selected cores, Sun 2–1 and SM 16 4–3, from Sun Lake were detailed studied with multiple analyses, including X-ray imaging, magnetic susceptibility, visible spectrophotometry, X-ray fluorescence (XRF) scanning, and mineral analysis. We discovered that the increase of Ca content in the sediments not only clearly indicates when the dam was constructed at Sun Moon Lake but also records evidence of structure repairs after both the World War II bombing and the Chi-Chi earthquake. Additionally, the yellow turbidite, X-ray image, and low-Ca signals in Core Sun 2–1 strongly correlate to the typhoon events that caused severe floods in the watershed of Zhuoshui River. The turbidite layers caused by the 1963 Gloria Typhoon are also characterized by conspicuous high peak of Fe/Mn in both cores. This study shows that XRF scanning results are useful for recognition of human activity and for high precipitation event correlation. Moreover, the appearance of charcoal layers shows evidence of forest burning and slash-and-burn activities by humans during the past 4,000 years back to the Middle Neolithic Age. © 2021 The Author(s).","Institute of Earth Sciences, National Taiwan Ocean University, Keelung, Taiwan; Center of Excellence for Oceans, National Taiwan Ocean University, Keelung, Taiwan; Department of Geosciences, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan; Institute of Geology, University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria; Institute of Oceanography, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan; Institute of Earth Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;AUSTRIA;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,10,1.0,1.0,"Chen, H.-F.; Institute of Earth Sciences, Taiwan; 電子郵件: diopside0412@yahoo.com.tw; Wei, K.-Y.; Department of Geosciences, Taiwan; 電子郵件: weiky@ntu.edu.tw","Ministry of Science and Technology, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST, MOST-105-2116-M-019-003 Environmental Protection Administration, Executive Yuan, R.O.C.

2021.0,Elementa,Social environmental analysis of estuary water quality in a populous urban area,Tseng H;Newton A;Gong G;Lin C,"Asia has been experiencing rapid industrialization, urbanization, and economic growth in recent decades. Taiwan was one of the 4 Asian dragons, regions that experienced rapid industrialization and exceptionally high growth rates between the early 1960s and 1990s, but at a high cost to the environment, and thus, it was heavily polluted. Estuaries are highly dynamic and diverse ecosystems that provide multiple ecosystem services that maintain marine ecosystem health and benefit humankind. However, estuaries and the ecosystem services they provide are rapidly degrading due to increasing pressures and changes, especially those in populous, urban areas. Social–environmental analysis integrates scientific information and social activities and thereby provides a comprehensive understanding for the multiparty, joint decision-making processes necessary for successful, sustainable management. In this study, 60 years of economic data and 26 years of water quality data are examined using social–environmental frameworks, the driver-pressure-state-impact-response framework, and the systems approach framework to analyze the management of water quality for an estuary in a populous urban area, the Tamsui River estuary, in Taiwan. Potential societal responses and management measures are identified that can be implemented to reduce human activities, diminish pressure, ameliorate water quality, and enhance the state of the estuarine systems in the Tamsui River and its estuary. The recommended societal responses are increased education, the establishment of community-based river rangers, wetland and mangrove conservation, the development of a circular economy, the implementation of governance measures, and improvements in monitoring and assessments. Improvement of the water quality in the Tamsui River estuary increases the hedonic value of property for people who live near the riverside. Currently, the number of tourists and tourism-based businesses have increased. Nevertheless, improvements in water quality in the Tamsui River estuary bring well-being and benefits that could be further enhanced to increase the cost/benefit relation of the management measures.

2013.0,Episodes,Implications of river chemistry variations on an orogenic subtropical island a preliminary study,Lin G;Chen H;Lin S;Lien K,"The study collected water samples from three rivers in southern Taiwan to understand the temporal and spatial variations of major dissolved ions, including Ne, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Cl-, SO42-, HCO3- and H4SiO4, and to explore the relationships between chemical and physical weathering in an orogenic and tropical area. During 2006-2007, total dissolved solid discharge (TDS discharge) from the investigated rivers was calculated to be around 3.27 Mt/yr, and 60 % of dissolved ions were attributable to the outcrop of silicate. However, TDS discharge occupied just 3 % of total delivered material in the river water Accordingly, physical transport plays a decisive role in weathering process with only a small fraction capable of going through chemical dissolution in reaching the river The investigation results also show that the huge amount of water discharge in rainy seasons dilute ion concentrations, and that sea spray delivered by monsoon and compositions or properties of source rocks also induce spatial variations of dissolved ions. Additionally, areas with low strength rock have more dissolved material in the river water.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei 10764, Taiwan.;  Columbia Univ, Dept Civil Engn & Engn Mech, New York, NY 10027 USA.;  Natl Sci & Technol Ctr Disaster Reduct, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, Taipei 10764, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;USA;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,4,1.0,1.0,"Lin, GW (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, 1,Sect 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 10764, Taiwan.","National Science Council, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan; Forest Bureau of the Agriculture Council","This work was supported by the National Science Council, Taiwan, and the Forest Bureau of the Agriculture Council.

Res.,The evening study program in Taiwan Voices from the students,Kuan Y;Yang C;Ho H;Chen S;Chang Y;Wang L,"People in the countries which are influenced by Confucius philosophy view education and passing school entrance exam as one of the most important goals. The strict competitions in these societies force students actively seek cram schools for academic improvement. The social culture of attending cram schools has increased the financial burden of students' families and inequity of education. To face this problem, the new policy that implemented by the Ministry of Education in Taiwan is ""Evening Study Program"". This program tries to offer learning opportunities for students after regular school hours with very low cost. This program is believed can increase school's competitiveness and achieve the goal of educational equality. However, very few studies explore this program and participants' experiences. Therefore, this study applied semistructural interview as research method. Six students who participated in the ESP program of one junior high school in Taiwan were interviewed. Their voices and experiences were analyzed in this study.

2020.0,Expo. Health,Assessing Japan Imported Food Products Radiation Doses and Exposure Risk Following the Fukushima Nuclear Accident,Lien K;Ling M;Pan M,"During the period of 2011- 2018, more than 14,000 batches of Japanese foodstuffs that were imported into Taiwan were inspected. Among these, only trace levels of radiation were detected in 224 batches. Nevertheless, there is growing concern in Taiwan about the threat posed by radionuclide contamination to food safety. To assess this risk, we conducted a detailed investigation of this issue entailing an estimation of the internal radiation dose and lifetime cancer risk associated with food ingestion among Taiwan's population. Our results indicated that in the worst-case scenario, the highest exposure level of the annual committed effective dose ( CED) from ingestion of cesium radionuclides within males aged 15- 19 years was 0.0057 mSv per year. This value was well below the CED of 1 mSv per year for radionuclides. Moreover, in 19-65 years male consumer only-max group, the nominal risks for solid cancers, leukemia, and thyroid cancer were 5.32, 1.36, and 0.23 per 10,000 cases, respectively, calculated on the basis of conservative assumptions (worst-case scenario). In 19-65 years female whole group-mean group, the nominal risks for solid cancers, leukemia, thyroid, and breast cancer were 0.14, 0.04, 0.03, and 0.19 per 10,000 cases, respectively. In the general situation, we posit that in the current regulatory policy and radioactivity exposure scenario, radionuclides present in food pose no significant safety risk in Taiwan.

2014.0,Finisterra,Outdoor thermal perception in different climatic regions Initial results from taichung Taiwan and lisbon Portugal,Lin T;Andrade H;Oliveira S;Hwang R;Matzarakis A,"People living in different climatic regions have adapted to specific weather conditions and their tolerance to high temperatures and wind speeds is diverse. This study analyses the effect of thermal adaptations on the thermal perception of users of outdoor spaces in two different regions: Taichung (Taiwan) and Lisbon (Portugal), by means of field surveys and measurements of weather parameters. The thermal acceptable range, representing the satisfaction of people with thermal conditions, was calculated based on the Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET) and the results obtained for each region were compared. People in Lisbon are less satisfied with higher values of PET than in Taiwan, due to the adaptation of local people to higher values of air temperature and relative humidity in Taiwan. On the contrary, people in Lisbon showed a higher tolerance to strong wind, as a result of their exposure to higher average wind speeds than those in Taiwan. The results demonstrated that people's thermal perceptions vary with different climatic and cultural background. The influence of thermal adaptations in the use of outdoor spaces can contribute to improve the quality of these spaces, adapting them to the preferences of local users.","Department of Architecture, National Cheng Kung University, 1 University Road, Tainan, 701, Taiwan; CEG/IGOT/ULisboa, Institute of Geography and Spatial Planning, Universidade de Lisboa, Portugal; NICIF, Faculty of Letters, University of Coimbra, Largo da Porta Férrea, Coimbra, 3004-530, Portugal; Department of Architecture, National United University, 1 Lienda, Miaoli, 360, Taiwan; Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg, Freiburg, D-79085, Germany",TAIWAN;PORTUGAL;PORTUGAL;TAIWAN;GERMANY,TAIWAN,,5,1.0,,,,NA NA NA NA,Human biometeorology;  Portugal;  Taiwan;  Thermal perception,10.18055/Finis6455,Article,,Universidade de Lisboa,Finisterra,5,49,scopus,,,A

This paper, focusing on such forests, is the first phytosociological study at a national scale in Taiwan. The relevés from the National Vegetation Diversity Inventory and Mapping Project database were used to define vegetation types of the high-mountain coniferous forests and to characterize their distribution in Taiwan. Environmental variables such as aspect, elevation, soil rockiness and slope were related to species composition. Cluster analysis was used to classify vegetation plots and establish groups that were interpreted as nine associations belonging to two alliances. The alliance Juniperion squamatae represents woodlands and forests scattered in the subalpine belt, in which Juniperus squamata dominates the canopy and subalpine meadow species occur in the understorey. The Abieti kawakamii-Tsugion formosanae alliance includes forests dominated by Abies kawakamii and Tsuga chinensis var. formosana with shade-tolerant herb species in the upper montane belt. In addition to regional vegetation description, an identification key for the studied forests was developed based on the classification tree technique. © 2012 Institute of Botany, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.","School of Forestry and Resource Conservation, National Taiwan University, No. 1, Sect. 4, Roosevelt Rd., 10617 Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Botany and Zoology, Masaryk University, Kotlářská 2, 611 37 Brno, Czech Republic; Tokyo University of Agriculture, Faculty of Regional Environmental Science, Sakuragaoka 1-1-1, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo, 156-0054, Japan; Department of Life Sciences, National Chung Hsing University, No. 250, Kuo Kuang Rd., Taichung, Taiwan; Department of Natural Resources, National Ilan University, No. 1, Shen-Lung Rd., Ilan, Taiwan; Institute of Nature Resources, National Dong Hwa University, No. 1, Da-Hsueh Rd., Hualien, Taiwan; Institute of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, National Taiwan University, No. 1, Sect. 4, Roosevelt Rd., Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Biological Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, No. 70, Lien-Hai Rd., Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Department of Life Science, National Taiwan Normal University, No. 88, Ting-Chou Rd., Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Forestry, National Pingtung University of Science and Technology, No. 1, Shue-Fu Rd., Pingtung, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;CZECH REPUBLIC;JAPAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,14,1.0,,"Chiou, C.-R.; School of Forestry and Resource Conservation, No. 1, Sect. 4, Roosevelt Rd., 10617 Taipei, Taiwan; 電子郵件: esclove@ntu.edu.tw","Grantová Agentura České RepublikyGrantová Agentura České Republiky, GA ČR, 505/11/0732, 526/09/H025 National Science CouncilNational Science Council, NSC, 98-2911-I-002-005 Environmental Protection Administration, Executive Yuan, R.O.C.

2018.0,Folia Geobot.,How the diversity abundance size and climbing mechanisms of woody lianas are related to biotic and abiotic factors in a subtropical secondary forest Taiwan,Yang S;Fan H;Li K;Ko T,"Lianas are woody vines that play an important role in forest dynamics in tropical and subtropical areas. Their relationship to various biotic and abiotic conditions is, however, not yet wholly clear. We explored how the size, climbing mechanisms, diversity and abundance of woody lianas is related to host plant size, environmental factors and topography. Liana assemblages were examined in twenty 20 × 20 m plots in each of three topographic sites (valley, slope and ridge) in a subtropical secondary forest in southeastern Taiwan. The valley site had the highest abundance and species richness of lianas. The abiotic factors, soil pH and rock cover, were related to different topographic sites. Larger lianas were always found on larger host trees, while smaller lianas were found in smaller trees; no lianas with a DBH greater than 10 cm were found. Significantly more adhesive lianas were found on larger trees whereas twining and leaning-hook lianas were found in smaller trees. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the species of liana is associated with the size and type of tree growing under different topographic conditions. © 2018, The Author(s).","Department of Forestry, National Pingtung University of Science and Technology, Neipu, Pingtung, Taiwan; Hengchun Ranger Station, Pingtung Forest District Office, Taiwan Forestry Bureau, Hengchun, Pingtung, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,4,1.0,,"Yang, S.-Z.; Department of Forestry, Neipu, Taiwan; 電子郵件: yangsz@mail.npust.edu.tw",,NA NA NA NA,Climbing;  Host tree;  Liana;  Rarefaction;  Species richness;  Topography,10.1007/s12224-017-9306-z,Article,abiotic factor;  abundance;  biotic factor;  forest dynamics;  host plant;  secondary forest;  species diversity;  species richness;  topographic effect;  vine;  woody plant; Taiwan,Springer Netherlands,Folia Geobotanica,12,53,scopus,NATIONAL PINGTUNG UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY;PINGTUNG FOREST DISTRICT OFFICE,DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY,A

Earth Sci.,Longterm risk assessment of possible accidental release of nuclear power plants in complex terrains with respect to synoptic weather patterns,Chang N;Chang D,"This paper presents an integrated effort of a long-term risk analysis for the emergency response of nuclear power plants in complex terrains. Use of coupled source term, fate and transport, and exposure assessment models associated with eight synoptic weather patterns successfully provides timely and reasonably accurate long-range prognostic wind fields to simulate the possible exposure episodes and risk potential. The seamless integration of multi-scale simulation models in accordance with different release scenarios of process source term in the nuclear power plants permits the simulation of pollutant fate, transport, and deposition processes in multiple dimensions of atmospheric environment. With the aid of spatial analysis, the assessment of potential detrimental impacts for the accidental release of various nuclides from nuclear power plants becomes achievable. The practical implementation of this integrated modeling system was assessed by case studies at one existing nuclear power plant in southern Taiwan, China. Two- and three-dimensional fly-through visualization technologies make risk assessment practical and credible based on the differing weather patterns identified at the continental scale in advance.","Univ Cent Florida, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Orlando, FL 32816 USA.;  Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Environm Engn, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.;",USA;TAIWAN,USA,USA,2,2.0,,"Chang, NB (corresponding author), Univ Cent Florida, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Orlando, FL 32816 USA.",Taiwan Power Company,"The authors acknowledge the financial support from Taiwan Power Company and the technical help from Dr. Wei-Guo Soong, and Dr. Hong-Yu Young in the analysis of synoptic weather patterns and Dr. L.C.

Earth Sci.,Disentangling Natural and Anthropogenic Signals in Lacustrine Records An Example from the Ilan Plain NE Taiwan,Huang J;Huh C;Wei K;Lowemark L;Lin S;Liao W;Yang T;Song S;Lee M;Su C;Lee T,"The impact of human activities has been increasing to a degree where humans now outcompete many natural processes. When interpreting environmental and climatic changes recorded in natural archives on historical time scales, it is therefore important to be able to disentangle the relative contribution of natural and anthropogenic processes. Lake Meihua on the Ilan Plain in northeastern Taiwan offers a particularly suitable opportunity to test how human activities known from historical records can be recorded in lacustrine sediment. For this purpose, three cores from Lake Meihua have been studied by a multiproxy approach, providing the first decadal-resolution lacustrine records covering the past 150 years in Taiwan. Profiles of excess Pb-210, Cs-137 and Pu-239,Pu-240 from two short cores (MHL-09-01 and MHL-11-02) allowed a precise chronology to be established. The presence of a yellow, earthy layer with lower levels of organic material coincide with the record of land development associated with the construction of the San-Chin-Gong Temple during AD 19701982. Furthermore, in the lower part of the cores, the upwards increasing trend of inc/coh, TOC, TOC/TN, and grain size, coupled with the palynological data (increase of Alnus, Mallotus, Trema and herbs) from the nearby core MHL-5A with radiocarbon chronology, suggest that the area surrounding the lake has been significantly affected by agricultural activities since the arrival of Chinese settlers around similar to AD 1874. In sum, this study demonstrates that this suite of lacustrine sediments in northeastern Taiwan has recorded human activities in agreement with historical documents, and that different human activities will leave distinct sedimentological, geochemical, and palynological signatures in the sedimentary archives. Therefore, multiproxy reconstructions are important to capture the complex nature of human-environmental interactions. A better understanding of the weathering and erosion response to human activities can also provide useful information for sustainable land-use management.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Acad Sinica, Inst Hist & Philol, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Acad Sinica, Res Ctr Environm Changes, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Acad Sinica, Taiwan Int Grad Program, Earth Syst Sci Program, Taipei, Taiwan.;  CPC Corp, Explorat & Dev Res Inst, Miaoli, Taiwan.;  Univ Taipei, Dept Earth & Life Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, Taipei, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,11,1.0,,"Lowemark, L (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei, Taiwan.","research project ""Environmental Change and Human Activity over the Last 1000 Years in the Lang-Yang River Drainage System: ECHA1000"" [NSC 98-2627-M-002-010]","We are grateful to Miss Yun-Chun Wang, Queenie Chang and Emma Tung for assistance during sample processing and manuscript preparation.

2019.0,Front. Earth Sci.,Crowdsourcing Platform Toward Seismic Disaster Reduction The Taiwan Scientific Earthquake Reporting TSER System,Liang W;Lee J;Hsiao N,"We initiated an earthquake reporting project in 2016 to collect field observations of ground damages caused by large earthquakes from trained volunteers and interested citizens. After a potentially damaging earthquake occurs in the Taiwan area, our system, the Taiwan scientific earthquake reporting system (TSER), would send a notice to the participants, who are encouraged to visit the epicentral area to survey and describe in as much detail as possible the variations of the ground damages using a Usahidi-based mapping platform. They may also upload relevant images in the field when the condition permitted (i.e., good mobile signal). This collective information will be shared with the public after a quick check by the on-duty scientists. Statistically, in Taiwan damaging inland earthquakes, e.g., magnitude greater than 6, occurred every 2-3 years. During the intermittent time, the platform serves to share educational materials such as pictures of geological structures and landscapes, which are beneficial to many of the volunteers, who are high school science teachers. This experimental, science-oriented crowdsourcing system was first tested during the February 6, 2018 Mw 6.4 offshore Hualien, Taiwan earthquake. We received 19 field reports in the first 3 days after the earthquake. Most of these reports provided surface damage details along the Milun fault, which also ruptured during the 1951 ML 7.1 Longitudinal Valley earthquake sequence. The crowdsourcing approach of TSER has proven to be effective in enhancing public awareness and the potential for scientific advancement in hazard mitigation.","Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Cent Weather Bur, Seismol Ctr, Taipei, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,1.0,"Liang, WT (corresponding author), Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.","""Disaster Resiliency through Big Open Data and Smart Things, DRBoast"" project (Academia Sinica) [AS-105-SS-A03]; Taiwan Earthquake Research Center program (TEC) (Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan, MOST) [MOST 106-2119-M-001-021, 107-2116-M-001-023]","This work was supported in part by the ""Disaster Resiliency through Big Open Data and Smart Things, DRBoast"" project (Grant No.: AS-105-SS-A03) (Funding Agency: Academia Sinica), as well as the Taiwan Earthquake Research Center program (TEC) (Grant Nos.: MOST 106-2119-M-001-021 and 107-2116-M-001-023; TEC Contribution Number for this article is 00148) (Funding Agency: Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan, MOST).

2020.0,Front. Earth Sci.,An Idealized Landslide Failure Surface and Its Impacts on the Traveling Paths,Tai Y;Ko C;Li K;Wu Y;Kuo C;Chen R;Lin C,"Numerical scenario simulation may serve as an efficient and powerful tool for hazard assessment, but it often suffers from the lack of a definite failure surface before the occurrence of failure. In the present study, an idealized curved surface (ICS) is proposed for mimicking the sliding surface in the numerical simulation. Different from the conventional Sloping Local Base Level (SLBL) or Scoops3D method, this idealized surface consists of two curvatures, which are defined in the down-slope and cross-slope directions, respectively. Applying this idealized surface to 45 historical landslides of sliding type in southern Taiwan, two specific relations of geometry (length, curvature radius, and depth) in the down-slope and cross-slope directions are figured out. These specific relations simplify the complexity of constructing the idealized curved surface for areas prone to landslides for the sake of hazard assessments. That is, once the area with landslide susceptibility is identified and the associated released volume is given, the idealized sliding surface can be uniquely determined with the help of these geometric relations. The proposed method is integrated with a two-phase grain-fluid model and numerically validated against a historical large-scale landslide for investigating its feasibility. Although the idealized failure surface may deviate from that determined by the post-event investigation, it is interesting to note that the major discrepancy is mainly found at the first stage. The differences (both flow thickness and paths) reduce over time, and only minor discrepancies can be identified at the deposition stage. These findings reveal the weak co-relation between the geometry of the failure surface and the flow paths. It also indicates the feasibility of the ICS for predicting the flow paths by scenario investigation, especially when the exact sliding surface of a landslide is not available.","Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Hydraul & Ocean Engn, Tainan, Taiwan.;  Acad Sinica, Ctr Appl Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Chinese Culture Univ, Dept Geol, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Tainan, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,7,1.0,1.0,"Tai, YC (corresponding author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Hydraul & Ocean Engn, Tainan, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and Technology, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 108-2221-E-006-015]; Soil and Water Conservation Bureau, Council of Agriculture, Taiwan [SWCB-108-235]","The financial support of the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan (MOST 108-2221-E-006-015) and the Soil and Water Conservation Bureau, Council of Agriculture, Taiwan (SWCB-108-235) were acknowledged.",landslide; slope failure; failure surface; idealized curved surface (ICS); flow paths; hazard assessment,10.3389/feart.2020.00313,Article,WENCHUAN EARTHQUAKE; STABILITY; MODEL; TOPOGRAPHY; TAIWAN,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE,1,8,ISI,NATL CHENG KUNG UNIV;ACAD SINICA;CHINESE CULTURE UNIV;NATL CHENG KUNG UNIV,NATL CHENG KUNG UNIV,B2
2020.0,Front. Earth Sci.,Application Assessments of Using Scarp BoundaryFitted Volume Constrained Smooth Minimal Surfaces as Failure Interfaces of DeepSeated Landslides,Kuo C;Tsai P;Tai Y;Chan Y;Chen R;Lin C,"More than 9,000 potential deep-seated landslide sites in the mountain ranges of Taiwan have been identified by a series of renewed governmental hazard mitigation initiatives after the 2009 Morakot typhoon. Among these sites, 186 sites have protection targets where thorough mitigation strategies are to be implemented. One of the important tasks in the hazard mitigation initiative is to estimate the volume, failure interface and related quantities of each landslide site. In addition, with this number of sites, an automated tool is needed to generate predictions at low operational costs. We propose to use volume-constrained smooth minimal surfaces to approximate the landslide failure interfaces. A volume-constrained smooth minimal surface in the current context is defined as a differentiable surface that encloses a given landslide volume with the minimal surface area. Although the stratigraphy and geological structures are omitted, the smooth minimal surface method is verified with 24 known landslides and is shown to be able to generate acceptable, approximated failure interfaces. A collection of assessment indices is employed to measure the fitness of the predictions. Finally, the prediction fitness vs. the landslide scarp geometry is investigated.","Acad Sinica, Res Ctr Appl Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Math, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Hydraul & Ocean Engn, Tainan, Taiwan.;  Chinese Culture Univ, Dept Geol, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Tainan, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,6,1.0,1.0,"Kuo, CY (corresponding author), Acad Sinica, Res Ctr Appl Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and Technology [MOST-106-2625-M-001-001-]; Soil and Water Conservation Bureau, of Taiwan, Republic of China [SWCB-108-10.10.1-S4]","This work was supported in parts by grant no.

2020.0,Front. Earth Sci.,Citizen Seismology in Taiwan Development Outreach and Formative Assessment of NearReal Time Earthquake Game Competition Activities,Chen K;Liang W;Lin C;Wu L,"Citizen seismology encourages the public involvement in data collection, analysis, and reporting, and has the potential to greatly improve the emergency response to seismic hazard. We believe in the value of citizen seismology and started with distributing Quake-Catcher Network (QCN) sensors at schools in Taiwan. Unlike most of western countries, Earth Sciences is a required course in junior and senior high schools of Taiwan (Ministry of Education, 2014). Low-cost seismometer is potentially a powerful tool in classrooms to teach earthquake science, which makes school teachers our targeted users. We work closely with school teachers and students to understand how a citizen seismology project can help them to encourage successful engagement. In this study, we establish the achievements gained and problems encountered in different phases of the project since 2013. The main tasks carried out here include (1) refinement of Citizen Seismology Literacy (CSL) into three dimensions: Awareness, and Willingness, and Technology fluency (2) development of an interactive competition platform called the Near-Real Time Earthquake Game Competition (EGCnrt) that allows citizen seismologists to report earthquake information by processing P- and S-wave arrivals, peak ground motion, and first motion of P-waves for every inlandM(L)>= 4 earthquake in Taiwan; (3) development of the formative assessment for the 1.5 h long, non-lecture-based game activities. Based on 565 student surveys completed after our 2016 summer outreach activity, we found that all three CSL dimensions have an influence on students' score in the training activity. The final score in EGCnrt is also found to significantly correlate with the performance in the training sections. We therefore, propose that the CSL can act as a powerful indicator for the performance and engagement in earthquake learning activities. The game-based, non-lecture-based learning approach can be effective in promoting citizen seismology in the future.","Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Nankang, Taiwan.;  Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Grad Sch Educ, Taoyuan, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,4,1.0,,"Wu, LY (corresponding author), Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Grad Sch Educ, Taoyuan, Taiwan.","MOST grant [108-2116-M-003-006-MY3, 108-2511-H-033-003-MY2]",Support for this work was provided by MOST grant 108-2116-M-003-006-MY3 and 108-2511-H-033-003-MY2.,citizen seismology; QCN; earthquake game; citizen seismology literacy; formative assessment,10.3389/feart.2020.00154,Article,INFORMATION; NETWORK; SCIENCE; PERFORMANCE; ENGAGEMENT,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE,0,8,ISI,NATL TAIWAN NORMAL UNIV;INST EARTH SCI;CHUNG YUAN CHRISTIAN UNIV,CHUNG YUAN CHRISTIAN UNIV,A

The significance of these observations is investigated using data sets of recentM >= 6.0 earthquakes around the Taiwan area from 2009 to 2019. We suggest that the precursory signal could be anE(Index)anomaly (EA) in the form of substantial thermal releases distributed near the epicenter. The consecutive appearances of OLR EAs are observed as precursors 2-15 days before significant earthquakes, and we refer to this as a pre-earthquake OLR E(Index)anomaly (POEA). We interpret these thermal sources as possibly originating from electromagnetics together with gas emissions associated with pre-seismic processes. This study highlights the potential of OLR anomalous changes in earthquake precursor studies, at least in the Taiwan region.","Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Chapman Univ, Schmid Coll Sci & Technol Phys Computat Sci & Eng, Orange, CA USA.;  Cent Weather Bur, Marine Meteorol Ctr, Taipei, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;USA;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,4,1.0,1.0,"Fu, CC (corresponding author), Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST)Ministry of Science and Technology, China [MOST 108-2116-M-002-025, MOST 108-2116-M-001-024]; Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan [MOTC-CWB-108-E-01]",The research was supported by Grants MOST 108-2116-M-002-025 and MOST 108-2116-M-001-024 through the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) and MOTC-CWB-108-E-01 from the Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan.,National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; outgoing longwave radiation; pre-earthquake OLR E-Index anomaly; earthquake precursor; Taiwan,10.3389/feart.2020.00364,Article,1999 CHI-CHI; ROBUST SATELLITE TECHNIQUES; SEISMICALLY ACTIVE AREAS; GROUNDWATER LEVEL; PRONE AREAS; INFRARED RADIATION; TEMPORAL VARIATION; MAJOR EARTHQUAKES; THERMAL ANOMALIES; ALLUVIAL-FAN,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE,4,8,ISI,INST EARTH SCI;CHAPMAN UNIV;MARINE METEOROL CTR,INST EARTH SCI,B1
2020.0,Front. Earth Sci.,Structural Evolution of Extended Continental Crust Deciphered From the Cretaceous Batholith in SE China a Kinmen Island Perspective,Huang T;Yeh M,"The continental crust of southeast Asia underwent from thickening, thinning to almost rifting during the Mesozoic era as the active continental margin transformed into a passive one. Such crustal thinning history is well-preserved in the Kinmen Island, as the lower crustal granitoids retrograded and rapidly exhumed to surface that were crosscutted by mafic dike swarm. Kinmen Island is situated on the SE coast of Asia, featured by the widespread Cretaceous magmatism as the Paleo-Pacific plate subducted and rollbacked underneath the South China block. Although these complex magmatism are well reported and studied, their associated structural evolution and plate kinematics have not been clearly deciphered. Detailed field mapping, structural measurement, and petrographic analysis of the Kinmen Island were conducted. Up to five deformation events accompanied with five relevant magmatic episodes as well as their corresponding kinematic setting are reconstructed. The ∼129 Ma Chenggong Tonalite (G1) preserved all deformation events identified in this study, which marks the lower bound timing of all reported events. D1 formed a gneiss dome with the Taiwushan Granite (∼139 Ma) at the core bounded by moderately dipping gneissic foliation (S1) as crust extended. D2 formed subhorizontal S-tectonite (S2) with further exhumation of D1 gneiss dome due to middle-to-lower crustal flow associated with further crustal thinning. D3 formed a sinistral ENE-WSW striking steeply S dipping shear belts with well-developed S/C/C’ fabrics. The moderately E-plunging lineation on C surface indicates its transtensional nature. Widespread garnet-bearing leucogranite (G2) associated with decompressional melting showed long lasting intrusion prior to D2 until post D3. D4 was the intrusion of biotite-bearing Tienpu Granite (∼100 Ma; G3) that truncated G1, G2, and all fabrics, which was followed by the intrusion of E-W striking, steeply dipping biotite-bearing pegmatite (G4) as the crust further extended. The youngest deformation event (D5) was NE-SW striking subvertical mafic dike swarm (G5; 90–76 Ma) due to mantle upwelling through significantly thinned crust. By integrating the structural evolution and the previously reported strain pattern, we delineate the slab rollback direction of the Paleo-pacific plate, which changed from northeastward (129∼114 Ma) to southeastward (107∼76 Ma). This plate kinematic movement switched during 114–107 Ma. © Copyright © 2020 Huang and Yeh.","Department of Geosciences, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Earth Sciences, National Taiwan Normal University, Taipei, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,1.0,"Yeh, M.W.; Department of Earth Sciences, Taiwan; 電子郵件: marywyeh@ntnu.edu.tw","Ministry of Science and Technology, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST, 105WFA0350331, 107-2813-C-002-113-M",This research received funding support from the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan under project ID: 105WFA0350331 and 107-2813-C-002-113-M.

2020.0,Front. Earth Sci.,Surface Ocean Hydrographic Changes in the Western Pacific Marginal Seas Since the Early Holocene,Pan H;Chen M;Kong D;Lin X;Wong K;Tsai H;Liu S;Shi X;Yokoyama Y,"Climatic changes in the western Pacific marginal seas are influenced by global forcing and regional processes, including monsoons, and ocean circulation. To better understand the process of hydrographic and temperature changes, we applied the U-37(K') as our index of Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and TEX86 as the index of Subsurface Water Temperature (SWT) for the last 8400 years using the sediment core MZ01 from the continental shelf of the East China Sea (ECS). To focus on centennial and millennial variabilities, the original SST and SWT are filtered with the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) of the Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT), with the confidence defined by a new method, the Continuity Superposition Error Calculation Method (CSECM). The SST and SWT both have a quasi-period of 1000-2000 years, exhibiting some teleconnection with the north Atlantic climatic changes. The SWT decreased during approximately 6-4 ka and then increased by similar to 4 degrees C to the late Holocene, almost anti-phase with the SST. The stronger Asian winter monsoon and China Coastal Current (CCC), are very likely responsible for the decreased SST in the late Holocene. In contrast, the increased SWT may imply that the stronger CCC has brought more Changjiang Diluted Water (CDW) southward and formed a thicker barrier layer in the ECS, which dampened bottom water heat loss that was transported from the Taiwan Warm Current (TWC), and Western Kuroshio Branch Current (WKBC). This process is tested by the hosing experiment that supports stronger stratification when the north Atlantic cooled. The combined results by U-37(K') and TEX86 provide a new insight into the interaction mechanism among the winter monsoon, precipitation and the Kuroshio Current, and also raises caution to take more regional factors into account in the application of TEX66.","Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Coll Ocean Sci & Resource, Inst Earth Sci, Keelung, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Coll Engn, Ctr Excellence Ocean Engn, Keelung, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Ctr Excellence Oceans, Keelung, Taiwan.;  Guangdong Ocean Univ, Coll Ocean & Meteorol, Lab Coastal Ocean Variat & Disaster Predict, Zhanjiang, Peoples R China.;  Ocean Univ China, Coll Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Key Lab Phys Oceanog, Qingdao, Peoples R China.;  Minist Econ Affairs, Cent Geol Survey, New Taipei, Taiwan.;  State Ocean Adm, Inst Oceanog 1, Key Lab Marine Sedimentol & Environm Geol, Qingdao, Peoples R China.;  Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Marine Geol, Qingdao, Peoples R China.;  Univ Tokyo, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, Kashiwa, Chiba, Japan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;CHINA;CHINA;TAIWAN;CHINA;CHINA;JAPAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,9,1.0,,"Pan, HJ; Chen, MT (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Coll Ocean Sci & Resource, Inst Earth Sci, Keelung, Taiwan.; Chen, MT (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Coll Engn, Ctr Excellence Ocean Engn, Keelung, Taiwan.; Chen, MT (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Ctr Excellence Oceans, Keelung, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and Technology, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 108-2116-M-019-004, MOST 108-2116-M-019-008-MY2]","This study was supported by the research projects MOST 108-2116-M-019-004 and MOST 108-2116-M-019-008-MY2 from the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.",East China Sea; U-37(K&PRIME); TEX80; Sea Surface Temperature; East Asia Monsoon; Kuroshio; Hilbert Huang Transform; Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition,10.3389/feart.2020.00200,Article,EAST CHINA SEA; INTERTROPICAL CONVERGENCE ZONE; ISOPRENOID TETRAETHER LIPIDS; WINTER MONSOON; WATER TEMPERATURE; INNER SHELF; YELLOW SEA; SUMMER; VARIABILITY; CIRCULATION,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE,0,8,ISI,NATL TAIWAN OCEAN UNIV;NATL TAIWAN OCEAN UNIV;NATL TAIWAN OCEAN UNIV;GUANGDONG OCEAN UNIV;OCEAN UNIV CHINA;QINGDAO;QINGDAO NATL LAB MARINE SCI AND TECHNOL;UNIV TOKYO,NATL TAIWAN OCEAN UNIV;NATL TAIWAN OCEAN UNIV;NATL TAIWAN OCEAN UNIV,A

Here we present an integrated analysis of a decade of GNSS/acoustic data collected at a site 60 km to the east of northeast Taiwan near the axis of the Okinawa Trough back-arc basin. We obtained a time-series of horizontal and vertical positions based on 18 measurements from 2009 to 2019. These data reveal a southeastward movement at a rate of 43 +/- 5 mm/yr since 2012 with respect to the Yangtze Plate. The horizontal motion can be explained by the clockwise rotation of the Yonaguni Block and northern Central Range. In addition, the vertical displacement of the transponder array shows rapid subsidence of 22 +/- 9 mm/yr from 2012 to 2019. The fast subsidence rate and negative free-air gravity anomaly in this region indicate that crustal thinning is compensated mainly by surface deformation rather than upward migration of the Moho. Taking into account the offset in 2012 owing to the replacement of the transponder array, the horizontal position time series of our site are best explained by two linear lines with a slope change in July 2013. The timing of the velocity change coincides broadly with a change in the nearby seismicity rate and dike intrusion 150 km away from the site. Our results highlight the potential of seafloor geodesy in assessing temporal changes in deformation near the spreading center of the Okinawa Trough, which cannot be one using data from onland GNSS stations.","Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Shizuoka Univ, Fac Sci, Sakai, Osaka, Japan.;  Osaka Prefecture Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Aerosp Engn, Sakai, Osaka, Japan.;",TAIWAN;JAPAN;JAPAN,TAIWAN,JAPAN,12,1.0,,"Ikuta, R (corresponding author), Shizuoka Univ, Fac Sci, Sakai, Osaka, Japan.","Ministry of Science and Technology in TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST109-2116M-001-009, MOST108-2116-M-001-022]; Institute of Earth Sciences Academia SinicaAcademia Sinica - Taiwan","3D coordinates of the onland GNSS stations in Japan were downloaded from the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan (https://terras.gsi.go.jp/).GNSS station position in Taiwan andGPS phase data for fiducial stations were provided by the Institute of Earth Science, Academia Sinica (http://gps.earth.sinica.edu.tw/).Hypocenter data around Japan was provided by Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA).

Earth Sci.,An Automatic System for Continuous Monitoring and Sampling of Groundwater Geochemistry in EarthquakeProne Regions of SW Taiwan,Fu C;Lai C;Yang T;Hilton D;Chen C;Walia V;Kumar A;Lee L,"Previous studies have revealed that gas compositions of fluid samples collected from southwestern Taiwan, where many hot springs and mud volcanoes are distributed along with tectonic structures, show significant variation before and after some disaster seismic events. Such variations, including radon activity, CH4/CO2, and He-3/He-4 ratios of gas compositions, are considered precursors of earthquakes in this area. An automatic system for continuous on-line gas monitoring and groundwater sampling was established at Yun-Shui (YS), where an artesian well located at an active fault zone in SW Taiwan, to validate the relationship between fluid compositions and seismicity. It is equipped with a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS) and a radon detector for in-situ measurement of the dissolved gas composition. Variations of dissolved gas compositions are transmitted to the laboratory through the internet. Furthermore, a syringe pump apparatus for the retrieval and temporal analysis of helium (SPARTAH) is also installed for off-line laboratory analysis for obtaining the detailed time-series records of helium, hydrogen, oxygen, and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) isotopic compositions as well as dissolved inorganic carbon and chloride concentration of water samples at this station. After continuous monitoring for several months, two substantial anomalies of multiparameter were observed prior to the significant earthquakes. This automated system has been demonstrated to be feasible for long-term continuous seismo-geochemical research in this area.","Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Univ Calif San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.;  NARL, Natl Ctr Res Earthquake Engn, Taipei, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;USA;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,8,1.0,1.0,"Fu, CC (corresponding author), Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST)Ministry of Science and Technology, China [MOST 108-2116-M-002-025, MOST 108-2116-M-001-024, MOST 109-2628-M-001-002-MY3]","The research is supported by grants MOST 108-2116-M-002-025, MOST 108-2116-M-001-024, and MOST 109-2628-M-001-002-MY3 through the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST).",on-line gas monitoring; syringe pump apparatus for the retrieval and temporal analysis of helium; off-line laboratory analysis; multiparameter; seismo-geochemical research,10.3389/feart.2021.635913,Article,,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE,0,9,ISI,INST EARTH SCI;NATL TAIWAN UNIV;UNIV CALIF SAN DIEGO;NATL CTR RES EARTHQUAKE ENGN,INST EARTH SCI,B2
2021.0,Front. Earth Sci.,Clustered Stacked and Imbricated Large Coastal Rock Clasts on Ludao Island Southeast Taiwan and Their Application to Palaeotyphoon Intensity Assessment,Terry J;Lau A;Nguyen K;Liou Y;Switzer A,"This work investigated the characteristics of a boulder field on the exposed south east coast of Ludao Island (Green Island) in southern Taiwan. Although the region regularly experiences seasonal Pacific typhoons, fieldwork on Ludao was prompted following the double-strike of Typhoon Tembin in August 2012, which followed an unusual looping track and was one of the strongest storms to affect the island in recent decades. In Wen Cuen Bay, large limestone and volcanic clasts (10(3)-10(5) kg) occur both as isolated individuals and also grouped into distinct clusters across the gently-sloping emerged reef platform of Holocene age. Some individuals reach megaclast proportions. Observations revealed limited evidence for the production of new coastal boulders by Typhoon Tembin. However, clustering, stacking and notable imbrication of old large clasts provide evidence for multiple high-energy palaeoevents. Stacking and imbrication are significant depositional features, implying that (partial) lifting by wave transport was responsible. Boulders deposited by Typhoon Tembin suggest that storm produced minimum flow velocities of 3.2-5.1 m/s. This range of minimum flow velocity (MFV) values is lower than the 4.3-13.8 m/s range inferred from the pre-Tembin boulders, which indicates that older storm washovers must have been stronger, judging from their ability to stack and imbricate large clasts. One explanation for high upper values of palaeoevent MFVs is that localized funnelling of water flow through narrow relict channels (inherited spur-and-groove morphology, oriented perpendicular to the modern reef edge) concentrates onshore flow energy into powerful confined jets. Support for this hypothesis is the positioning and train-of-direction of the main imbricated boulder cluster at the landward head of one such feature. Geomorphic controls amplifying wave-driven flow velocities across the emerged Holocene reef mean that a palaeotyphoon origin is sufficient for explaining large clast stacking and imbrication, without the need to invoke a tsunami hypothesis.","Zayed Univ, Coll Nat & Hlth Sci, Dubai, U Arab Emirates.;  Univ Queensland, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.;  Natl Cent Univ, Ctr Space & Remote Sensing Res, Taoyuan, Taiwan.;  Nanyang Technol Univ, Asian Sch Environm, Singapore, Singapore.;  Nanyang Technol Univ, Earth Observ Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.;",U ARAB EMIRATES;AUSTRALIA;TAIWAN;SINGAPORE;SINGAPORE,U ARAB EMIRATES,U ARAB EMIRATES,5,3.0,2.0,"Terry, JP (corresponding author), Zayed Univ, Coll Nat & Hlth Sci, Dubai, U Arab Emirates.",National University of Singapore (ARF grant) [FY2012-FRC2-005]; Zayed University (RIF grant) [R19088]; National University of SingaporeNational University of Singapore; Earth Observatory of Singapore (EOS) at Nanyang Technological University,& nbsp;JT acknowledges research support from the National University of Singapore (ARF grant FY2012-FRC2-005) and Zayed University (RIF grant R19088).

The dynamic processes of onsite rock/soil mechanics could be revealed via monitoring using the electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) technique and Archie's law. This study aims to investigate water saturation changes over time using time-lapse ERT images, providing a powerful method for monitoring landslide events. A fully automatic remote resistivity monitoring system was deployed to acquire hourly electrical resistivity data using a nontraditional hybrid array in the Lantai area of Yilan Taiping Mountain in Northeast Taiwan from 2019 to 2021. Six subzones in borehole ERT images were examined for the temporal and spatial resistivity variations, as well as possible pathways of the groundwater. Two representative cases of inverted electrical resistivity images varying with precipitation may be correlated with water saturation changes in the studied hillslope, implying the process of rainfall infiltration. Layers with decreased and increased electrical resistivity are also observed before sliding events. Accordingly, we suggest that high-frequency time-lapse ERT monitoring could play a crucial role in landslide early warning.","Natl Cent Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Taoyuan, Taiwan.;  Natl Cent Univ, Earthquake Disaster & Risk Evaluat & Management C, Taoyuan, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Inst Earth Sci, Keelung, Taiwan.;  Natl Cent Univ, Grad Inst Hydrol & Ocean Sci, Taoyuan, Taiwan.;  Acad Sinica, Res Ctr Appl Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Natl Chi Nan Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Nantou, Taiwan.;  Natl Taipei Univ Technol, Dept Mat & Mineral Resources Engn, Taipei, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,8,1.0,1.0,"Chiang, CW (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Inst Earth Sci, Keelung, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and Technology, R.O.C.; Soil and Water Conservation Bureau Council of Agriculture, Executive Yuan, R.O.C.

2021.0,Front. Earth Sci.,Hydrogeochemistry and Acidic Property of Submarine Groundwater Discharge Around Two Coral Islands in the Northern South China Sea,Lui H;Liu M;Lin H;Tseng H;Liu L;Wang F;Hou W;Chang R;Chen C,"Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) is an important source of nutrients in many coastal regions, yet little information is available on its carbonate chemistry and controlling factors. This study examined the processes and factors controlling the hydrogeochemistry and acidic property of the groundwaters and SGD waters of two isolated coral islands, Liuqiu Island (13 km off southwestern Taiwan) and Dongsha Island (located in the northern South China Sea, 420 km away from Liuqiu Island). Our results showed that the total alkalinity and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) of the fresh SGD waters were controlled mainly by the chemical weathering of carbonate minerals. Part of the DIC came from the organic matter decomposition or soil CO2, reducing the pH and CO3 (2-) concentration. Distributions of the carbonate chemistry and nutrients of the SGD waters were controlled mainly by physical mixing between the groundwater and the ambient seawater under the seabed, the so-called subterranean estuary. The Ca2+ released through weathering significantly increased the saturation state of aragonite or calcite, reducing the corrosiveness of the SGD waters on the carbonate rocks. This study is likely the first to examine the effects of the acidic property of SGD waters on the biogenic carbonate spine of a sea urchin and a pteropod shell. The spring water with similar carbonate chemistry to that of the freshwater SGD endmember from Liuqiu Island with a saturation state of aragonite of 0.96 caused observable dissolution on the spine of a sea urchin and a pteropod shell, but the spine dissolved more readily. This was because the spine is made of high-Mg calcite, which has higher solubility than that of aragonite or calcite. Such a result implies that some marine organisms with carbonate skeletons or shells containing high Mg:Ca ratios may suffer the impact of ocean acidification earlier. Although the SGD may contribute less than 10% of freshwater discharge by rivers to the coastal area, its impact on coastal biogeochemical cycles and ecosystems due to its acidic property and continual effect on the coast all year round deserves further investigation.","Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Oceanog, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.;  Natl Appl Res Labs, Taiwan Ocean Res Inst, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.;  Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Marine Biotechnol & Resources, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Inst Marine Environm & Ecol, Keelung, Taiwan.;  Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Frontier Ctr Ocean Sci & Technol, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,9,1.0,,"Lui, HK; Chen, CTA (corresponding author), Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Oceanog, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and Technology of TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 107-2611-M-110-026-, MOST 108-2611-M-110-025, MOST 109-2611-M-110-010, MOST 109-2611-M-110-016, MOST 110-2611-M-110-024]","This research was funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan (MOST 107-2611-M-110-026-, MOST 108-2611-M-110-025, MOST 109-2611-M-110-010, MOST 109-2611-M-110-016, MOST 110-2611-M-110-024).",Dongsha; Liuqiu; ocean acidifcation; pH; saturation state of CaCO; chemical weathering; geochemistry; SGD,10.3389/feart.2021.697388,Article,PTEROPOD LIMACINA-HELICINA; OCEAN ACIDIFICATION; CARBON-DIOXIDE; NITROUS-OXIDE; COASTAL; TEMPERATURES; CHEMISTRY; ARAGONITE; SEAWATER; CALCITE,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE,0,9,ISI,NATL SUN YAT SEN UNIV;TAIWAN OCEAN RES INST;NATL SUN YAT SEN UNIV;NATL TAIWAN OCEAN UNIV;NATL SUN YAT SEN UNIV,NATL SUN YAT SEN UNIV,A
2021.0,Front. Earth Sci.,Onsite Early Prediction of PGA Using CNN With MultiScale and MultiDomain PWaves as Input,Hsu T;Huang C,"Although convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been applied successfully to many fields, the onsite earthquake early warning by CNN remains unexplored. This study aims to predict the peak ground acceleration (PGA) of the incoming seismic waves using CNN, which is achieved by analyzing the first 3 s of P-wave data collected from a single site. Because the amplitude of P-wave data of large and small earthquakes can differ, the multi-scale input of P-wave data is proposed in this study in order to let the CNN observe the input data in different scales. Both the time and frequency domains of the P-wave data are combined into multi-domain input, and therefore the CNN can observe the data from different aspects. Since only the maximum absolute acceleration value of the time history of seismic waves is the target output of the CNN, the absolute value of the P-wave time history data is used instead of the raw value. The proposed arrangement of the input data shows its superiority to the one directly inputting the raw P-wave data into the CNN. Moreover, the predicted PGA accuracy using the proposed CNN approach is higher than the one using the support vector regression approach that employed the extracted P-wave features as its input. The proposed CNN approach also shows that the accuracy of the predicted PGA and the alert performances are acceptable based on data from two independent and damaging earthquakes.","Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Taipei, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,1.0,"Hsu, TY (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Taipei, Taiwan.",Taiwan Building Technology Center from The Featured Areas Research Center Program within the framework of the Higher Education Sprout Project by the Ministry of Education in Taiwan,This research is partially supported by the Taiwan Building Technology Center from The Featured Areas Research Center Program within the framework of the Higher Education Sprout Project by the Ministry of Education in Taiwan.,PGA; CNN; on-site earthquake early warning; multi-scale; single station,10.3389/feart.2021.626908,Article,EARLY WARNING SYSTEM; NEURAL-NETWORKS; EARTHQUAKES; PARAMETERS; DISTANCE; TAIWAN,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE,0,9,ISI,NATL TAIWAN UNIV SCI AND TECHNOL,NATL TAIWAN UNIV SCI AND TECHNOL,B1
2009.0,Front. Earth Sci. China,Assessment of the impact of biogenic VOC emissions in a high ozone episode via integrated remote sensing and the CMAQ model,Cheng K;Chang N,"In many metropolitan regions, natural sources contribute a substantial fraction of volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions. These biogenic VOC emissions are precursors to tropospheric Ozone (O3) formation. Because forests make up 59% of the land area in Taiwan Province, China, the biogenic VOC emissions from forests and farmland could play an important role in photochemical reactions. On the other hand, anthropogenic emissions might also be one of the major inputs for ground level O3 concentrations. Hence, emission inventory data, grouped as point, area, mobile and biogenic VOC sources, are a composite of reported and estimated pollutant emission information and are used by many air quality models to simulate ground level O3 concentrations. Before using relevant air quality models, the emission inventory data generally require huge amounts of processing for spatial, temporal, and species congruence with respect to the associated air quality modeling work. The fist part of this research applied satellite remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) analyses to characterize land use/land cover (LULC) patterns, integrating various sources of anthropogenic emissions and biogenic emissions associated with a variety of plant species. To investigate the significance of biogenic VOC emissions on ozone formation, meteorological and air quality modeling were then employed to generate hourly ozone estimates for a case study of a high ozone episode in southern Taiwan, which is the leading industrial hub on the island. To enhance the modeling accuracy, a unique software module, SMOKE, was set up for emission processing to prepare emission inputs for the U.S. EPA's Models-3/CMAQ. An emission inventory of Taiwan, TEDS 4.2, was used as the anthropogenic emission inventory. Biogenic emission modeling was accomplished by BEIS-2 in SMOKE, with improvement of local LULC data and revised emission factors. Research findings show that the majority of biogenic VOC emissions occur in the mountainous areas and farmlands. However, the modeling outputs show that downwind of the most heavily populated and industrialized areas, these biogenic VOC emissions have less impact on air quality than do anthropogenic emissions. © Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH 2009.","Environmental Laboratory, SGS Taiwan LTD., Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL 32816, United States",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;USA,TAIWAN,USA,2,1.0,,"Chang, N.-B.; Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, , Orlando, FL 32816, United States; 電子郵件: nchang@mail.ucf.edu",,NA NA NA,Air pollution;  Air quality modeling;  Biogenic emissions;  Ozone;  Remote sensing;  Volatile organic compounds,10.1007/s11707-009-0019-3,Article,air quality;  assessment method;  atmospheric pollution;  biogenic emission;  emission inventory;  integrated approach;  ozone;  remote sensing;  source apportionment;  volatile organic compound; Taiwan,Higher Education Press,Frontiers of Earth Science in China,1,3,scopus,ENVIRONMENTAL LABORATORY;UNIVERSITY OF CENTRAL FLORIDA,DEPARTMENT OF CIVIL AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING,A

For this reason, we map high-potential areas of ILP within the Soil and water conservation zone (SWCZ) as an aid for effective land management and conducted an exploratory analysis of explanatory variables to evaluate their variability within ILP hot spots. We used variables relevant to hot spots to develop a logistic regression model and identified seven statistically significant variables. We re-applied the logistic regression approach to produce spatially explicit predictions of ILP. High probability areas are distributed along the coastal regions, covering 26% of the SWCZ, and their major drivers are related to accessibility and topography. The results from this research provide relevant information on the major drivers of ILP and high-potential areas, which can support officials in monitoring efforts for better planning and governance within the SWCZ.","Natl Cent Univ, Ctr Space & Remote Sensing Res, Taoyuan, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geog, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Natl Cent Univ, Dept Management Informat Syst, Taoyuan, Taiwan.;  Council Agr, Soil & Water Conservat Bur, Nantou, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,7,1.0,,"Chiang, SH (corresponding author), Natl Cent Univ, Ctr Space & Remote Sensing Res, Taoyuan, Taiwan.","National Land Surveying and Mapping Center, Ministry of the Interior, Taiwan [NLSC-105-6]","This work was supported by National Land Surveying and Mapping Center, Ministry of the Interior, Taiwan [grant number NLSC-105-6].",Illegal land use change practices; spatial modelling; hot spots; land use change detection system; soil and water conservation zone,10.1080/10106049.2017.1374474,Article,COVER CHANGE; CELLULAR-AUTOMATA; DEFORESTATION; PREDICTION; OPTIMIZATION; PATTERNS; AREAS,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL,2,34,ISI,NATL CENT UNIV;NATL TAIWAN UNIV;NATL CENT UNIV;COUNCIL AGR,NATL CENT UNIV,A

,Geocarto Int.,From land cover to land use Applying random forest classifier to Landsat imagery for urban landuse change mapping,Shih H;Stow D;Chang K;Roberts D;Goulias K,"The extensive record of Landsat imagery is commonly used to map urban land-cover and land-use change. Random forest (RF) classification was applied for mapping more detailed urban land-use and change categories than is typically attempted with Landsat data. Two dates of Landsat imagery (1990 and 2015) were utilized with surface reflectance, Vegetation-Impervious-Soil (V-I-S) fractions, grey-level cooccurrence matrix (GLCM) of V-I-S, and temporal variation of V-I-S inputs.

1997.0,Geochem. J.,Acidification of lakes and reservoirs in Taiwan,Chen C;Wang B,"One hundred forty three lakes, ponds and reservoirs in Taiwan and the offshore islands Penghu (Pescadores), Kinmen (Quemoy), Matsu, Hsioliuchiu, Lutao and Lanyu have been investigated in the past few years. Hereafter, the term lake is generally used for the three bodies of water discussed. According to the rock and soil compositions, the authors divided Taiwan into three regions. Zone I consists mainly of igneous rocks with lakes generally of low buffering capacity and low pH. Zone LI consists mainly of noncalcareous sedimentary and metamorphic rocks with lakes of varying buffering capacity and pH. Those at high elevations generally have low buffering capacity and pH but many at low elevations have high alkalinity and pH. Zone III consists mostly of gravel, sand, clay, limestone and the alluvium zone with lakes of high buffering capacity and pH. About 27% of the lakes have low alkalinity and are mostly located in Zones I and II. These lakes are more threatened by acid rain and many indeed are acidic. They are mostly alpine and subalpine lakes or are located near the Tatun and Keelung volcano groups. The NTA (normalized total alkalinity) is used as an acidification index. The decrease of the NTA for Lovers Lake, Yuen-Yang Lake, Carp Lake (Hualien County) and Little Ghost Lake suggested acidification. The other Lakes' NTA mostly remained constant. We also measured the concentrations of 53 chemical species: Ag, Al, Au, B, Ba, Be, Bi, Ca, Cd, C2H5COO-, Cl-, Co, Cr, Cu, Dy, Er, Eu, Fe, Gd, Ge, HCO3-, Hg, In, K, Lu, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Nb, Nd, Ni, NO3-, NO2-, Pb, Pd, PO4-3, Pr, Sc, Si, Sm, Sr, SO4-2, Ta, Tb, Te, Ti, Tm, V, Y, Yb, Zn and Zr in lake water samples.

1998.0,Geochem. J.,Distribution and enrichment of particulate trace metals in the southern East China Sea,Hung J;Chan C,"This study investigates the distribution and enrichment of trace metals in suspended and sinking particulate matter from southern East China Sea (ECS) north of Taiwan during the period of April 1992 to April 1993. According to these results, concentrations of suspended particulate matter (SPM) in the inner shelf of southern ECS, the upwelling-influenced shelf break, and Kuroshio water are 1.2 (surface)-4.2 (bottom) mg/l, ca. 0.3-0.5 mg/l, and 0.1-0.3 mg/l, respectively, reflecting various influences of terrestrial inputs. A benthic nepheloid layer (BNL), apparently owing to resuspension of local and/or remote bottom sediments, formed over the shelf region. Temporal Variation in trace metal contents and enrichment in suspended matter from the shelf region reflect the variability of metal inputs from Chinese rivers, particularly from Changjiang runoff. The abundance of a particulate metal is largely determined by the SPM content. Hence, the abundant profiles of most particulate metals closely correspond to the distribution pattern of SPM. However, concentrations of most particulate metals (except for Al and Fe), based on the dry weight of SPM, increase from the China coastal water to the Kuroshio water. The enriched metals are more likely to have derived from terrestrial inputs, rather than solely from biological accumulation. In addition, a decrease in metal contents and an increase in salinity confirm the transport of suspended particulate metals from the ECS shelf to the open ocean. Such an occurrence is verified by the feature of metal plume in the intermediate layer (550-800 m) of Kuroshio water. Moreover, the sinking particles collected from sediment traps deployed on the upper slope are relatively enriched in lithogenic matter and trace metals. Terrestrial inputs apparently control the distribution of most trace metals in suspended and sinking particulates in the southern ECS.","Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Inst Marine Geol & Chem, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,,"Hung, JJ (corresponding author), Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Inst Marine Geol & Chem, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan.",,,,10.2343/geochemj.32.189,Article,CONTINENTAL-SHELF; CHANGJIANG ESTUARY; SUSPENDED MATTER; YANGTZE-RIVER; TRANSPORT; SEDIMENT; DEPOSITION; VERTEX,GEOCHEMICAL SOC JAPAN,GEOCHEMICAL JOURNAL,10,32,ISI,NATL SUN YAT SEN UNIV,NATL SUN YAT SEN UNIV,A
2005.0,Geochem. J.,Gas compositions and helium isotopic ratios of fluid samples around Kueishantao NE offshore Taiwan and its tectonic implications,Yang T;Lan T;Lee H;Fu C;Chuang P;Lo C;Chen C;Chen C;Lee C,"Kueishantao is a Holocene volcanic islet (<7,000 yrs) located at NE offshore Taiwan, and tectonically is part of western extension of the Okinawa Trough. Magmatic activities are considered very active around this area on the basis of the fact that on-land fumaroles and submarine hydrothermal systems are prevailing currently. Representative bubble gas samples from submarine hydrothermal vents were collected for gas composition and helium isotope analysis. The gases show similar compositions of low temperatre furnaroles in the world, i.e., with high CO2 and H2S but low SO2 and HCl contents. They exhibit consistent high He-3/He-4 ratios (7.3-8.4 R-A where R-A is the He-3/He-4 ratio of air), probably the highest He-3/He-4 values of gases ever reported in active hydrothermal areas of the western Pacific region. Meanwhile, seawater samples around Kueishantao and other fluid samples from I-Lan Plain, the land area closest to the Kueishantao and also the southernmost part of the Okinawa Trough, show a significant excess of He-3 compositions as well. This indicates that the mantle component plays an important role for their gas sources, and implies that the mantle fluids may have invaded into I-Lan Plain. The westward opening of the Okinawa Trough may have caused thinning of the continental crust and produced deep normal faults and hence, the primordial He-3 is able to degas from mantle source region without significant crust contamination.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei 106, Taiwan.; Natl Appl Res Labs, Taipei 106, Taiwan.; Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Inst Marine Geol & Chem, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.; Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Inst Appl Geophys, Chilung 202, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,9,1.0,1.0,"Yang, TF (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, POB 13-318, Taipei 106, Taiwan.",,,He-3/He-4 ratios; Okinawa Trough; Kueishantao; hot springs; Taiwan,10.2343/geochemj.39.469,Article; Proceedings Paper,BACK-ARC BASIN; IAVCEI FIELD WORKSHOPS; LESSER ANTILLES ISLAND; OKINAWA TROUGH; NORTHERN TAIWAN; POSTCOLLISIONAL MAGMATISM; CONTINENT COLLISION; SUBDUCTION-ZONE; HE-3/HE-4 RATIO; VOLCANIC GASES,GEOCHEMICAL SOC JAPAN,GEOCHEMICAL JOURNAL,69,39,ISI,NATL TAIWAN UNIV;NATL APPL RES LABS;NATL SUN YAT SEN UNIV;NATL TAIWAN OCEAN UNIV,NATL TAIWAN UNIV,B2
2005.0,Geochem. J.,Reconnaissance of soil gas composition over the buried fault and fracture zone in southern Taiwan,Fu C;Yang T;Walia V;Chen C,"The soil-gas method is based on the principle that faults and/or fractures are highly permeable pathways in rock formation where gases can migrate upward from the deep crust and/or mantle and retain their deep-source signatures in the soil cover. This method is adopted because it can give results in short time and at low costs. In this work, soil-gas compositions are measured and synthesized in conjunction with the geological, geophysical and geomorphological information along the Chaochou Fault, which is considered as an active fault in southern Taiwan. More than 500 soil-gas samples were collected along 18 traverses crossing the observed structures and analyzed for He, CO2, CH4, O-2 + Ar and N-2. The results show that both helium and carbon dioxide concentrations in the soil gas have anomalous values at the specific positions in each of the traverses. The trace of these positions coincides with the N-S trending faults and/or fractures, that is, the postulated trend and pattern of the faults in southern Taiwan. Hence, helium and carbon dioxide are useful index gases in this area. Based on the helium and carbon dioxide concentrations of the soil gases, at least three components are required to explain the observed variations. In addition to the atmospheric air component, two gas sources can be recognized. One is the deep crust component, exhibiting high He and CO2 concentrations, and considered as best indicator for the surface location of fault/fracture zones in the region. The other component could be a shallower gas source with high CO2 Concentration, and low He concentration. Moreover, helium isotopic compositions of representative samples vary from 0.52 to 1.05 Ra (the He-3/He-4 ratio of air), illustrating that most samples have soil air component and may be mixed with some crustal component but no significant input of mantle component. Carbon isotopic composition (delta C-13) of carbon dioxide in the soil samples vary from -11.8 to -23.4 parts per thousand, which could be the result of mixing of organic and limestone components. Both helium and carbon isotopic results support the multiple gas sources in studied area. Meanwhile, continuous monitoring indicates that soil gas variations at fault zone may be closely related to the local crustal stress and hence, is suitable for further monitoring on fault activities.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei 106, Taiwan.; Natl Ctr Res Earthquake Engn, Taipei 106, Taiwan.; Natl Appl Res Labs, Taipei 106, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,4,1.0,1.0,"Yang, TF (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, POB 13-318, Taipei 106, Taiwan.",,,soil gas; active fault; Chaochou Fault; helium; carbon dioxide; Taiwan,10.2343/geochemj.39.427,Article; Proceedings Paper,EARTHQUAKE PREDICTION; CARBON-DIOXIDE; HELIUM CONCENTRATIONS; RADON; GROUNDWATER; CARRIER; GEOCHEMISTRY; EXHALATION; PRECURSOR,GEOCHEMICAL SOC JAPAN,GEOCHEMICAL JOURNAL,83,39,ISI,NATL TAIWAN UNIV;NATL CTR RES EARTHQUAKE ENGN;NATL APPL RES LABS,NATL TAIWAN UNIV,B2

The fluids had higher concentrations of chloride and sulfate and higher delta D-H2O and delta O-18(H2O) values than the local meteoric water. We concluded that the higher (delta D-H2O) and delta O-18(H2O) values were the result of either entry of surface meteoric water at low altitude via fault zones, or isotopic fractionation by depletion at 50 degrees C in a shallower fault zone, and at 125 degrees C in the deeper fault zone. The high temperature in the deeper fault zone might have been earthquake-related frictional heating, which led to isotopic fractionation. However, neither of the above hypotheses explains the high concentrations of Cl- and SO42-. We concluded that the high concentrations of Cl- and SO42- might have resulted from mixing with seawater and dissolution of pyrite, respectively.","Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Earth & Space Sci, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan.; Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Kochi Inst Core Sample Res, Nankoku, Kochi 7838502, Japan.; Hokkaido Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Nat Hist Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan.; Univ Ryukyus, Fac Sci, Dept Chem Biol & Marine Sci, Okinawa 9030213, Japan.; Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei 10764, Taiwan.; Natl Cent Univ, Inst Geophys, Jhongli, Taiwan.;",JAPAN;JAPAN;JAPAN;JAPAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,JAPAN,JAPAN,10,5.0,2.0,"Hirono, T (corresponding author), Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Earth & Space Sci, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan.",,,Chelungpu fault; Chi-Chi earthquake; pore fluid cheinistry; isotopic fractionation; frictional heating,10.2343/geochemj.41.97,Article,WATER; QUANTITIES; O-18,GEOCHEMICAL SOC JAPAN,GEOCHEMICAL JOURNAL,4,41,ISI,OSAKA UNIV;KOCHI INST CORE SAMPLE RES;HOKKAIDO UNIV;UNIV RYUKYUS;NATL TAIWAN UNIV;NATL CENT UNIV,OSAKA UNIV,B2

2007.0,Geochem. J.,Mineralogy and chemistry of cored sediments from active margin off southwestern Taiwan,Chen J;Lo C;Lee Y;Huang S;Chou P;Yu H;Yang T;Wang Y;Chung S,"The cored sediments sampled by R/V Marion Dufrense are mostly muds consisting mainly of quartz, feldspar, illite, chlorite + kaolinite and calcite. Authigenic carbonates mainly composed of aragonite, calcite, dolomite and associated with Fe-montmorillonite and pyrite occur in core samples collected from station MD-052911 (22 degrees 15.6' N, 119 degrees 51.0' E) at 2137-2140 cm and 2237-2240 cm depth which may be formed via sulfate reduction by CH4. In general Illite/Quartz intensity ratios of the sediments show little variation with core depth indicating the relatively constant abundance of illite in the source rock on Taiwan. The cored sediments have higher average Al2O3, Sigma FeO and MgO but lower SiO2, Na2O, and CaO contents when compared with upper continental crust (UCC). High field strength elements (Zr, Hf, Y, Nb and Ta) are also depleted in the cored sediments. CaO, Sr, Mn and Pb in the core samples collected from station MD-052912 (22 degrees 21.5' N, 119 degrees 48.5' E) tend to decrease with depth which may be essentially related to the decrease of biogenic CaCO3 with core depth. The La/Th, La/Sc, Th/Sc ratios of the cored sediments are similar to those of UCC, however the (La/Yb)(N) ratios of the cored sediments are higher. The cored sediments display similar REE patterns with LREE enrichment and negative Eu anomaly reflecting a felsic nature of the source rock which can also be identified in the La-Th-Sc plot. The chemistry of the sediments can be deduced using a mixing model involved four end members i.e., shale, greywacke, quartzite and limestone.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, Taipei 10764, Taiwan.; Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Geosci, Taipei 10764, Taiwan.; Minist Econ Affairs, Cent Geol Survey, Taipei, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,9,1.0,,"Chen, JC (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, Taipei 10764, Taiwan.",,,cored sediments; mineralogy and chemistry; active margin; off SW Taiwan,10.2343/geochemj.41.303,Article,CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; FORELAND BASIN; EVOLUTION; SHALES; USA; GEOCHEMISTRY; SILTSTONES; SANDSTONES; COLORADO; ELEMENT,GEOCHEMICAL SOC JAPAN,GEOCHEMICAL JOURNAL,13,41,ISI,NATL TAIWAN UNIV;NATL TAIWAN UNIV,NATL TAIWAN UNIV,A
2007.0,Geochem. J.,Paleoenvironmental evolution as revealed by analysis of organic carbon and nitrogen A case of coastal Taipei Basin in Northern Taiwan,Ku H;Chen Y;Chan P;Liu H;Lin C,"In an attempt to discriminate different sources of organic matter and reconstruct the paleo-enviromnent of the Taipei Basin, northern Taiwan over the past 250,000 years, organic carbon and nitrogen content (C/N ratios) and isotope composition (delta C-13 and delta N-15) are measured for sediment samples collected from core Wu-ku drilled at the depocenter in western Taipei Basin. The high delta C-13 values (up to -17.0 parts per thousand) and high C/N ratio (up to 14.9 and 13.0, respectively) indicate that this area underwent a period of relative aridity during MIS 2 and mid MIS 6. Another two periods of high and variable delta N-15 values (up to 15.5 and 13.5 parts per thousand, respectively) in MIS I and MIS 7 represent different nutrient condition in the basin. In MIS 1, high delta N-15 variability along with increasing TOC may reflect an unstable trend of aquatic productivity related to the dynamic mixing ratios of seawater and fresh water. The high delta N-15 values observed in the sediments of MIS 7 could be explained by the employment of a N-15-enriched nitrate from denitrification as the main source of nitrogen for primary producers.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei 10764, Taiwan.; Purdue Univ, Sch Civil Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA.; Cent Geol Survey, Taipei, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;USA;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,5,1.0,1.0,"Chen, YG (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, 1 Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 10764, Taiwan.",,,organic matter; delta C-13; delta N-15; C/N ratios; Taipei Basin,10.2343/geochemj.41.111,Article,ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION; LAKE-SEDIMENTS; STABLE-ISOTOPE; C/N RATIOS; DEEP-WATER; BALTIC SEA; MATTER; MARINE; PACIFIC; OCEAN,GEOCHEMICAL SOC JAPAN,GEOCHEMICAL JOURNAL,17,41,ISI,NATL TAIWAN UNIV;PURDUE UNIV,NATL TAIWAN UNIV,B2
2008.0,Geochem. J.,Elemental and SrNdPb isotopic compositions of late Cenozoic Abaga basalts Inner Mongolia Implications for petrogenesis and mantle process,Ho K;Liu Y;Chen J;Yang H,"The Abaga volcanic field is one of the largest and least known areas of late Cenozoic intraplate igneous activities in eastern China. Twenty-seven Abaga basaltic rocks were analyzed for major and trace element contents, Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic compositions, and K-Ar dating. These basalts predominantly consist of alkali basalt with subordinate transitional olivine tholeiite and rare quartz tholeiite. Combining our data of ten K-Ar dates with previously published data showed that the time of the principal volcanic eruption was from the Miocene to the Quaternary (14.57 similar to 0.19 Ma). A large amount of volcanic activity is believed to have begun in the northwestern portion of the AVF and gradually migrated southeastwards with geological time. The Abaga basalts exhibit chondrite-normalized REE patterns, incompatible elements and isotopic ratios (Sr-87/Sr-86 of 0.703654 similar to 0.704286 and Nd-143/Nd-144 of 0.512845 similar to 0.512891) affiliated with oceanic island basalts (OIBs). In general, they have relatively homogenous Pb isotopic compositions (Pb-206/Pb-204 of 18.409 similar to 18.521, Pb-207/Pb-204 of 15.514 similar to 15.546, and Pb-208/Pb-204 of 38.259 similar to 38.447), indicating that these lava suites have a similar source. But the alkali basalts are relatively enriched in incompatible elements when compared to the tholeiites. This compositional difference may be attributable to the different degrees of partial melting in the mantle source. The Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic data indicated that the mantle sources of the late Cenozoic Abaga basalts display a DMM-EM2 array similar to those of Southeast Asia. The Pb-208/Pb-204 vs. Pb-206/(204) Pb plot was also significantly displaced above the Northern Hemisphere reference line in a pattern clustering near the less-depleted end of the field for the Indian Ocean mid-oceanic ridge basalt (MORB) that shows Dupal signatures. Therefore, we suggest that the Abaga basaltic magmas were dominantly derived from an Indian Ocean MORB-like depleted asthenospheric source with fewer contributions of an enriched mantle component (EM2) from the subcontinental lithospheric mantle.","Natl Museum Nat Sci, Dept Geol, Taichung 404, Taiwan.;  Chinese Acad Geol Sci, Inst Geol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, Taipei 106, Taiwan.;  Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;CHINA;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,4,1.0,,"Ho, KS (corresponding author), Natl Museum Nat Sci, Dept Geol, Taichung 404, Taiwan.","National Science Council, Taiwan, ROCMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [NSC94-2116-M-178-001]; National Museum of Natural Science, Taiwan","We thank F.

2009.0,Geochem. J.,Nitrogen and Nisotope variation during lowgrade metamorphism of the Taiwan mountain belt,Yui T;Kao S;Wu T,"To investigate factors affecting the evolution of nitrogen system in rocks during progressive metamorphism. unmetamorphosed to greenschist-facies pelitic samples were collected from both pelitic and (pelitic members of) psammitic rock sequences along two transects of the Taiwan mountain belt. Among all samples, greenschist-facies metapelites front the Tananao metamorphic basement of this mountain belt exhibit the most variable and depleted nitrogen content and delta N-15 Values. The observations are difficult to interpret and call only be accounted for by complicated tectonic/metamorphic history of the basement complex. On the other hand. irrespective of the different metamorphic grades, samples from the metamorphosed cover strata, which have been subjected to only one stage of metamorphism, show comparable nitrogen and N-isotope composition. The only exception is that greenschist-facies metapelites from the pelitic members of psammitic rock sequence (i.e.. the G(Ps) group samples) of the cover strata are enriched in the N-15 isotope by at least 1 parts per thousand. Taking Al content as a normalizing factor, averaged N/Al and LOI/Al show systematic decrease through progressive metamorphism. Given the non-homogeneous nature of the sedimentary protoliths. the comparable N-isotope composition among the unmetamorphosed to zeolite-facies (i.e.. S-Z) group, prehnite-pumpellyite-facies (i.e., PP) group and greenschist-facies (i.e.. G) group samples from pelitic rock sequences call be explained by rock devolatilization with limited nitrogen depletion (<10%). High delta N-15 composition of the G(Ps) group samples might be mainly due to more extensive nitrogen depletion (similar to 25%). It is suggested that during metamorphism. the pelitic rock sequence may approximate a closed system, while thick psammitic rock Sequence may behave more like an open system, facilitating nitrogen depletion and N-isotope fractionation even for thin pelitic members within a thick psamimtic sequence. Lithology, in addition to other factors, therefore plays a role in controlling the evolution of the nitrogen system during low-grade metamorphism. The present study implies that element transport by dehydration fluid in subduction Zones may largely take place along fluid channel ways.","Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei 115, Taiwan.;  Acad Sinica, Res Ctr Environm Changes, Taipei 115, Taiwan.;  Univ Western Ontario, Dept Geol, London, ON, Canada.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;CANADA,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,1.0,"Yui, TF (corresponding author), Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei 115, Taiwan.","National Science Council of ROCMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan",Helpful comments/suggestions by R.

J.,Soil radon flux and concentrations in hydrothermal area of the Tatun Volcano Group Northern Taiwan,Yang T;Wen H;Fu C;Lee H;Lan T;Chen A;Hong W;Lin S;Walia V,"Rn-222 (radon) is the major radioactive gas in volcanic area. The study of radon concentration variations in volcanic areas has been considered as a useful tool to investigate the volcanic activity in one area. Tatun Volcano Group, where close to Taipei basin and exhibits active fumaroles and hot springs, was chosen for first time systematical study of radon gas in Hsiao-You-Keng hydrothermal area of northern Taiwan. In addition to soil CO2 flux and gas compositions, radon concentrations in soil were measured in situ by an analogous radon sensor. The sensor is developed to separate the electronics from the measurement chamber, which contains the detector and the preamplifier completely covered by epoxy, and can be used in the aggressive environment. Combined with gas composition and helium isotopic data, we can conclude that the radon gas is mainly carried by the volcanic gases. Therefore, it is considered as a good proxy for monitoring the magma activity in this area. A monitoring station was newly setup for such purpose and the preliminary monitoring data will be presented in this study.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.;  NARL, Natl Ctr Res Earthquake Engn, Taipei 106, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,9,1.0,1.0,"Yang, TF (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, 1,Sec 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.",,,soil radon; hydrothermal area; Tatun Volcano Group; volcanic gas; Taiwan,,Article; Proceedings Paper,SW TAIWAN; GAS GEOCHEMISTRY; SOUTHERN TAIWAN; TIME-SERIES; FAULT ZONE; EARTHQUAKE; HELIUM; RN-222; ISLAND; ARC,GEOCHEMICAL SOC JAPAN,GEOCHEMICAL JOURNAL,27,45,ISI,NATL TAIWAN UNIV;NATL CTR RES EARTHQUAKE ENGN,NATL TAIWAN UNIV,B2
2011.0,Geochem. J.,The origin and detection of spikelike anomalies in soil gas radon time series,Chyi L;Quick T;Yang T;Chen C,"Desorption of radon is of short duration but longer than telluric noises and is usually accomplished in less than one minute based on our binary event counting with a 16 second interval. Adapting an hourly counting time schedule, telluric noises as well as transient variation of radon anomalies of a few hours duration can be excluded but not the spike-like anomalies of a few minutes duration. The time series of soil gas radon, as recorded continuously in a redesigned ditch located inside an active fault zone, has sporadic spike-like anomalies. The anomalies could represent desorbed radon from shallow sources as observed from a similar detecting system located near a construction site. Radon release due to compressive stress is related to compressive back-filling activities. Spike-like anomalies, on the other hand, are related to caisson auguring shear activities. Charge transfer related to electrokinetic potential phenomena may have resulted in the sudden radon releases and caused spike-like anomalies. The timing of the anomalies provides good information on the timing of electokinetic potential change as a result of outward propagation of stress from hypocenter. With multiple monitoring stations, the location, timing, and magnitude of the incoming earthquake can then be calculated or graphically derived.","Univ Akron, Dept Geol & Environm Sci, Akron, OH 44325 USA.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei 106, Taiwan.;",USA;TAIWAN,USA,USA,4,2.0,,"Chyi, LL (corresponding author), Univ Akron, Dept Geol & Environm Sci, Akron, OH 44325 USA.",,,radon detection; spike-like anomaly; time series; soil gas; earthquake cycle,,Article; Proceedings Paper,SW TAIWAN; EARTHQUAKES; FAULT,GEOCHEMICAL SOC JAPAN,GEOCHEMICAL JOURNAL,10,45,ISI,UNIV AKRON;NATL TAIWAN UNIV,UNIV AKRON,X
2016.0,Geochem. J.,The chemical and isotopic compositions of gas discharge from shallowwater hydrothermal vents at Kueishantao offshore northeast Taiwan,Chen X;Zhang H;Li X;Chen C;Yang T;Ye Y,"The chemical and isotopic compositions of gases discharging from shallow-water hydrothermal vents at Kueishantao (KST, northeast Taiwan) have been studied since 2000. In this paper, we present new data gathered from 2010 to 2014. The main component is CO2 (162-882 mmol/mol), followed by N-2 (33-634 mmol/mol), CH4 (18-190 mmol/mol), and H2S (b.d.l.-172 mmol/mol). Helium isotope values indicate that more than 70% of the helium is mantle-derived. O-2 was mostly a contaminant from ambient seawater during sampling, or from air after sampling. By subtracting the contaminant fractions of N-2 and Ar, using the O-2 concentrations plus the N-2/O-2 or Ar/O-2 ratios in air, the residual N2 and Ar were positively correlated to a significant extent, and exhibited N-2/Ar ratios close to air values. These corrected fractions of N-2 and Ar were derived from seawater percolated during the discharge stage. The delta C-13 values of CO2 ranged from -8.2 to -5.5% (VPDB), whereas the CO2 contents were largely controlled by its dissolution in the fluid phase. The estimated endmember contributions for CO2 were: mantle (8-32%), sediment (14-27%), and marine limestone (54-72%). CH4 was the main hydrocarbon in the KST gases, and exhibited a linear relationships with helium. The CH4/He-3 ratios increased dramatically from 0.1-20 x 10(6) during 2000 and 2003 to 3-5 x 10(8) after 2010, either due to the increasing CH4 contents or the decreasing input of magmatic helium. In the C-1/C2+ ratios versus delta C-13(CH4) (-26.8 to -24.5 parts per thousand) diagram, the KST gas samples lie at the boundary between thermogenic and abiotic, suggesting that CH4 may be derived from these two sources. Alternatively, according to the log(C-2/C-3) versus log(C-1/C-2) diagram and the C-1-C-5 distribution patterns, the C2+ hydrocarbons and less than 2% of the CH4 may have originated from either a kinetically-controlled Fischer Tropsch-Type (FTT) reaction or a thermogenic process, whereas more than 98% of CH4 was in equilibrium with CO2. In addition, the linear-logC(2)-C-5 patterns suggest that no significant secondary processes have occurred. This is the first study of KST gases to include carbon stable isotope ratio measurements, which provides important information about gases released from a shallow-water submarine hydrothermal field at a subduction zone.","Zhejiang Univ, Ocean Coll, Zhoushan 316021, Peoples R China.;  Chinese Acad Sci, Sanya Inst Deep Sea Sci & Engn, Lab Expt Study Deep Sea Extreme Condit, Sanya 572000, Peoples R China.;  State Ocean Adm, Key Lab Submarine Geosci, Hangzhou 310012, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.;  Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Oceanog, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei 106, Taiwan.;",CHINA;CHINA;CHINA;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,CHINA,CHINA,6,4.0,1.0,"Chen, XG (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Ocean Coll, Zhoushan 316021, Peoples R China.","Aim for the Top University Program of Taiwan [03C0302]; China Ocean Mineral R&D Association (COMRA) project [DY125-12-R-02, DY125-12-R-04, DY125-12-R-06]; Sino-German Joint project on marine and polar fields ""The Kueishantao hydrothermal vents as a natural laboratory for ocean acidification""; Chinese Government Scholarship [201406325045]","The authors thank Prof. Li-Lian Liu (National Sun Yat-Sen University) and Seawatch Co. for the sampling.

1988.0,Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta,10Be study of rapid erosion in Taiwan,Chen-Feng Y;Typhoon L;Brown L;Jason J S J;Ju-Chin C,"Cosmogenic 10Be was measured using accelerator mass spectrometry in soils and sediments to study the erosion of Taiwan, which has the highest denudation rate in the world. The river sediments in Taiwan have very low 10Be concentrations, around 5 million atoms per gram, about 1 45 the world wide average. This is the direct consequence of its high sediment yield of more than 1000 mg/cm2/yr, 70 times the world average. Combining these values we found that, for Taiwan as a whole, the 10Be output to the sea only slightly exceeds the input from the rain, a situation typical of many areas around the world. Therefore, even in this example of extremely rapid erosion, 10Be seems to remain a useful indicator for erosion status. The total 10Be inventory found in a soil profile from a geologically stable area is at least 18% of the maximum possible inventory. The minimum age thus estimated for the soil is 0.11 Ma, in reasonable agreement with estimates from other means. The maximum erosion rate for this area thus estimated is at most 0.14 mg/cm2/yr, four orders of magnitude slower than the average value observed for Taiwan. We also demonstrate that the shelf sediments around Taiwan have received the admixing of a 10Be rich component from the ocean and would give a poor estimate for material eroded from Taiwan. © 1988.","Institute of Earth Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan; Institute of Oceanography, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Terrestrial Magnetism, Carnegie Institution of Washington, Washington, DC, United States",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;USA,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,5,1.0,1.0,"Chen-Feng, Y.; Institute of Earth Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan",,NA NA,,10.1016/0016-7037(88)90037-3,Article,cosmogenic beryllium-10;  denudation rate;  rapid erosion;  sediment yield; Taiwan,,Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta,54,52,scopus,INSTITUTE OF EARTH SCIENCES;NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY;CARNEGIE INSTITUTION OF WASHINGTON,INSTITUTE OF EARTH SCIENCES,B2

1990.0,Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta,NdSrO isotopic evidence for source contamination and an unusual mantle component under Luzon Arc,Chang-Hwa C;Yuch-Ning S;Typhoon L;Cheng-Hong C;Mertzman S,"The Nd, Sr, and O isotopic compositions of 27 volcanic rocks from the northern Luzon Arc were determined. Their εlunateNd and 87Sr86Sr displayed large correlated variations (-6.1 to +9.5, 0.70335 to 0.70622). Except for three abnormal samples, the δ 18O (6.0 to 8.5%.) show an excellent correlation (r = 0.9) with the volatile contents. After correcting for the alteration effect using the correlation with volatile contents, the δ 18O range from 5.2 to 6.4%. and are close to values shown by primary mantle-derived igneous rocks. The extreme deviation of the Sr and Nd isotopic ratios away from those of the depleted mantle coupled with a mantle oxygen isotopic ratio demonstrates unequivocally that the magma of Luzon Arc was contaminated not in the crust but in its source zone by an enriched mantle component. This enriched mantle component cannot be entirely ascribed to subducted sediment if these sediments have compositions similar to that of the nearby continental crust in Taiwan or to the Pleistocene sediment being subducted presently at the Manila Trench. Additional contribution from an enriched mantle component with isotopic composition similar to that of the EMI component proposed by Zindler and Hart (1986) is required. Published Pb isotopic results (Sun, 1980) are consistent with the involvement of EMI. Such an EMI component has never been found before in an island arc setting. Ultramafic xenolith results (Richard, 1986a,b) suggest that this enriched mantle was formed in the mantle wedge via metasomatism by fluids possibly derived from the downgoing slab. However, the involvement of the lithosphere of the approaching Eurasia continent cannot be excluded. © 1990.","Institute of Earth Sciences, Academia Sinica, Box 23-59, Taipei, Taiwan; Institute of Geology, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907, United States; Department of Physics, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Geology, Franklin and Marshall College, Lancaster, PA 17604, United States",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;USA;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;USA,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,5,1.0,1.0,"Chang-Hwa, C.; Institute of Earth Sciences, Academia Sinica, Box 23-59, Taipei, Taiwan",,NA NA,,10.1016/0016-7037(90)90234-C,Article,isotopic analysis;  magmatic evolution;  mantle;  neodymium;  oxygen;  strontium;  volcanic rock; Pacific; Luzon Arc,,Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta,65,54,scopus,INSTITUTE OF EARTH SCIENCES;NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY;PURDUE UNIVERSITY;NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY;FRANKLIN AND MARSHALL COLLEGE,INSTITUTE OF EARTH SCIENCES,B2
1995.0,Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta,MIOCENE BASALTS IN NORTHWESTERN TAIWAN EVIDENCE FOR EMTYPE MANTLE SOURCES IN THE CONTINENTAL LITHOSPHERE,CHUNG S;JAHN B;CHEN S;LEE T;CHEN C,"Cenozoic extension around the Taiwan Strait resulted in intraplate basalt volcanism in the Fujian-Taiwan region of the southeastern China continental margin. in northwestern Taiwan, the basalt volcanism took place in two distinct periods: the early Miocene (23-20 Ma), with the eruption of alkali basalt only, and the late Miocene (13-9 Ma), marked by the emplacement of various basalt types. The early Miocene basalts have uniform Sr-Nd-Pb isotope compositions comparable with those of the other Fujian-Taiwan basalts, which are believed to have originated from a ''plum-pudding'' type convecting mantle. These basalts display EM2-type lead isotope signature like that observed in seamount basalts from the South China Sea. By contrast, the late Miocene basalts show distinctive isotope characteristics indicating additional involvement of an EM1-type mantle source that has never been identified before for any volcanics in southern China. We propose that the ''enriched mantle'' components (EM1 and EM2) reside in different levels of the continental lithospheric mantle. Reactivation of the unique EM1 source may be ascribed to the are-continent collision in Taiwan during the last 12 million years which terminated the intraplate volcanism around this region.","UNIV RENNES 1,F-35042 RENNES,FRANCE.; ACAD SINICA,INST EARTH SCI,TAIPEI,TAIWAN.; NATL TAIWAN UNIV,DEPT PHYS,TAIPEI,TAIWAN.;",FRANCE;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,FRANCE,TAIWAN,5,2.0,1.0,"CHUNG, SL (corresponding author), NATL TAIWAN UNIV,DEPT GEOL,245 CHOUSHAN RD,TAIPEI,TAIWAN.",,,,10.1016/0016-7037(94)00360-X,Article,TRACE-ELEMENT EVIDENCE; SOUTH CHINA BASIN; VOLCANIC-ROCKS; EASTERN CHINA; ISOTOPIC GEOCHEMISTRY; TECTONIC EVOLUTION; PB ISOTOPES; LUZON ARC; ND; SR,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA,93,59,ISI,INST EARTH SCI;NATL TAIWAN UNIV,NATL TAIWAN UNIV,B2
1996.0,Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta,The calibration of DSrCa versus sea surface temperature relationship for Porites corals,Shen C;Lee T;Chen C;Wang C;Dai C;Li L,"Taking advantage of the availability of a continuous sea surface temperature (SST) record at Kenting, southern Taiwan, we have carried out a calibration of D[Sr/Ca]-SST (D: distribution coefficient) relationships for Porites lobata and P. lutea. Between 22 degrees C similar to 28 degrees C, the best fitting linear relationships for the two species agree within their respective errors with a maximum deviation less than 0.3 degrees C. Our calibration overlaps with the only published calibration for Porites (deVilliers et al., 1994) but is somewhat less temperature sensitive. The maximum temperature differences for the two calibrations between 21 degrees C and 27 degrees C are +/- 1.2 degrees C. The D-SST relationship calculated using the data of Beck et al. (1992, 1994) and their unpublished seawater data lies between these two calibrations. Our calibration removes some discrepancies previously described in the studies of McCulloch et al. (1994a) on the Great Barrier Reef and of Min et al. (1995) on New Caledonia. We found little growth rate effect on the calibration for P. lutea between 18 mm/yr and 23 mm/yr. We have also monitored the seawater [Sr/Ca] for the entire 1993. The observed variation of 0.033 mmol/mol can cause a temperature artifact of 0.7 degrees C and is thus a dominant error in using this new paleo-thermometer. To carry out this experiment, we have developed a microsurgical technique that can be used to sample corals at better than 0.15 mm resolution. The analytical precision should ultimately allow SST reconstruction of better than 0.2 degrees C. Furthermore, the insensitivity of the calibration against growth rate variation and species differences suggests a promising future for this new thermometer, in contrast to the pessimism of deVilliers et al. (1995). However, inter-laboratory differences and the question of seawater [Sr/Ca] variation need to be addressed first. We recommend a single SST calibration for the Sr/Ca thermometer on coral Politest Sr/Ca-N = 10.286-0.0514 x SST (N: normalized to Hawaii seawater [Sr/Ca] = 8.510 mmol/mol) or D[Sr/Ca] = 1.2077 - 0.006011 x SST.","NATL TSING HUA UNIV,DEPT CHEM,HSINCHU,TAIWAN.; NATL TAIWAN UNIV,DEPT GEOL,TAIPEI 10764,TAIWAN.; NATL TAIWAN UNIV,INST OCEANOG,TAIPEI 10764,TAIWAN.; ACAD SINICA,INST STAT,TAIPEI 115,TAIWAN.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,6,1.0,,"Shen, CC (corresponding author), ACAD SINICA,INST EARTH SCI,POB 1-55,TAIPEI 115,TAIWAN.",,,,10.1016/0016-7037(96)00205-0,Article,STRONTIUM; SR/CA; THERMOMETRY; TRANSPORT; SKELETONS; COLLOIDS; REEF,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA,172,60,ISI,NATL TSING HUA UNIV;NATL TAIWAN UNIV;NATL TAIWAN UNIV;INST STAT,INST EARTH SCI,A
1996.0,Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta,Variability of treering delta C13 in Taiwan fir Growth effect and response to May October temperatures,Sheu D;Kou P;Chiu C;Chen M,"We have analyzed the delta(13)C of tree-ring cellulose in three radial directions from a 120-year old (1873-1992) Taiwan fir (Abies Kawakamii (Hayata) Ito) growing on the margin of a relatively open forest at an elevation of approximately 3,844 m in southern Taiwan. The overall delta(13)C trend increases from approximately -24.0 parts per thousand to -22.4 parts per thousand to 1950, then drops sharply and fluctuates around an averaged value of -23.2 parts per thousand to 1992. Moreover, values of delta(13)C in different radial directions reveal a greater variability before 1950 than those after 1950 with the maximal and averaged amplitudes of 1.62 parts per thousand vs. 1.30 parts per thousand and 0.70 +/- 0.36 parts per thousand vs. 0.55 +/- 0.31 parts per thousand, respectively. A plot of annual increase in ring-area further shows that the growth of Taiwan fir has essentially stabilized in 1950. This synchronous change in 1950 points to a possible growth control on the observed variability of delta(13)C before 1950. The variation in delta(13)C from 1950 to 1992, however, is found to correlate inversely to the mean May-October temperatures and a response coefficient of -0.46 parts per thousand degrees C-1 is derived. Additional analysis of delta(13)C across five consecutive rings reveals that delta(13)C can vary up to 1.5 parts per thousand and becomes heavier from the early to the late woods. Such seasonal variations further appear to be different among individual rings. In view of these results, we conclude that apart from the commonly observed increase in tree-ring delta(13)C of forest trees due to the canopy effect, a similar increasing trend can also be seen in the coniferous trees and may be attributed to an accompanying decrease in the stomatal conductance with tree age. We further propose that an adequate estimate of the response of tree-ring delta(13)C to climatic and/or environmental changes must be performed on trees during stable growth.",,,,TAIWAN,4,,,"Sheu, DD (corresponding author), NATL SUN YAT SEN UNIV,INST MARINE GEOL,KAOHSIUNG 80424,TAIWAN.",,,,10.1016/0016-7037(95)00401-7,Article,ATMOSPHERIC CARBON-DIOXIDE; C-13-C-12 RATIO; ISOTOPE RATIOS; CELLULOSE; C-13; RECORDS; KASHMIR; LEAVES; INDIA; WOOD,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA,23,60,ISI,,NATL SUN YAT SEN UNIV,A
2005.0,Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta,Ion activity products of iron sulfides in groundwaters Implications from the Choshui fandelta Western Taiwan,Chen W;Liu T,"Precipitation of iron sulfides is an important process in groundwater geochemistry because it reduces iron mobility in anaerobic aquifers. Iron sulfides occur in various allotropic forms Such as amorphous FeS and pyrite, and their solubility products differ up to 13 orders of magnitude. However, few data for ion activity products (IAP) of iron sulfides defined by the equation: H+ + FeS(S) Fe2+ + HS- in groundwater have been reported in the literature. We computed IAP values of iron Sulfides for 46 groundwater samples from the Choshui fan-delta of Taiwan and 65 samples from other areas of the world. The mean of -log(IAP) values obtained for the 46 samples is 3.07 +/- 0.34 (1 sigma), which is consistent with the solubility constant 3.00 +/- 0.12 (Davison et al., 1999) of amorphous FeS, implying that the anaerobic aquifers in the Choshui fan-delta are still undergoing active sulfate-reduction processes and keeping the groundwater saturated with amorphous FeS. We suggest that the -logKsp value 3.91 of amorphous FeS adopted in the databases for WATEQF and PHREEQC computer programs ought to be revised to 3.00. Otherwise, the saturation indices (SI) calculated by the two computer programs will be an order of magnitude too high.

2005.0,Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta,Natural speciation of Mn Ni and Zn at the micrometer scale in a clayey paddy soil using Xray fluorescence absorption and diffraction,Manceau A;Tommaseo C;Rihs S;Geoffroy N;Chateigner D;Schlegel M;Tisserand D;Marcus M;Tamura N;Chen Z,"The natural speciation of Mn (0.19 g/kg), Ni (46 mg/kg), and Zn (42 mg/kg) in the argillic horizon (120 cm depth, pH = 5.6) of an Ultisol from a paddy soil in northern Taiwan was investigated by advanced X-ray synchrotron techniques. Microchemical associations were imaged by synchrotron-based X-ray microfluorescence, host minerals were identified by standard and micrometer-resolved X-ray diffraction, and the local coordination environment of Mn, Ni, and Zn was probed using extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy on a powdered sample and a soil thin section, and polarized EXAFS spectroscopy on a highly textured self-supporting clay film from the < 2 mu m fraction of the soil. Manganese was concentrated in Fe-Mn soft mottles (44.4 g/kg) as turbostratic hexagonal birnessite and lithiophorite having Mn3+/Mn4+ atomic ratios of similar to 20% and 50%, respectively. Quantitative analysis of high-order scattering paths of the EXAFS spectrum for natural and synthetic (Al0.67Li0.32)(Mn0.684+Mn0.323+)O-2(OH)(2) lithiophorite revealed that Mn3+ and Mn4+ are ordered in the [(Mn0.684+Mn0.323+)O-2](0.32-) layer. A structural model is proposed, in which Mn4+ and Mn3+ are ordered similarly to Al and Li in the [(A(0.67)(3+)Li(0.32)(+))(OH2)O-2](0.32+) layer, with Mn3+ cations being surrounded by six Mn4+, and Mn4+ cations by three Mn3+ and three Mn. Similar cation ordering in the manganese and aluminum layers likely provides a more homogeneous local balance of the excess and deficit of charges in each layer and increases the stability of lithiophorite. Ni (r = 0.70 angstrom) substitutes for Mn (r(Mn4+) = 0.54 angstrom, r(Mn3+) = 0.65 angstrom) in the manganese layer in the natural lithiophorite. In contrast, Zn (r = 0.74 angstrom) fills vacant sites in the gibbsitic layer of natural lithiophorite, in a similar manner as lithium (r = 0.74 angstrom) in synthetic lithiophorite. The partitioning of Ni and Zn between the two layers is a result of the general preference of Ni, whose size is intermediate between those of Mn3+ and Li+, for slightly smaller sites. In contrast with nickel, which is detected only where there is lithiophorite, the Zn-lithiophorite association found in Fe-Mn mottles is not representative of the bulk soil. The combined use of X-ray diffraction, and powder and polarized EXAFS spectroscopy revealed that Zn is predominantly bound to hydroxy-Al interlayers sandwiched between 2:1 vermiculite layers in the fine soil matrix. The incorporation of Zn in the gibbsitic layer of both lithiophorite and vermiculite helps increase the stability of these minerals by providing positive charge to balance the negative charge from the 2:1 phyllosilicate layer and the [(Mn0.684+Mn0.323+)O-2](0.32-) layer of lithiophorite. This binding environment for zinc is probably the main mechanism by which zinc is sequestered in acidic to near-neutral aluminum-rich clayey soils.

This dataset allows us to further assess the accuracy and precision of coral 230Th dating method. By applying quality control, including careful sampling and subsampling protocols and the use of contamination-free storage and workbench spaces, the resulting low procedural blanks give an equivalent uncertainty in age of only ±0.2-0.3 yr for 1-2 g of coral sample. Using site-specific 230Th/232Th0 values or isochron techniques, our study demonstrates that corals with an age less than 100 yrs can be 230Th-dated with precisions of ±1 yr. Six living subtidal coral samples were collected from two continental shelf sites, Nanwan off southern Taiwan in the western Pacific and Son Tra off central Vietnam in the South China Sea; one coral core was drilled from an open-ocean site, Santo Island, Vanuatu, in the western tropical Pacific; and modern and fossil intertidal coral slabs, 17 in total, were cut from six sites around the islands of Simeulue, Lago, North Pagai and South Pagai of Sumatra in the eastern Indian Ocean. The results indicate that the main source of thorium is the dissolved phase of seawater, with variation of 230Th/232Th0 depending on local hydrology. With intense input of terrestrial material, low 230Th/232Th0 atomic ratios of 4.9 × 10-6 and 3.2 × 10-6 with a 10% variation are observed in Nanwan and Son Tra, respectively. At the Santo site, we find a value of 5.6 × 10-6 at 4 horizons and one high value of 24 × 10-6 in a sample from AD 1974.6 ± 0.5, likely due to the upwelling of cold water during a La Niña event between AD 1973 and 1976. The natural dynamics of 230Th/232Th0 recorded in the intertidal corals at sites in the Sumatran islands are complicated so that this value varies significantly from 3.0 to 9.4 × 10-6. Three of the 141 modern coral 230Th ages differ from their true ages by -23 to +4, indicating the presence of detrital material with anomalous 230Th/232Th values. Duplicate measurement of coeval subsamples is therefore recommended to verify the age accuracy.

2009.0,Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta,Sulfides in mantle peridotites from Penghu Islands Taiwan Melt percolation PGE fractionation and the lithospheric evolution of the South China block,Wang K;O'Reilly S;Griffin W;Pearson N;Zhang M,"Major elements, highly siderophile elements (HSE) and Re-Os isotope ratios were analysed in situ on individual sulfide grains in spinel peridotite xenoliths hosted by Miocene intraplate basalts from the Penghu Islands, Taiwan. The xenoliths represent texturally and compositionally different mantle domains, and the geochemical characteristics of the sulfides show changes in HSE distribution and Re-Os isotope systematics, produced as their host rocks were metasomatised by percolating fluids/melts. in prophyroclastic and partly metasomatised peridotites from the Kueipi (KP) locality, the sulfides have subchondritic to superchondritic Re-187/Os-188 and Os-187/Os-188 ratios. Many of these sulfides reflect fluid/melt interaction with residual MSS and/or crystallization of fractionated sulfide melts, which produced high contents of Cu and PPGEs and high Re/Os; inferred melt/rock ratios are low. In contrast, sulfides in equigranular and extensively metasomatised peridotites from the Tungchiyu (TCY) locality are mainly more sulfur-rich Ni-(Co)-rich MSS, with subchondritic to chondritic Os-187/Os-188 and subchondritic Re-187/Os-188. These sulfides are interpreted as products of interaction between pre-existing MSS and percolating silicate melts. Melt/rock ratios were high and the percolating melt was less differentiated than the melt that percolated the KP peridotites. Sulfides in a TCY pyroxenite are mainly MSS; they have the lowest HSE contents, subchondritic to superchondritic Os-187/Os-188 and subchondritic Re-187/Os-188, and may have precipitated from sulfide melts that segregated from basaltic melts under S-saturated conditions. In most sulfides melt percolation appears to have induced fractionation among the HSEs and disturbed Re-Os isotope compositions. Despite the metasomatic effects, rare residual MSS, sulfides that from crystallised sulfide melts and sulfides modified by addition of Re (with no evidence for Os addition) can still provide useful chronological information. Such sulfides yield T-RD age peaks of 1.9, 1.7-1.6, 1.4-1.3 and 0.9-0.8 Ga, which may record the timing of melt extraction and/or metasomatic events in the mantle. These periods are contemporaneous with the major crustal events recorded by U-Pb dates and Nd and Hf model ages in the overlying crust. This close correspondence indicates that the sulfide T-RD ages reflect the timing of lithosphere-scale tectonothermal events (such as melting and metasomatism) that affected both the lithospheric mantle and the overlying crust. The sulfide TRD ages, taken together with the crustal data, suggest that most of the Cathaysia block had formed at least by Paleo-Proterozoic time, and that some domains are Archean in age.

2010.0,Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta,The isotopic composition of particulate organic carbon in mountain rivers of Taiwan,Hilton R;Galy A;Hovius N;Horng M;Chen H,"Small rivers draining mountain islands are important in the transfer of terrestrial particulate organic carbon (POC) to the oceans. This input has implications for the geochemical stratigraphic record. We have investigated the stable isotopic composition of POC (delta C-13(org)) in rivers draining the mountains of Taiwan. In 15 rivers, the suspended load has a mean (delta C-13(org) that ranges from -28.1 +/- 0.8 parts per thousand to -22.0 +/- 0.2 parts per thousand (on average 37 samples per river) over the interval of our study. To investigate this variability we have supplemented suspended load data with measurements of POC in bedrock and river bed materials, and constraints on the composition of the terrestrial biomass. Fossil POC in bedrock has a range in delta C-13(org) from -25.4 +/- 1.5 parts per thousand to -19.7 +/- 2.3 parts per thousand between the major geological formations. Using coupled delta C-13(org) and N/C we have found evidence in the suspended load for mixing of fossil POC with non-fossil POC from the biosphere. In two rivers outside the Taiwan Central Range anthropogenic land use appears to influence delta C-13(org), resulting in more variable and lower values than elsewhere. In all other catchments, we have found that 5 parts per thousand variability in delta C-13(org) is not controlled by the variable composition of the biomass, but instead by heterogeneous fossil POC. In order to quantify the fraction of suspended load POC derived from non-fossil sources (F-nf) as well as the isotopic composition of fossil POC (delta C-13(fossil)) carried by rivers, we adapt an end-member mixing model. River suspended sediments and bed sediments indicate that mixing of fossil POC results in a negative trend between N/C and delta C-13(org) that is distinct from the addition of non-fossil POC, collapsing multiple fossil POC end-members onto a single mixing trend. As an independent test of the model, F-nf reproduces the fraction modern (F-mod) in our samples, determined from C-14 measurements, to within 0.09 at the 95% confidence level. Over the sampling period, the mean F-nf of suspended load POC was low (0.29 +/- 0.02, n = 459), in agreement with observations from other mountain rivers where physical erosion rates are high and fossil POC enters river channels. The mean delta C-13(fossil) in suspended POC varied between -25.2 +/- 0.5 parts per thousand and -20.2 +/- 0.6 parts per thousand catchment to catchment. This variability is primarily controlled by the distribution of the major geological formations. It also covers entirely the range of delta C-13(org) found in marine sediments which is commonly thought to derive from mixing between marine and terrigenous POC. If land-sourced POC is preserved in marine sediments, then changes in the bulk delta C-13(org) observed offshore Taiwan could instead be explained by changes in the onshore provenance of sediment. The range in delta C-13(org) of fossil organic matter in sedimentary rocks exposed at the surface is large and given the importance of these rocks as a source of clastic sediment to the oceans, care should be taken in accounting for fossil POC in marine deposits supplied by active mountain belts.

2011.0,Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta,The fluvial geochemistry contributions of silicate carbonate and salinealkaline components to chemical weathering flux and controlling parameters Narmada River Deccan Traps India,Gupta H;Chakrapani G;Selvaraj K;Kao S,"The Narmada River in India is the largest west-flowing river into the Arabian Sea, draining through the Deccan Traps, one of the largest flood basalt provinces in the world. The fluvial geochemical characteristics and chemical weathering rates (CWR) for the mainstream and its major tributaries were determined using a composite dataset, which includes four phases of seasonal field (spot) samples (during 2003 and 2004) and a decade-long (1990-2000) fortnight time series (multiannual) data. Here, we demonstrate the influence of minor lithologies (carbonates and saline alkaline soils) on basaltic signature, as reflected in sudden increases of Ca2+-Mg2+ and Na+ contents at many locations along the mainstream and in tributaries. Both spot and multiannual data corrected for non-geological contributions were used to calculate the CWR. The CWR for spot samples (CWRspot) vary between 25 and 63 ton km(-2) year(-1), showing a reasonable correspondence with the CWR estimated for multiannual data (CWRmulti) at most study locations. The weathering rates of silicate (Si/WR), carbonate (CarbWR) and evaporite (Sal-AlkWR) have contributed similar to 38-58, 28-45 and 8-23%, respectively to the CWRspot at different locations. The estimated SilWR (11-36 ton km(-2) year(-1)) for the Narmada basin indicates that the previous studies on the North Deccan Rivers (Narmada-Tapti-Godavari) overestimated the silicate weathering rates and associated CO2 consumption rates. The average annual CO2 drawdown via silicate weathering calculated for the Narmada basin is similar to 0.032 x 10(12) moles year(-1), suggesting that chemical weathering of the entire Deccan Trap basalts consumes approximately 2% (similar to 0.24 x 10(12) moles) of the annual global CO2 drawdown. The present study also evaluates the influence of meteorological parameters (runoff and temperature) and physical weathering rates (PWR) in controlling the CWR at annual scale across the basin. The CWR and the SilWR show significant correlation with runoff and PWR. On the basis of observed wide temporal variations in the CWR and their close association with runoff, temperature and physical erosion, we propose that the CWR in the Narmada basin strongly depend on meteorological variability. At most locations, the total denudation rates (TDR) are dominated by physical erosion, whereas chemical weathering constitutes only a small part (<10%). Thus, the CWR to PWR ratio for the Narmada basin can be compared with high relief small river watersheds of Taiwan and New Zealand (1-5%) and large Himalayan Rivers such as the Brahmaputra and the Ganges (8-9%).

2013.0,Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta,The origin and migration of mud volcano fluids in Taiwan Evidence from hydrogen oxygen and strontium isotopic compositions,Chao H;You C;Liu H;Chung C,"Mud volcanoes are important gateways for deep fluids to migrate upward and provide windows for studying fluid/sediment interaction at depth. Fluids emitted from 40 terrestrial mud volcanoes were collected in southern and eastern Taiwan to study their chemical compositions, including H, O and Sr isotopes (Sr-87/Sr-86 and delta Sr-88/86). Relative to seawater, the mud volcano fluids are depleted in Cl, Mg, SO42-, and delta D and are elevated in B, Ba, Li, and delta O-18, possibly due to waterrock interaction and clay dehydration (mainly smectite to illite transformation) in the source region. The distribution of Sr in mud volcano fluids shows patterns associated with their localities and geological settings. Most fluids have higher Sr-87/Sr-86 than seawater, indicating water-rock interaction at depth. The low Na, Sr-87/S-86, and high Ca fluids emitted from eastern Taiwan imply intense interaction with igneous basement. Most fluids have higher Sr/Cl and lower delta(88) Sr than seawater except mud volcanoes in the northern Chu-kou Fault, which emit low Sr/Cl and extremely high delta(88) Sr (up to 0.82&) fluids. We performed laboratory carbonate precipitation experiments that indicate that these high Sr isotope ratios are caused by coprecipitation of carbonates from high alkalinity fluids. Mud volcano fluids in Taiwan originate at depth and their chemical compositions are controlled by the host rock, degrees of water-rock interaction, and clay dehydration, but also are masked by retrograde progresses, such as carbonate precipitation during migration. Our results show that an approach combining water isotopes (delta D and delta O-18) and strontium isotopes (Sr-87/Sr-86 and delta(88/86) Sr) provides a robust tool for tracing fluid sources and migration pathways in accretionary prisms.

2015.0,Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta,Evidence for stable Sr isotope fractionation by silicate weathering in a small sedimentary watershed in southwestern Taiwan,Chao H;You C;Liu H;Chung C,"Radiogenic Sr isotopes (Sr-87/Sr-86) are robust for provenance identification in hydrology, affected mainly by the age of background lithologies and the degree of chemical weathering. However, there is limited knowledge concerning the fractionation mechanism of stable Sr isotopes (Sr-88/Sr-86) in rivers. In this study, river water was collected on a weekly to monthly basis throughout dry and wet seasons. Furthermore, to study the variations of radiogenic and stable Sr isotopes during intense weathering, a major flooding event (2000 mm precipitation in three days, Typhoon Morakot), water was captured within a small drainage catchment system (161 km(2)) along the Hou-ku River in southwestern Taiwan. For a better constraint on the end member compositions, bedload sediments, suspended particles, and several host rocks were sampled for a systematic investigation. The carbonate and silicate phases of these solids were chemically separated. Dissolved major elements indicate that the watersheds were predominated by silicate weathering. Stable Sr isotopes show no significant variation (delta Sr-88 = 0.24-0.31 parts per thousand) temporally and spatially with an average of 0.28 parts per thousand. Additionally, all solids showed lower delta Sr-88 values than the river water while the host rocks had higher delta Sr-88 values (delta Sr-88 = 0.20-0.26 parts per thousand) than the residual weathering products (delta Sr-88 = 0.080-22 parts per thousand), indicating preferential leaching of heavy Sr into the hydrosphere and leaving light Sr in the residual solids. Results of laboratory acid leaching experiments reveal that dissolution of high delta Sr-88 value minerals occurred at an early stage of weathering. The variation of weathering intensity does not alter stable Sr isotopes in silicate weathering dominated river water, which contains higher stable Sr isotopes than the associated sediments. The silicatic sedimentary rocks preferentially released higher stable Sr isotopes into the hydrosphere during chemical weathering, thus leaving lower stable Sr isotopes in the residual solids.

Here we report on the impact of a major flood on the Choshui River, central-western Taiwan, generated by typhoon Mindulle, July 2–6, 2004, five years after the nearby Mw 7.6 Chichi earthquake. Water samples taken at 3-h intervals at three stations along main stem, as well as from two downriver tributaries, allow us to delineate the temporal and spatial variability in concentrations and fluxes of suspended and dissolved constituents within the middle and lower portions of the river in response to this flood. High suspended-sediment concentrations, some as high as 200 g/l, reflected the rapid erosion of landslide scars and debris deposits generated by super-typhoon Herb in 1996 and the 1999 Chichi earthquake. Dissolved-solid and suspended-sediment discharges totaled 0.22 and 70 million tons (mt), 50 mt of which were discharged in just two days. Particulate organic carbon (POC) discharge, most of which was pre-modern in age, was 195,000 t. More than half of the discharged water, POC and dissolved solids came from upriver, whereas about 70% of the suspended sediment and 60% of the dissolved nitrate came from two downriver tributaries, the Chenyoulan and Qingshui rivers.

2017.0,Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta,Typhoon impacts on chemical weathering source provenance of a High Standing Island watershed Taiwan,Meyer K;Carey A;You C,"Chemical weathering source provenance changes associated with Typhoon Mindulle (2004) were identified for the Choshui River Watershed in west-central Taiwan using radiogenic Sr isotope (Sr-87/Sr-86) and major ion chemistry analysis of water samples collected before, during, and following the storm event. Storm water sampling over 72 h was conducted in 3 h intervals, allowing for novel insight into weathering regime changes in response to intense rainfall events. Chemical weathering sources were determined to be bulk silicate and disseminated carbonate minerals at the surface and silicate contributions from deep thermal waters. Loss on ignition analysis of collected rock samples indicate disseminated carbonate can compose over 25% by weight of surface mineralogy, but typically makes up similar to 2-3% of watershed rock. 87 Sr/86 Sr and major element molar ratios indicate that Typhoon Mindulle caused a weathering regime switch from normal flow incorporating a deep thermal signature to that of a system dominated by surface weathering. The data suggest release of silicate solute rich soil pore waters during storm events, creating a greater relative contribution of silicate weathering to the solute load during periods of increased precipitation and runoff. Partial depletion of this soil solute reservoir and possible erosion enhanced carbonate weathering lead to increased importance of carbonates to the weathering regime as the storm continues. Major ion data indicate that complex mica weathering (muscovite, biotite, illite, chlorite) may represent an important silicate weathering pathway in the watershed. Deep thermal waters represent an important contribution to river solutes during normal non-storm flow conditions. Sulfuric acid sourced from pyrite weathering is likely a major weathering agent in the Choshui River watershed.

Acta,Carbon isotope exchange during anaerobic oxidation of methane AOM in sediments of the northeastern South China Sea,Chuang P;Yang T;Wallmann K;Matsumoto R;Hu C;Chen H;Lin S;Sun C;Li H;Wang Y;Dale A,"The major processes that determine the distribution of methane (CH4) in anoxic marine sediments are methanogenesis and the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM), with organoclastic sulfate reduction exerting an important secondary control. However, the factors leading to the distribution of stable carbon isotopes (delta C-13) of CH4 are currently poorly understood, in particular the commonly-observed minimum in delta C-13-CH4 at the sulfate-methane transition (SMT) where AOM rates reach maximum values. Conventional isotope systematics predict C-13-enrichment of CH4 in the SMT due to preferential (CH4)-C-12 consumption by AOM. Two hypotheses put forward to explain this discrepancy are the addition of C-12-enriched CH4 to pore-waters by methanogenesis in close proximity to AOM, and enzymatically-mediated carbon isotope equilibrium between forward and backward AOM at low concentrations of sulfate. To examine this in more detail, field data including delta C-13 of CH4 and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) from the continental margin offshore southwestern Taiwan were simulated with a reaction-transport model. Model simulations showed that the minima in delta C-13-CH4 and delta C-13-DIC in the SMT could only be simulated with carbon isotope equilibrium during AOM. The potential for carbon cycling between methanogenesis and AOM in and just below the SMT was insignificant due to very low rates of methanogenesis. Backward AOM also gives rise to a pronounced kink in the delta C-13-DIC profile several meters below the SMT that has been observed in previous studies. We suggest that this kink marks the true base of the SMT where forward and backward AOM are operating at very low rates, possibly sustained by cryptic sulfur cycling or barite dissolution.

2020.0,Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta,Chemical reactions porosity and microfracturing in shale during weathering The effect of erosion rate,Gu X;Rempe D;Dietrich W;West A;Lin T;Jin L;Brantley S,"The rate of chemical weathering has been observed to increase with the rate of physical erosion in published comparisons of many catchments, but themechanisms that couple these processes are not well understood. We investigated this question by examining the chemical weathering and porosity profiles from catchments developed on marine shale located in Pennsylvania, USA (Susquehanna Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory, SSHCZO); California, USA (Eel River Critical Zone Observatory, ERCZO); and Taiwan (Fushan Experimental Forest). The protolith compositions, protolith porosities, and the depths of regolith at these sites are roughly similar while the catchments are characterized by large differences in erosion rate (1-3 mm yr(-1) in Fushan >> 0.2-0.4 mm yr(-1) in ERCZO >> 0.01-0.025 mm yr(-1) in SSHCZO). The natural experiment did not totally isolate erosion as a variable: mean annual precipitation varied along the erosion gradient (4.2 m yr(-1) in Fushan > 1.9 m yr(-1) inERCZO > 1.1 m yr(-1) in SSHCZO), so the fastest eroding site experiences nearly twice the mean annual temperature of the other two. Even though erosion rates varied by about 100x, the depth of pyrite and carbonate depletion (defined here as regolith thickness) is roughly the same, consistent with chemical weathering of those minerals keeping up with erosion at the three sites. These minerals were always observed to be the deepest to react, and they reacted until 100% depletion. In two of three of the catchments where borehole observations were available for ridges, these minerals weathered across narrow reaction fronts. On the other hand, for the rock-forming clay mineral chlorite, the depth interval of weathering was wide and the extent of depletion observed at the land surface decreased with increasing erosion/precipitation. Thus, chemical weathering of the clay did not keep pace with erosion rate. But perhaps the biggest difference among the shales is that in the fast-eroding sites, microfractures account for 30-60% of the total porosity while in the slow-eroding shale, dissolution could be directly related to secondary porosity. We argue that the microfractures increase the influx of oxygen at depth and decrease the size of diffusion-limited internal domains of matrix, accelerating weathering of pyrite and carbonate under high erosion-rate conditions. Thus, microfracturing is a process that can couple physical erosion and chemical weathering in shales. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

2016.0,Geodin. Acta,A peculiar reworking of Ophiomorpha shafts in the Miocene Nangang Formation Taiwan,Lowemark L;Zheng Y;Das S;Yeh C;Chen T,"In the Miocene sandstones of the Nankang Formation in north-eastern Taiwan, different varieties of the trace fossil Ophiomorpha are abundant. In certain beds, a peculiar reworking of vertical Ophiomorpha shafts was observed. This reworking consists of an inner, lined tube positioned in the centre of the shaft. The shaft is lined by thin walls with small knobs and is distinctly different from the shafts of the Ophiomorpha nodosa mazes found in the same beds which have thick walls and large knobs. Because both outer and the inner tube walls were constructed by small sub-pellets, a diagenetic origin can be ruled out. The presence of sub-pellets further indicates that the inner tubes were also constructed by crustaceans and not commensal organisms such as worms or fish. The abundance of these vertical shafts suggests that they were constructed for a specific purpose, and the similarities in sub-pellets indicate that they likely were constructed by different generations of the same crustacean species. Because brooding chambers were not observed and are rare among extant marine crustaceans, we suggest that the vertical shafts were constructed to encourage juvenile shrimp to resettle in the parental burrows after they had completed their pelagic larval stages.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, POB 13-318, Taipei 106, Taiwan.;  Indian Inst Technol, Roorkee 247667, Uttarakhand, India.;",TAIWAN;INDIA,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,5,1.0,0.0,"Lowemark, L (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, POB 13-318, Taipei 106, Taiwan.",MOST (Ministry of Science and Technology) in Taiwan,The field work of this study was funded by MOST (Ministry of Science and Technology) in Taiwan.,Miocene; Ophiomorpha nodosa; shoreface; offshore; Taiwan,10.1080/09853111.2015.1035208,Article,BIFFARIUS-ARENOSUS DECAPODA; TRACE FOSSILS; THALASSINIDEAN SHRIMP; BURROW MORPHOLOGY; WESTERN KYUSHU; CALLIANASSIDAE; BEHAVIOR; IRREGULAIRE; CRUSTACEA; JAPAN,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,GEODINAMICA ACTA,11,28,ISI,NATL TAIWAN UNIV;INDIAN INST TECHNOL,NATL TAIWAN UNIV,B2
2002.0,Geofis. Int.,Automated radon monitoring of seismicity in a fault zone,Chyi L;Chou C;Yang F;Chen C,"Silicon photodiode detector and data logger are employed in soil gas radon measurement in Chuko fault zone in south central Taiwan. Time variation of radon shows that there is a radon earthquake preparation cycle with a fast radon build-up, then a sustaining high level, a spike-like anomaly, and then a faster decrease to near background level before the onset of an earthquake. The new integrated approach in soil gas radon monitoring reveals that the spike-like anomalies are superior precursors and could be used to delineate time and place of an earthquake. However, basement geology is a critical factor in determining time and place of earthquake. When multiple units of this system are emplaced at different locations, it is possible that the time, place, and magnitude of earthquakes could all be predicted.","Dept. of Geology, Univ. of Akron, Akron, OH 44325-4101, United States; Dept. of Geosciences, National Taiwan University, 245 Chosan Rd., Taipei 106, Taiwan",USA;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,USA,USA,4,2.0,0.0,"Chyi, L.L.; Dept. of Geology, , Akron, OH 44325-4101, United States; 電子郵件: lchyi@uakron.edu",,NA NA,Fault zone;  Radon;  Seismicity;  Taiwan,,Article,automation;  earthquake precursor;  monitoring system;  radon;  seismicity; Asia;  Eurasia;  Far East;  Taiwan,,Geofisica Internacional,18,41,scopus,UNIV.

Int.,Ionospheric response to Huge Gas Explosion in Kaohsiung City Taiwan on July 31 2014,Lin J,"In this paper the two-dimensional Principal Component Analysis (2DPCA) was used to determine the total electron content (TEC) anomaly using the principal eigenvalue of 2DPCA as a mathematical indicator in the ionospheric response to the huge gas explosion in Kaohsiung city (22 degrees 36'39 '' N 120 degrees 19'8 '' E), Taiwan at 15: 59 (UT) on July 31, 2014. 2DPCA has been shown to be sensitive to detect weak TEC anomalies. 2DPCA gives a careful data handling description. Results have shown that a TEC anomaly over Taiwan was observed from 16:00 to 16:05 (UT). The acoustic shock waves have caused a TEC anomaly detectable without considering the atmosphere situation and traveling of acoustic shock waves during this explosion. The duration time of the TEC anomaly was at least 5 minutes.","Southern Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Elect Engn, 1 Nan Tai St, Tainan, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,1,1.0,,"Lin, JW (corresponding author), Southern Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Elect Engn, 1 Nan Tai St, Tainan, Taiwan.",,,Two-dimensional principal component analysis (2DPCA); total electron content (TEC); huge gas explosion; Kaohsiung City; acoustic shock waves,,Article,ANOMALIES,INST GEOPHYSICS UNAM,GEOFISICA INTERNACIONAL,0,57,ISI,SOUTHERN TAIWAN UNIV SCI AND TECHNOL,SOUTHERN TAIWAN UNIV SCI AND TECHNOL,A
2004.0,Geofluids,Temporal change in groundwater level following the 1999 Mw 75 ChiChi earthquake Taiwan,Wang C;Wang C;Kuo C,"We examine the post-seismic change in the groundwater level following the 1999 (Mw = 7.5) Chi-Chi earthquake in central Taiwan, as recorded by a network of 70 evenly distributed hydrological stations over a large alluvial fan near the epicenter. Four types of post-seismic responses may be distinguished. In type 1, the groundwater level declined exponentially with time following a coseismic rise. This was the most common response in the study area and occurred in unconsolidated sediments on the Choshui River fan. In type 2, the groundwater level rose exponentially with time following a coseismic fall. This occurred in the deformed and fractured sedimentary rocks in the foothills near the Chelungpu fault that ruptured in the Chi-Chi earthquake. In type 3, the groundwater level continued to decline with time following a coseismic fall. This also occurred in the deformed and fractured sedimentary rocks near the ruptured fault. Finally, in type 4, the groundwater level, following a coseismic rise, stayed at the same level or even rose with time before it eventually declined. This occurred mostly in unconsolidated sediments along the coast of central Taiwan and along the Peikang Stream. We analyze these post-seismic responses by using a one-dimensional model. Together with the results from well test, the analysis show that the type 1 response may be explained by an aquifer model with coseismic recharge and post-seismic subhorizontal discharge across a length of 500-5000 m; the type 2 response may be explained by a model of coseismic discharge and post-seismic recharge from surface water; the type 3 response may be explained by a model of coseismic discharge and post-seismic subhorizontal discharge across a length of 500-5000 m; and the type 4 response may be explained by a model of coseismic recharge and sustained post-seismic recharge from surface water. The characteristic time for the post-seismic changes is similar to that for the ground-water-level decline during dry seasons before the earthquake, suggesting that there was no earthquake-induced changes in the aquifer properties (i.e. hydraulic conductivity), confirming the earlier results from recession analyses of the post-seismic streamflow elsewhere after several earthquakes. © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Department of Earth/Planetary Sci., University of California, Berkeley, CA, United States; Institute of Earth Sciences, Academia Sinica, Nankang, Taiwan; Department of Geology, Chinese Culture University, Yangming Shan, Taipei, Taiwan",USA;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,USA,USA,3,2.0,1.0,"Wang, C.-Y.; Department of Earth/Planetary Sci., , Berkeley, CA, United States",,NA NA,Earthequake;  Groundwater;  Taiwan,10.1111/j.1468-8123.2004.00082.x,Article,Chi-Chi earthquake 1999;  groundwater;  postseismic process;  temporal variation;  water level; Asia;  Eurasia;  Far East;  Taiwan,,Geofluids,58,4,scopus,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA;INSTITUTE OF EARTH SCIENCES;CHINESE CULTURE UNIVERSITY,DEPARTMENT OF EARTH/PLANETARY SCI.,B2

2008.0,Geofluids,Algorithm for determining optimum sequestration depth of CO2 trapped by residual gas and solubility trapping mechanisms in a deep saline formation,Lin C,"An algorithm is proposed here for determining the optimum sequestration depth (in terms of depth corresponding to maximum net income per unit rock volume) in a saline formation for CO2 trapped by residual gas and solubility trapping mechanisms. The Peng-Robinson equation of state was used to determine the density and fugacity of sequestered CO2 and the compression energy required for CO2 injection. Geochemist's Workbench((R)), a commercial geochemical software package, was used to estimate CO2 solubility in groundwater. Operational costs and CO2 emissions due to compression energy consumption were estimated. A hypothetical reference case was constructed to illustrate the proposed algorithm, assuming constant values of geothermal gradient, hydrostatic pressure gradient, sweep efficiency and initial groundwater chemistry, with a depth-dependent porosity and porosity-dependent saturation of residual gas. In general, the algorithm was illustrated successfully for the hypothetical reference case and produced the following results. The depth corresponding to maximum trapping capacity was approximately 3000 m, but the depth representing maximum net income was approximately 1300 m. CO2 emissions due to compression energy consumption per unit mass of CO2 sequestration cannot be ignored, but may be < 0.15, even down to a depth of 7000 m. Both the trapping capacity and net income of CO2 sequestration decreased with geothermal gradient, but the corresponding optimum depths increased with geothermal gradient.","Ind Technol Res Inst, Energy & Environm Res Labs, Resources Technol Div, Hsinchu 310, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,1,1.0,,"Lin, CK (corresponding author), Ind Technol Res Inst, Energy & Environm Res Labs, Resources Technol Div, Rm 110,Bldg 24,195 Sec 4,Chung Hsing Rd, Hsinchu 310, Taiwan.","Bureau of Energy of the Republic of China, Taiwan","This work was financially supported by the Bureau of Energy of the Republic of China, Taiwan, for which the author is very grateful.

2010.0,Geofluids,Estimation of methane flux offshore SW Taiwan and the influence of tectonics on gas hydrate accumulation,Chuang P;Yang T;Hong W;Lin S;Sun C;Lin A;Chen J;Wang Y;Chung S,"Widely distributed bottom simulating reflectors (BSRs) imply the potential existence of gas hydrates offshore southwestern Taiwan. To compare the distribution of methane concentrations along passive and active margins in the region, bottom waters and cored sediments were collected during four cruises from 2005 to 2006. The results reveal that sites with high methane concentrations are predominantly distributed in the active margin and site GS5 is the only site that contains very high methane concentrations in the passive margin of studied area. Anomalously high methane fluxes still can be obtained from the calculation of diffusive methane flux, although there might be some gas leakage during or after sampling procedures. The profiles of methane and sulfate concentration reveal very shallow depths of the sulfate-methane interface (SMI) at some sites. There is evidence that sulfate reduction is mainly driven by the process of anaerobic methane oxidation. Thus, sulfate fluxes can be used as a proxy for methane fluxes through the use of diffusion equations; and the results show that the fluxes are very high in offshore southwestern Taiwan. The depths of the SMI are different at sites GH6 and C; however, both methane profiles reveal parallel methane gradients below the SMI. This might be because of methane migration to surface sediments from the same reservoir with the same diffusion rates. Although BSRs are widely distributed both in the active margin and in the passive margin, most sites with high methane concentrations have been found in the active margin. Therefore, the specific tectonic settings in offshore SW Taiwan might strongly control the stability of gas hydrates, and thus affect the methane concentrations and fluxes of the sediments and sea waters. Furthermore, the carbon isotopic composition of methane shows that a biogenic gas source is dominant at shallower depth; however, some thermogenic gases might be introduced through the fracture/fault zones from deeper source in the active region of studied area.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei 106, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, Taipei 106, Taiwan.;  CPC, Explorat & Dev Res Inst, Miaoli City, Miaoli County, Taiwan.;  Natl Cent Univ, Inst Geophys, Jhongli, Taiwan.;  MOEA, Cent Geol Survey, Taipei, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,9,1.0,,"Yang, TF (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, 1,Sec 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 106, Taiwan.","Central Geological Survey of Taiwan, R.O.C.

2018.0,Geofluids,Consolidated and Undrained Ring Shear Tests on the Sliding Surface of the Hsiendushan Landslide in Taiwan,Lin H;Wu J;Sunarya E,"A new consolidated undrained ring shear test capable of measuring the pore pressures is presented to investigate the initiation mechanism of the Hsien-du-shan rock avalanche, triggered by Typhoon Morakot, in southern Taiwan. The postpeak state of the landslide surface between the Tangenshan sandstone and the remolded landslide gouge is discussed to address the unstable geomorphological precursors observed before the landslide occurred. Experimental results show that the internal friction angle of the high water content sliding surface in the total stress state, between 25.3 and 26.1 degrees, clarifies the reason of the stable slope prior to Typhoon Morakot. In addition, during the ring shear tests, it is observed that the excess pore pressure is generated by the shear contractions of the sliding surface. The remolded landslide gouge, sheared under the high normal stress, rendered results associated with high shear strength, small shear contraction, low hydraulic conductivity, and continuous excess pore pressure. The excess pore pressure feedback at the sliding surface may have accelerated the landslide.","Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Sustainable Environm Res Labs, Tainan, Taiwan.;  Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Tainan 701, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,1.0,"Wu, JH (corresponding author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Tainan 701, Taiwan.","National Science Council of TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [NSC 92-2211-E-426-003]; Ministry of Science and Technology of TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 107-2625-M-006-014]","The authors appreciate their colleagues in the rock laboratory of the Department of Civil Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan, for their kind help during rock gathering and sample preparations.

2018.0,Geofluids,Hydraulic Tomography for Estimating the Diffusivity of Heterogeneous Aquifers Based on Groundwater Response to Tidal Fluctuation in an Artificial Island in Taiwan,Wen J;Lin H;Yeh T;Wang Y;Lin K;Huang S,"This study investigated the hydraulic properties of the heterogeneous aquifers of an artificial island (Yunlin Offshore Industrial Park) in Taiwan. The research was based on the groundwater level response affected by tidal fluctuation using the hydraulic tomography (HT) to analyze the hydraulic diffusivity (alpha). Specifically, the power spectrum ratio of groundwater and tidal fluctuations derived fromtheGelhar solution was used to estimate alpha in homogeneous aquifers; this, however, could not be applied in the artificial island. Next, the spatial distribution of the groundwater level response affected by tidal fluctuation was analyzed and found to be irregular, proving the existence of hydrogeological heterogeneity in the artificial island. Furthermore, the results of the estimated alpha using the HT showed low error and high correlation, 0.41m(2)/hr and 0.83, respectively, between the optimal estimated heterogeneous and reference alpha fields in the synthetic aquifer. Last, the HT was used in the real tested scenario. By comparing the predicted groundwater levels of the optimal estimated heterogeneous alpha field and the observed groundwater levels of the real aquifer, it was found that the correlation was higher than 0.99. Therefore, theHTcanbe used to obtain the optimal estimated heterogeneous alpha field in the artificial island.","Natl Yunlin Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Safety Hlth & Environm Engn, Touliu, Yunlin, Taiwan.;  Natl Yunlin Univ Sci & Technol, Res Ctr Soil & Water Resources & Nat Disaster Pre, Touliu, Yunlin, Taiwan.;  Natl Yunlin Univ Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Engn Sci & Technol, Doctoral Program, Touliu, Yunlin, Taiwan.;  Univ Arizona, Dept Hydrol & Atmospher Sci, Tucson, AZ USA.;  AECOM Taiwan Corp, Dept Environm, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;USA;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,6,1.0,,"Huang, SY (corresponding author), Natl Yunlin Univ Sci & Technol, Res Ctr Soil & Water Resources & Nat Disaster Pre, Touliu, Yunlin, Taiwan.","Minister of Science and Technology, Taiwan [NSC 101-2221-E-224-050, NSC 102-2221-E-224-050, MOST 103-2221-E-224-054, MOST 104-2221-E-224-039, MOST 105-2625-M-224-002, 106-2119-M-224-001]; Department of Education, China; Global Expert award through Tianjin Normal University from the Thousand Talents Plan of Tianjin City; NSF EAR Grant [1014594]; U.S. Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP) Grant [ER-201212]","Jet-Chau Wen would like to acknowledge the research support from NSC 101-2221-E-224-050, NSC 102-2221-E-224-050, MOST 103-2221-E-224-054, MOST 104-2221-E-224-039, MOST 105-2625-M-224-002, and 106-2119-M-224-001 by the Minister of Science and Technology, Taiwan.

These changes are associated with rainfall-driven landslides and can be evaluated through observations of sediment transported in river water. In this study, we assess the differential impact level and duration of an extreme rainfall event caused by the 2009 Typhoon Morakot in Taiwan. Using a time series of suspended sediment data and landslide inventories within three affected catchments, our results found that the proportion of the typhoon-generated sediment discharges reached 58% of the 2009 annual sediment discharges, and the annual sediment discharges could be 15-fold higher than the average annual sediment discharges prior to the typhoon. The impact of the typhoon on suspended sediment discharge lasted for around four months. It is further revealed that a significant increase in the number of landslides was attributed to the impact of the extreme typhoon event, and the critical rainfall condition triggering landslides, based on the relationship between rainfall and landslide number and the rainfall intensity-duration thresholds, declined for 4-5 years.","Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Civil Engn, 1 Univ Rd, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.;  Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Earth Sci, 1 Univ Rd, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.;  Natl Sci & Technol Ctr Disaster Reduct, 200,Sec 3,Beixin Rd, New Taipei, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, 1,Sect 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,6,1.0,1.0,"Lin, GW (corresponding author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Earth Sci, 1 Univ Rd, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and Technology in TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan.

2018.0,Geofluids,Numerical Investigation of RainfallInduced Landslide in Mudstone Using Coupled Finite and Discrete Element Analysis,Hung C;Liu C;Chang C,"In this study, the role of water infiltration on a rainfall-induced landslide in mudstone is investigated. Finite element analysis (FEA) and discrete element analysis (DEA) were employed to explore the driving mechanism in the prefailure regime and the dynamic runout process in the postfailure regime, respectively. The driving mechanism was revealed in terms of the pore water pressures, saturation, and displacement of the sliding zone. To account for water infiltration associated with the dynamic runout process of the landsliding, the sliding friction coefficient in DEA was examined. Based on the results, satisfactory agreement between the numerical analysis and landslide behavior was realized. In prefailure regime, the onset of landslide initiation was found through assessment of rapid change of source displacement (RCSD). The estimated seepage force was about 0.5 N at landslide initiation. In postfailure regime, the results demonstrate that water infiltration and transition in steepness play significant roles in the behavior of the dynamic runout process. The landsliding exhibited a maximum speed of 4.41 m/s and decelerated as it reached a more gentle slope. Overall, the study indicated that the coupling of FEA and DEA can be used to investigate the role of water infiltration and provide useful insights. The approach can be further applied for studies on many other rainfall-induced geohazards to disclose the role of water infiltration with the prefailure and postfailure characteristics.","Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Civil Engn, 1 Univ Rd, Tainan, Taiwan.;  Kyoto Univ, Disaster Prevent Res Inst, Uji, Kyoto, Japan.;",TAIWAN;JAPAN,TAIWAN,JAPAN,3,1.0,1.0,"Hung, C (corresponding author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Civil Engn, 1 Univ Rd, Tainan, Taiwan.; Hung, C (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Disaster Prevent Res Inst, Uji, Kyoto, Japan.","Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) in TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [107-2636-E-006-003, 106-2221-E-006-061]; Headquarters of University Advancement at the National Cheng Kung University - Ministry of Education, Taiwan, ROC","The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) in Taiwan: Grants 107-2636-E-006-003 and 106-2221-E-006-061.

2019.0,Geofluids,Dimensionless Assessment Method of Landslide Dam Formation Caused by Tributary Debris Flow Events,Chen K;Chen X;Hu G;Kuo Y;Huang Y;Shieh C,"In this study, we develop a dimensionless assessment method to evaluate landslide dam formation by considering the relationship between the run-out distance of a tributary debris flow and the width of the main stream, deposition thickness of the tributary debris flow, and the water depth of the main stream. Based on the theory of debris flow run-out distance and fan formation, landslide dam formation may result from a tributary debris flow as a result of two concurrent formation processes: (1) the runout distance of the tributary debris flow must be greater than the width of the main stream, and (2) the minimum deposition thickness of the tributary debris flow must be higher than the in situ water depth of the main stream. At the confluence, one of four types of depositional scenarios may result: (1) the tributary debris flow enters into the main stream and forms a landslide dam; (2) the tributary debris flow enters into the main stream but overflow occurs, thus preventing complete blockage of the main stream; (3) the tributary debris flow enters into the main stream, does not reach the far bank, and sediment remains partially above the water elevation of the main stream; or (4) the tributary debris flow enters into the main stream, does not reach the far bank, and sediment is fully submerged in the main stream. This method was applied to the analysis of 11 tributary debris flow events during Typhoon Morakot, and the results indicate that the dimensionless assessment method can be used to estimate potential areas of landslide dam formation caused by tributary debris flows. Based on this method, government authorities can determine potential areas of landslide dam formation caused by debris flows and mitigate possible disasters accordingly through a properly prepared response plan, especially for early identification.","Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Mt Hazards & Environm, Key Lab Mt Hazards & Earth Surface Proc, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China.;  Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Hydraul & Ocean Engn, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.;",CHINA;TAIWAN,CHINA,CHINA,6,2.0,2.0,"Chen, XQ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Mt Hazards & Environm, Key Lab Mt Hazards & Earth Surface Proc, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China.","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41501012, 41661144028]; CAS ""Light of West China"" Program; Chinese Academy of Science and Technology Service Network Planning [KFJ-STS-ZDTP-015]","We thank two anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments on an earlier version of this manuscript.

2019.0,Geofluids,Gamma Ray and Radon Anomalies in Northern Taiwan as a Possible Preearthquake Indicator around the Plate Boundary,Fu C;Lee L;Yang T;Lin C;Chen C;Walia V;Liu T;Ouzounov D;Giuliani G;Lai T;Wang P,"Taiwan is tectonically situated in an oblique collision zone between the Philippine Sea Plate (PSP) and the Eurasian Plate (EP). Continuous observations of gamma rays at the Yangmingshan (YMSG) station and soil radon at the Tapingti (TPT) station were recorded in the volcanic area and around a major fault zone, respectively, in Taiwan for seismic studies. A number of anomalous high gamma ray counts and radon concentrations at certain times were found. It is noted that significant increases of soil radon concentrations were observed and followed by the increase in gamma rays a few days to a few weeks before earthquakes that occurred in northeastern Taiwan. Earthquakes such as these are usually related to the subduction of the PSP beneath the EP to the north along the subduction zone in northern Taiwan (e.g., ML=6.4, April 20, 2015). It is suggested that the preseismic activity may be associated with slow geodynamic processes at the subduction interface, leading to the PSP movement triggering radon enhancements at the TPT station. Furthermore, the further movement of the PSP might be blocked by the EP, with the accumulated elastic stress resulting in the increase of gamma rays due to the increase in porosity and fractures below the YMSG station. The continuous monitoring of the multiple parameters can improve the understanding of the relationship between the observed radon and gamma ray variations and the regional crustal stress/strain in north and northeastern Taiwan.","Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei, Taiwan.;  NARL, Natl Ctr Res Earthquake Engn, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Chapman Univ, One Univ Dr, Orange, CA USA.;  Permanent Fdn G Giuliani, Laquila, Italy.;  MOEA, Cent Geol Survey, Taipei, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;USA;ITALY;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,11,1.0,1.0,"Fu, CC (corresponding author), Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST)Ministry of Science and Technology, China [MOST 107-2116-M-002-019]; Central Weather Bureau (CWB), Taiwan [MOTC-CWB-106-E-01]","We dedicate this paper to the late Prof. Tsanyao Frank Yang (TFY), who passed away on the 12th of March 2015.

2019.0,Geofluids,Towards Automated RealTime Detection and Location of LargeScale Landslides through Seismic Waveform Back Projection,Lee E;Liao W;Lin G;Chen P;Mu D;Lin C,"Rainfall-triggered landslides are one of the most deadly natural hazards in many regions. Seismic recordings have been used to examine source mechanisms and to develop monitoring systems of landslides. We present a semiautomatic algorithm for detecting and locating landslide events using both broadband and short-period recordings and have successfully applied our system to landslides in Taiwan. Compared to local earthquake recordings, the recordings of landslides usually show longer durations and lack distinctive P and S wave arrivals; therefore, the back projection method is adopted for the landslide detection and location. To identify the potential landslide events, the seismic recordings are band-passed from 1 to 3Hz and the spectrum pattern in the time-frequency domain is used to distinguish landslides from other types of seismic sources based upon carefully selected empirical criteria. Satellite images before and after the detected and located landslide events are used for final confirmation. Our landslide detection and spatial-temporal location system could potentially benefit the establishment of rainfall-triggered landslide forecast models and provide more reliable constraints for physics-based landslide modeling. The accumulating seismic recordings of landslide events could be used as a training dataset for machine learning techniques, which will allow us to fully automate our system in the near future.","Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Earth Sci, 1 Univ Rd, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.;  Univ Wyoming, Dept Geol & Geophys, Dept 3006, 1000 E Univ Ave, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.;  Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego Supercomp Ctr, 10100 Hopkins Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.;",TAIWAN;USA;USA,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,6,1.0,1.0,"Lin, GW (corresponding author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Earth Sci, 1 Univ Rd, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and Technology, R.O.C.

2008.0,Geogr. Inf. Sci.,Using multiscale spatial data in landslide mornitoring and landuse classification interpretation,Chou T;Liu C;Yeh M;Chen Y,"Owing to the rapid developments in the field of Geographic Information Systems and Remote Sensing techniques, various images sources have been widely available to identify ground changes information. Those commonly used multi-scale images provide the sources from macro to micro information and can be served as basic analysis platform in landslide monitoring and land use classification. Taiwan has a unique and vulnerable geological condition with potential disasters easily triggered by landslide occurrence due to typhoon and heavy precipitation each summer season. In order to identify and analyze those landslide information temporary and spatially, this research integrate satellite images, aerial survey data from aviation photography and LIDAR, and remotely controlled helicopter techniques to set up a diverse information network. Satellite images can fulfill the need for large area environmental inventory and land use classification. Digital Terrain Model generated by LIDAR and aerial photos can be used to mark the landslide area and estimate the size and volume. Remotely controlled helicopter can overcome the barriers of site accessibility and data transmitting simultaneously. This network then provides a less time and cost consuming platform by the idea of Grid methodology. The output from this research demonstrates the integration of heterogeneous data into a uniform communication interface to construct a thorough analysis mechanism. It is applicable and feasible to monitor the vegetation, terrain, and landscape changes through land use and land cover identification by multi-scale spatial data. © 2008 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Department of Land Management, GIS Research Center, Feng Chia University, 100 Wenhwa Rd., Taichung, Taiwan; Institute of Civil and Hydraulic Engineering, Feng Chia University, Taiwan; GIS Research Center, Feng Chia University, Taichung, Taiwan; GIS Research Center, Feng Chia University, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,4,1.0,0.0,,,NA NA NA,Aerial photogrammetry;  Grid;  LIDAR;  Multi-scale image;  RS,10.1080/10824000809480636,Article,,,Geographic Information Sciences,0,14,scopus,,,B2
2012.0,Geogr. J.,Micropolitical and related barriers to stakeholder engagement in flood risk management,Tseng C;Penning-Rowsell E,"Modern conceptualisations of flood risk management (FRM) embody the active engagement of citizens in the appraisal of risk and the development of risk reducing options. But such engagement is known not to be easy. The relevant literature suggests that the potential barriers to stakeholder engagement in FRM are conventionally theorised in three categories: stakeholder-based barriers; time-related barriers; and barriers caused by power inequalities. This paper describes research exploring these issues, by critiquing existing ideas about the barriers to stakeholder engagement in FRM and elsewhere, and by using a case study from Taiwan. Using in-depth interviews of stakeholders we found that failure to acknowledge and take account of the micro-politics in the engagement process brought about new impediments to participation: power sharing unexpectedly created new barriers. We conclude that these results may have relevance elsewhere but that conflicts will remain as long as there are choices to be made. Stakeholder engagement is about resolving these conflicts, but the promoters of flood risk reducing interventions need to be much more analytical in their efforts to understand the 'micro-political positions' of all the stakeholders they encounter, rather than see such differences as themselves inherently problematic. © 2012 The Authors.

2016.0,Geogr. J.,Indexing livelihood vulnerability to the effects of typhoons in indigenous communities in Taiwan,Lin K;Polsky C,"The theoretical importance of understanding how livelihoods shape local vulnerability to the effects of climate change has received broad attention, but with relatively few attempts to produce and implement an analytical framework based on the theory. This study develops a livelihood vulnerability analytical framework, and applies it to the case of rural indigenous communities of Taiwan that are regularly exposed to typhoons and associated geological hazards. Measures of the factors influencing how typhoons impact these indigenous communities (sensitivities), and of the abilities of such communities to respond in anticipatory or reactive modes (adaptive capacities) are also included. The study is based on mixed qualitative and quantitative analysis, combining data from in-person interviews and surveys from 2006 to 2009. Livelihood vulnerability narratives are developed accordingly, together with a spatially-explicit livelihood vulnerability index to diagnose the dimensionality and the distribution of vulnerability across the area. Three patterns of livelihood vulnerability are found including least vulnerable communities in the remotest area with relatively abundant livelihood capitals to mitigate vulnerability, intermediate vulnerability communities which are doubly exposed to market and typhoon-associated stresses, and the most vulnerable communities trapped in poverty and vulnerability loops. The patterns reveal strong spatial relationships of social development beginning with the Japanese colonial government (1895-1945) and continuing through the Kuomintang Chinese government (1945-present). This historical development shaped the original human-environmental conditions in each community and the inequality continues to expand due to increased hazard risk and inappropriate policy interventions. This study highlights the need for future research to develop a continuous program for longitudinally tracking the dynamism of the three patterns of vulnerability. © 2016 Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers).","George Perkins Marsh Institute, Clark University, 950 Main St, Worcester, MA  01610, United States; Research Center for Environmental Changes, Academia Sinica, 128 Academia Road, Section 2, Nankang, Taipei, Taiwan; Center for Environmental Studies, Florida Atlantic University, 3200 College Ave., DW-312, Davie, FL  33314, United States",USA;TAIWAN;USA,USA,USA,2,2.0,,"Lin, K.-H.E.; George Perkins Marsh Institute, 950 Main St, United States; 電子郵件: khelin@gate.sinica.edu.tw",,NA NA NA NA,Indigenous communities;  Livelihoods;  Taiwan;  Typhoon hazard;  Vulnerability assessment,10.1111/geoj.12141,Article,geological hazard;  hazard assessment;  indigenous population;  nature-society relations;  rural society;  typhoon;  vulnerability; Taiwan,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,Geographical Journal,17,182,scopus,CLARK UNIVERSITY;ACADEMIA SINICA;FLORIDA ATLANTIC UNIVERSITY,GEORGE PERKINS MARSH INSTITUTE,A
2020.0,Geogr. J.,Anxiety of food nationalism Dilemmas of bordering in the VietnamTaiwan tea trade,Hung P;Lien Y,"In Taiwan, bentu (or bendi) is a term emphasizing local food and agriculture, similar to “localness” in the concept of local food systems (LFS). The term also demonstrates the complex, inseparable relationship between local food movements and food nationalism in Taiwan. This paper examines the politics of bentu in Taiwan's food movements in order to reconsider the relationship between the relocalization of agri-food systems and the politics of bordering regarding food nationalism. This approach chimes with recent scholarship concerned with relocating border studies, in political geography in particular, and provides a way of critically understanding the borderwork that takes place beyond the national borders. We use the case of the tea trade between Vietnam and Taiwan to illustrate how borders around bentu food products can be simultaneously porous and fixed. During the 1990s Taiwanese entrepreneurs and tea merchants established tea plantations and factories in Vietnam to meet increasing Taiwanese market demand. However, Vietnamese tea has been stigmatized as inferior due to concerns about pesticide residue and quality control. Yet while bentu protectionists of Taiwanese tea have drawn and re-drawn the symbolic and spatial borders to constrain the mobility of Vietnamese tea, tea producers in Vietnam have practised a variety of strategies to re-mobilize their tea to cross spatial and symbolic borders into Taiwan. Thus, we argue, the “movement” of bentu food encompasses two dimensions: a social movement to fix the boundaries of local tea for food nationalism, and movement as the discrepant patterns of mobility of both humans and non-humans – tea producers and tea trees in our case – that can challenge attempts to shore up a purified vision of the bentu. As such, bentu has been a mechanism for the construction of a symbolically distinct but spatially blurred space for Taiwanese tea.

2021.0,Geogr. J.,Performing and counterperforming organic food markets in East Asia The role of ahimsa scientific knowledge and faith groups,Wang C,"Inspired by Japanese faith groups, organic food production has witnessed surprising growth in East Asian countries, such as Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea, over the past two decades. The rapid expansion of East Asian trans-national organic food production networks is closely linked with religious practices and beliefs, such as ahimsa (non-killing). The complexities of transnational organic production networks in East Asia cannot be adequately captured by the existing literature on “conventionalisation of organic agriculture,” which repeatedly debates the extent to which capitalism intrudes on the social and biophysical dimensions of farming. I argue that this simplified and binary debate tends to treat the organic market as an unquestioned, stabilised, and universalised artefact. Less attention has been paid to questions such as, how do alternative food markets come into being, stabilise or get crushed? Inspired by the social studies of economisation and marketisation (SSEM) approach, this paper urges scholars to move beyond the conventionalisation debate and draws attention to the organic food market-making practices. Taking inspiration from SSEM thinking, I propose that more emphasis needs to be placed on the performation struggles, which refers to the confrontations between different economic programmes and actors. By drawing attention to the organic market performation struggles in Japan and Taiwan, this paper argues that organic food market-making is a global heterogeneous assemblage, in which all human and non-human actants across multi-scalar geographies, such as trans-local religious/scientific knowledge, believers, and so on, can contribute to the making and remaking of markets. With reference to qualitative interviews with organic distributors and practitioners, this paper deepens the knowledge of the geographies of marketisation in a global-relational context.

2006.0,Geogr. Res. Forum,A regional perspective on tourism development of small islands in Taiwan A case study of the Penghu Islands,Ni C;Chang C,"The Penghu Islands have developed a tourism industry for more than 30 years, and the other remote Taiwan's small islands such as Kinmen (Quemoy), Matsu, Lu (Green), Hsiao-Liuchiu (Small Ryukyus), Lanyu (Orchid), Kueishan and Keelung have also been promoting tourism in recent years. Islands in nearby foreign countries such as Bali, Phuket, Okinawa, Guam, and Palau have also been attracting many tourists from Taiwan. This paper examines tourism development in the Penghu Islands from public and private sector perspectives both of which are being promoted rapidly because of tourism demands. Tourism development of Taiwan's small islands is in a condition of 'spatial alternation'. More competition between Taiwan's small islands and those in neighboring countries for tourists is becoming obvious. However, tourism development in the Penghu Islands has a bright future, not only because there are adequate supports of the public sector, good marketing of the private sector, and high demand of tourists, but also they already have greater international visibility.","Department of Regional Studies in Humanity and Social Sciences, National Hsinchu University of Education, Hsinchu, Taiwan; Department of Geography, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,,"Ni, C.-C.; Department of Regional Studies in Humanity and Social Sciences, , Hsinchu, Taiwan; 電子郵件: ccni@mail.nhcue.edu.tw",,NA NA NA,Penghu;  Regional competition;  Small islands;  Spatial alternation;  Taiwan;  Tourism,,Article,demand analysis;  private sector;  public sector;  tourism development;  tourism market;  tourist attraction; Asia;  China;  Eurasia;  Far East;  Fujian;  Japan;  Keelung River;  Kinmen Islands;  Lanyu;  Matsu Islands;  Penghu Islands;  Ryukyu Islands;  Taiwan,,Geography Research Forum,1,26,scopus,NATIONAL HSINCHU UNIVERSITY OF EDUCATION;NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY,DEPARTMENT OF REGIONAL STUDIES IN HUMANITY AND SOCIAL SCIENCES,A
2006.0,Geogr. Res. Forum,Housing and single mothers in the KMT regime of Taiwan 19492000,Chen Y,"Demographic change, feminist movements and research in the First and Third Worlds have made the female-headed family a visible category in urban policies. The history of feminist spatial research marks a shift from the analyses of gender roles to gender relations. This research uses both approaches to analyze single mother's housing conditions in Taipe. First, it builds a gender category, and second, interprets gender inequality from the interaction between the productive and reproductive, public and private domains. It links housing with family, labor market structures, legal systems, and state policies to explore how their interactions produce and reproduce gender relations in Taiwan. In contrast to North American or English women's experiences, the status of Taiwanese women is dominated by a patrilineal family structure. The patrilineal principle in the public and private domain leads to Taiwanese women's inferior status in property rights, autonomy, family supports, economic status, and welfare. The housing policy of Taiwan, however, remained gender blind up un til the 1990s. This paper will reveal the housing conditions of single-mother families and explain their inferior housing conditions. Housing policies under the KMT regime from 1949 to 2000 distributed most of the resources to affluent home-buyers and the state's supporters, primarily military personnel government employees and developers. The social inequality in these policies not only increased the gap between rich and poor but also between men and women.","Department of Local Studies, National Hualien University of Education, 123 Hua-Si Road, Hualien City 970, Taiwan",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,1,1.0,,"Chen, Y.-L.; Department of Local Studies, 123 Hua-Si Road, Hualien City 970, Taiwan; 電子郵件: yiling@mail.nhlue.edu.tw",,NA NA NA,Feminist movement;  Gender relations;  Housing;  Single mother;  Taiwan,,Article,demographic transition;  female headed household;  feminism;  gender relations;  gender role;  housing conditions;  labor market;  womens status; Asia;  Eurasia;  Far East;  North America;  Taipei;  Taiwan,,Geography Research Forum,6,26,scopus,NATIONAL HUALIEN UNIVERSITY OF EDUCATION,NOTREPORTED,A

It illustrates the experiences of cross-border capital flow from the newly industrializing economies (NIE's) and their potential effects on the transformation of the global economic system. It is found that Taiwan's foreign direct investment has been carried out mainly by manufacturing-based entrepreneurs to establish transnational production networks with multi-national investment sites in the second-tier industrializing economies of the same region since the mid-1980s to sustain their exported-oriented production.

However, a high home ownership rate among Taiwanese migrants has been found. Their locational choice depends on income and housing budget, proximity to good schools and shopping centers, and information from friends or earlier migrants. This paper also addresses the experiences and types of problems faced by middle-class Taiwanese immigrant women in ""astronaut"" households. Being excluded from the labor market, the women tried to balance the needs of the husbands and the children, and suffer a number of disadvantages in their new environment, while on the other hand frequently enjoyed an autonomy and freedom from their familial responsibilities in Taiwan. A new pattern of circular Chinese diaspora was found among the young first generation Taiwanese immigrants to Australia as they returned after finishing their tertiary education in Australia. Reunions with their families in Taiwan, search for potential spouse, and their affection towards Taiwan had all been important factors to affect their decisions. They had developed a dual identity that encompassed Taiwanese and Australian cultures, due to their constant need to adapt to both societies.","Department of Geography, Taiwan National University, Taipei, Taiwan; Australian Studies Center, NTU, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Social Studies Education, Taipei Municipal University of Education, Taipei, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;AUSTRALIA;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,,"Chiang, L.-H.N.; Australian Studies Center, , Taipei, Taiwan; 電子郵件: nora@ntu.edu.tw",,NA NA NA,Australia;  Circular Taiwanese diaspora;  Dual identity;  Employment;  Lone mothers;  Residential mobility;  Young first generation,,Article,diaspora;  employment;  immigrant;  labor market;  labor migration;  migrants experience;  residential mobility;  settlement pattern; Asia;  Australasia;  Australia;  Eurasia;  Far East;  Taiwan,,Geography Research Forum,13,26,scopus,TAIWAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY;AUSTRALIAN STUDIES CENTER;TAIPEI MUNICIPAL UNIVERSITY OF EDUCATION,AUSTRALIAN STUDIES CENTER,A

Forum,The dynamics of labor migration in Taiwan Evidence from the 1990 and 2000 Taiwan Population Censuses,Lin J,"Based mainly on the 1990 and 2000 Taiwan Population Censuses, this research is intended to ascertain the dynamic features of labor migration and to assess its impact on regional human capital during the past two decades. In light of very low fertility and mortality rates, the growth of Taiwan's population has been gradually affected by growing international migration, with the metropolitan areas in northern Taiwan as the most favored destination. As opposed to the 1980s and early 1990s, the northern region has diminished substantially in attracting labor migrants; the most salient phenomenon could be attributed to the substantial outflows of long-distance labor migrants with less human capital from the Taipei area to agricultural prefectures in the central and southern regions. In spite of experiencing a transition from a net gain to a net loss of labor, the overall human capital in terms of quality in the northern region continues to benefit from the process of migration, as opposed to the situation in the remaining regions. The net loss of the less-educated domestic labor migrants in the Taipei area of the northern region is most likely due to the pushing effect on internal out-migration and discouraging effect on internal in-migration associated with voluminous concentration of immigrants in northern Taiwan.","Research Center for Humanities and Social Sciences (RCHSS), Academia Sinica, Nankang, Taipei 115, Taiwan",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,1,1.0,,"Lin, J.-P.; Research Center for Humanities and Social Sciences (RCHSS), , Nankang, Taipei 115, Taiwan; 電子郵件: jplin@gate.sinica.edu.tw",,NA NA NA,Internal migration;  International migration;  Labor migration;  Migration dynamics;  Regional development;  Taiwan,,Article,census;  human capital;  immigrant;  internal migration;  international migration;  labor migration;  metropolitan area;  regional development; Asia;  Eurasia;  Far East;  Taipei;  Taiwan,,Geography Research Forum,3,26,scopus,ACADEMIA SINICA,RESEARCH CENTER FOR HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES (RCHSS),A

In spite of being praised as a model of the developmental state, the Taiwanese government was very conservative in its financial policy, and usually put a high priority on stable growth in its decision making. As a result, it took an ambivalent attitude toward the opening of the futures market, which was believed to be highly speculative and subversive to the financial system. However, an underground futures market came into de facto existence and caused social concerns, and the state was forced to legalize the new industry. Even so, instead of following a big push model, the state adopted a gradualist approach and opened the trading market step by step. This led to creation of a market dominated by individual investors and little foreign capital participation. The market was characterized as decentralized and price sensitive to service charges, and at the same time, required brokers to bridge the knowledge gap for individual investors, rather than institutional ones, in complex financial transactions. Under such circumstances, it was the extent of social networks, rather than the sophistication of trading skills, that was critical in the business. In other words, reluctant state policies led to a decentralized market structure, which further shaped an under-developed professional community in Taiwan's futures trading industry.","Department of Geography, National Taiwan University, 1 Roosevelt Road, Taipei 106, Taiwan; Center for Environment, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford OX1 3QY, United Kingdom",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;UNITED KINGDOM,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,,"Hsu, J.-Y.; Department of Geography, 1 Roosevelt Road, Taipei 106, Taiwan; 電子郵件: jinnyuh@ntu.edu.tw",,NA NA NA,Developmental state;  Financial geography;  Financial services;  Futures trading;  Globalization;  Informaiton and communications technology (ICT);  Taiwan,,Article,capital;  decentralization;  decision making;  financial policy;  financial system;  globalization;  market system;  social network;  state led development,,Geography Research Forum,2,26,scopus,NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY;UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD,NOTREPORTED,A

Sketched mental maps and GIS 3D virtual environment (VE) are used by indigenous elders and hunters to delineate their traditional territories. Spatial components representing the predominant spatial elements are identified. Spatial structures used for locational positioning are analyzed, as are spatial reference systems for orientation and movement. The results show that spatial components are used for daily activities, as well as having historical and cultural meaning; a quadrant structure is used for spatial positioning; and instead of using the directional reference system of east, south, west, and north, these indigenous people rely on the orientation analogies of uphill, downhill, upstream, and downstream for direction. © 2013 by the American Geographical Society of New York.","National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan; Institute of Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology, Leiden University, Netherlands",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;NETHERLANDS,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,,"Tsai, B.-W.; National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan; 電子郵件: tsaibw@ntu.edu.tw",,NA NA NA,Austronesian;  Indigenous peoples;  Mental maps;  Spatial knowledge;  Taiwan,10.1111/j.1931-0846.2013.00005.x,Article,GIS;  indigenous knowledge;  indigenous population;  map;  mountain environment;  spatial analysis;  spatial planning;  three-dimensional modeling; Taiwan,,Geographical Review,7,103,scopus,NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY;LEIDEN UNIVERSITY,NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY,A
2006.0,Geogr. Rev. Jpn.,Taiwans bananaproducing regions and the Japanese market,Koseki Y,"Taiwan's banana industry developed during the period of Japanese occupation, and Taiwan bananas monopolized the Japanese market until banana importation was liberalized in 1963. This paper examines the development of Taiwan's banana-producing regions by highlighting the relationship between Taiwan bananas and the Japanese market and the change in banana-producing regions of Taiwan following the end of World War II. Before Japan colonized Taiwan in 1895, bananas were a subsistence crop mainly in northern Taiwan. However, during the colonial period, a commercial banana-producing region was formed in central Taiwan around Jiji. After World War II, while the colonial banana network was maintained, the production center moved southward to Chishan town, where bananas are mainly grown for the Japanese market. Both banana-producing regions are now facing such problems as the aging of farmers, shortage of successors, crop diseases, and typhoon damage. Besides, a price competition war in the Japanese market forces Taiwan growers to raise their competitiveness. By joining WTO, further reorganization of banana-producing regions is expected in Taiwan.","Department of Geography, National Taiwan Normal University, Taipei 106, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,1,1.0,,"Koseki, Y.; Department of Geography, , Taipei 106, Taiwan",,NA NA NA,Banana;  Banana networks;  Banana-producing region;  Japanese colonization;  Taiwan;  World Trage Organization,10.4157/grj.79.5_216,Article,agricultural market;  colonialism;  crop production; Asia;  Eurasia;  Far East;  Japan;  Taiwan,Association of Japanese Geographers,Geographical Review of Japan,2,79,scopus,NATIONAL TAIWAN NORMAL UNIVERSITY,NOTREPORTED,A

The area is surrounded by two rural villages; each has a branch of elementary school. Given research looks into the way how these communities and schools collaborated on planning and implementing common community development projects. It also focuses on analyzing the process and outcomes of setting up a school-community-university partnership platform for conducting collaborative projects. Through regular panel discussions during platform meetings and training workshops, local people and school teachers managed to work out a common ground for their interests and goals. They cooperated in drawing up and carrying out several geoconservation and geotourism projects aimed at enhancing a better understanding of relationships between the livelihoods of local people and the badlands resources. The image of badlands, which was originally negatively perceived by the local people, now was viewed as the local community's resource with a positive impact on tourism development. School-community-university partnership platform proved to be an efficient tool in stimulating knowledge resources, relational resources, and mobilization capacity among the local stakeholders, while advancing geoconservation and rural community development.","Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Studies, 1,Sec 2,Da Hsueh Rd, Hualien 97401, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,1,1.0,,"Lee, KC (corresponding author), Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Studies, 1,Sec 2,Da Hsueh Rd, Hualien 97401, Taiwan.",,,Geoconservation; Geotourism; Rural community development; School-community-university partnership; Participatory forum,10.1007/s12371-020-00443-w,Article,LICHI MELANGE; EVOLUTION,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,GEOHERITAGE,0,12,ISI,NATL DONG HWA UNIV,NATL DONG HWA UNIV,A
2020.0,Geol. Geofiz. Uga. Ross,Progress of soil nonlinearity researches of recent years in Russia and Taiwan,Huang J;Zaalishvili V;Melkov D;Kuo C;Wen K;Chen C,"Relevance. Soil nonlinearity has a significant influence on result seismic effect at strong motions which differ from weak and moderate ones. Practice of construction faced with adequate account of nonlinear effect in weak soils and demand techniques for design parameters assessment. Researches of recent years in the field of soil nonlinearity may enrich each other and find the main way for effective practices and building codes regularization. The aim of this work is allocation of parameters for nonlinearity description and corresponding techniques development. Methods. Field soil response analysis with sources of different power in conjunction with strong motion records were analyzed by means of regression analysis and other machine learning techniques. Mathematical modeling includes multiple reflected waves analysis technique and finite elements modeling. Results. The parameters that are closely related to the absorption and soil nonlinearity were identified. The empirical formulas connecting the areas of normalized and real spectra with the parameters of seismic loadings were obtained using regression analysis. The differences of absorption mechanism in dispersed (soft) and rocky soils were defined. Conclusion. The models of ground strata behavior in the case of variable intensity of dynamic action on the basis of consideration of the real area of the spectrum and the average value of the frequency, characterized by a linear and nonlinear elastic-inelastic deformation of the soils are offered. Degree of nonlinearity (DNL) metric may be efficiently used for stress-strain curve assessment, and in the absence of strong earthquakes records it can be applied for powerful seismic sources records analysis what determines the direction of future research. © 2020, Geophysical Institute of the Vladikavkaz Scientific Centre of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

2001.0,Geol.

However, understanding the nature and origin of mélanges is crucial to deciphering the evolution of some mountain belts. The Lichi Mélange of the Taiwan Coastal Range is juxtaposed against remnant forearc basin sequences by thrust faults and is composed of exotic ophiolite and sedimentary blocks, with sizes ranging from metres to kilometres, and coherent turbidite beds, all embedded in a sheared scaly argillaceous matrix. The Lichi Mélange has been interpreted either as a subduction complex, or as an olistostrome. By separating four main deformation levels based on the degree of disruption within the Lichi Mélange and adjacent sedimentary rocks, we have made new detailed geological maps and structural profiles in two key areas of the Lichi Mélange. We paid particular attention to the original stratigraphic relationships between the mélange and the adjacent flysch formation. Our field results compared with submarine seismic profiles suggest that the present-day structure of the Lichi Mélange results mainly from the shearing of lower forearc basin sequences, rather than from a subduction complex or a mere olistostrome. In Late Miocene time, because lithospheric subduction turned into arc-continent collision in the southern Taiwan area, the site of the proto-Manila trench changed from an active plate boundary into a deformation zone with several thrusts. A new plate suture zone between the Eurasian plate (eastern Central Range) and the Philippine Sea plate (Coastal Range) was therefore formed along the Longitudinal Valley. The Longitudinal Valley originated as a submarine arc-prism boundary, an innate weak zone within the overriding plate, and has become a prominent tectonic feature of the arc-continent collision. This inference is supported by observations on the Lichi Mélange in the Coastal Range and the Huatung Ridge off southeastern Taiwan.","Laboratoire de Tectonique Quantitative, Université P. and M.

2016.0,Geol. Mag.,The role of basementinvolved normal faults in the recent tectonics of western Taiwan,Yang K;Rau R;Chang H;Hsieh C;Ting H;Huang S;Wu J;Tang Y,"In the foreland area of western Taiwan, some of the pre-orogenic basement-involved normal faults were reactivated during the subsequent compressional tectonics. The main purpose of this paper is to investigate the role played by the pre-existing normal faults in the recent tectonics of western Taiwan. In NW Taiwan, reactivated normal faults with a strike-slip component have developed by linkage of reactivated single pre-existing normal faults in the foreland basin and acted as transverse structures for low-angle thrusts in the outer fold-and-thrust belt. In the later stage of their development, the transverse structures were thrusted and appear underneath the low-angle thrusts or became tear faults in the inner fold-and-thrust belt. In SW Taiwan, where the foreland basin is lacking normal fault reactivation, the pre-existing normal faults passively acted as ramp for the low-angle thrusts in the inner fold-and-thrust belt. Some of the active faults in western Taiwan may also be related to reactivated normal faults with right-lateral slip component. Some main earthquake shocks related to either strike-slip or thrust fault plane solution occurred on reactivated normal faults, implying a relationship between the pre-existing normal fault and the triggering of the recent major earthquakes. Along-strike contrast in structural style of normal fault reactivation gives rise to different characteristics of the deformation front for different parts of the foreland area in western Taiwan. Variations in the degree of normal fault reactivation also provide some insights into the way the crust embedding the pre-existing normal faults deformed in response to orogenic contraction.","Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Earth Sci, 1 Univ Rd, Tainan 701, Taiwan.;  Formosa Petrochem Corp, Oil & Gas E&P Dept, 201 Dun Hua N Rd, Taipei 105, Taiwan.;  CPC Corp, Explorat & Dev Res Inst, 1 Ta Yuan,Wen Fa Rd, Miaoli 36042, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,8,1.0,1.0,"Yang, KM (corresponding author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Earth Sci, 1 Univ Rd, Tainan 701, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan Government [MOST 103-3113-E-006-012, MOST 105-2119-M-865-002]; Exploration and Development Research Institute, CPC Corporation, Taiwan [FED0111001]","The authors would like to thank Exploration and Development Research Institute, CPC Corporation, Taiwan for providing invaluable well-bore and seismic data and their long-term support of this study.

2017.0,Geol. Mag.,Age and tectonic setting of the East Taiwan Ophiolite implications for the growth and development of the South China Sea,Hsieh R;Shellnutt J;Yeh M,"The South China Sea is one of the youngest marginal seas and understanding its development is important for reconstructing the tectonic evolution of Southeast Asia. The South China Sea is thought to have been actively spreading between 32 Ma and 15.5 Ma. The East Taiwan Ophiolite (ETO) is one of the few preserved remnants of the South China Sea on land and provides an opportunity to investigate the age and the tectonic setting of the accreted easternmost portion. The age of the ETO was obtained by LA-ICP-MS in situ zircon U-Pb methods and yielded a mean Pb-206-U-238 age of 14.1 +/- 0.4 Ma, suggesting that magmatic activity in the South China Sea continued similar to 1.5 million years beyond current estimates. Cr-spinel data (Cr no. = 42-54) and depleted epsilon(Nd)(t) values (i.e. +9.1 to +11.4) from the serpentinized peridotites and gabbros and the light rare earth element depleted patterns (La/Yb <= 1) of the ETO mafic rocks are consistent with a ridge setting (i.e. N-MORB com-position). Therefore, the ETO likely represents the terminal portion of the South China Sea spreading ridge that was sheared off during the northward translation of the Luzon arc.","Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Earth Sci, 88 Tingzhou Rd Sect 4, Taipei 11677, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,1.0,"Shellnutt, JG (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Earth Sci, 88 Tingzhou Rd Sect 4, Taipei 11677, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and Technology (Taiwan)Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [102-2628-M-003-001-MY4]","We thank Scott Whattam, an anonymous reviewer and Phil Leat for important editorial comments.

2017.0,Geol. Mag.,Reassessment of the Mesozoic metasedimentary rocks and tectonic setting of Taiwan and the adjacent continental margin of eastern Asia,Wang Y;Tsai C;Zhou L;Qiu Y;Sun G,"It remains unclear whether a crystalline basement exists in SE China (including Taiwan), whether the formation of the Tananao metamorphic belt in Taiwan was linked to subduction of the Palaeo-Pacific Plate, and whether the source rocks of the sedimentary sequences in the metamorphic belts are late Mesozoic or Palaeozoic in age. Field investigations and zircon age data in the present study indicate that there is no pre-Palaeozoic gneiss (crystalline basement) in Taiwan (although orthogneisses were produced during deformation and metamorphism of Mesozoic granites), and investigations of the metasediments show that the sedimentary sequences in the Tailuko and Yuli belts are similar. Moreover, LA-ICP-MS dating of detrital zircons from the Pingtan-Dongshan belt in Fujian Province yields a cluster of Pb-206-U-238 ages at similar to 210-190 Ma, and the Tailuko and Yuli belts in Taiwan have similar clusters of detrital zircon ages at 200 Ma, 160 Ma, 120 Ma and 110 Ma, as well as a later overprinting caused by arc-continent collision. The cathodoluminescence images and trace-element characteristics of the zircons show that they were originally magmatic in origin. This finding, combined with the Hf isotope data, indicates that the sources of sediments in the Tananao belt (Tailuko and Yuli belts) were relatively close to an active continental margin, and that both the Tailuko and Yuli belts have similar sedimentary sources. From the margin of the Chinese mainland to Taiwan, the metasediments seem to represent a continuous sequence of deposits ranging in age from Jurassic to Cretaceous, but with the sediments becoming progressively younger towards the east. It can be inferred that the sediments in the Tailuko and Yuli belts were continental-shelf sequences with sources in SE China.","China Univ Geosci, Inst Earth Sci, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.;  Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Studies, Hualien, Taiwan.;  Guangzhou Marine Geol Survey, Inst Geol Invest, Guangzhou 510075, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;",CHINA;TAIWAN;CHINA,CHINA,CHINA,5,2.0,2.0,"Wang, Y (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci, Inst Earth Sci, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",Guangzhou Marine Geological Survey [GZH20110205]; China University of Geosciences (Beijing) [2011TDL001]; Chinese NSFNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [90914004],"We greatly appreciate the constructive comments and suggestions from editor of Geological Magazine Prof. M.

2021.0,Geol. Mag.,Deformation partitioning in mountain belts insights from analogue modelling experiments and the Taiwan collisional orogen,Malavieille J;Dominguez S;Lu C;Chen C;Konstantinovskaya E,"Many orogens on the planet result from plate convergence involving subduction of a continental margin. The lithosphere is strongly deformed during mountain building involving subduction of a plate composed generally of accreted continental margin units and some fragments of downgoing oceanic crust and mantle. A complex deformation involving strong partitioning of deformation modes and kinematics produces crustal shortening, accompanied by crustal thickening. Partitioning depends on three main factors: (1) rheologic layering of the lithosphere; (2) interaction between tectonics and surface processes; (3) subduction kinematics and 3D geometry of continental margins (oblique convergence, shape of indenters). Here we present an original view and discussion on the impact of deformation partitioning on the structure and evolution of orogens by examining the Taiwan mountain belt as a case study. Major unsolved questions are addressed through geological observations from the Taiwan orogen and insights from analogue models integrating surface processes. Some of these questions include: What is the role played by decollements or weak zones in crustal deformation and what is the impact of structural heterogeneities inherited from the early extensional history of a rifted passive continental margin? What is the relationship between deep underplating, induced uplift and flow of crustal material during erosion (finite strain evolution during wedge growth)? Are syn-convergent normal faults an effect of deformation partitioning and erosion? What is the role of strain partitioning on the location of major seismogenic faults in active mountain belts?

2001.0,Geol. Soc. Am. Bull.,Stratigraphic architecture magnetostratigraphy and incisedvalley systems of the PliocenePleistocene collisional marine foreland basin of Taiwan,Chen W;Ridgway K;Horng C;Chen Y;Shea K;Yeh M,"Lithofacies analysis, magnetostratigraphy, and seismic profiles of Pliocene-Pleistocene foreland basin deposits of Taiwan provide a framework to evaluate the stratigraphic development of a collisional marine foreland basin. We have recognized several scales of stratigraphic packages and unconformities in deposits of the Taiwan foreland basin. Small-scale (20 to 150 m thick) stratigraphic sequences contain upward-shallowing, marine lithofacies successions that are bracketed by thin coquina sandstones. We interpret the small-scale stratigraphic packages as ""parasequences"" in the traditional sequence stratigraphy model, the thin coquina sandstones representing marine-flooding intervals. The average duration of individual small-scale packages was in the range of 37.5 k.y., on the basis of our magnetostratigraphy. These sequences are interpreted as the product of eustatic sealevel change possibly related to the orbital time series of obliquity. Intermediate-scale stratigraphic sequences are 150 to 1000 m thick and are bounded by unconformities that are well exposed in outcrop and can be clearly identified in seismic sections. The unconformity surfaces have several hundred meters of relief and represent periods of major fluvial valley incision in the foreland basin. One of the unconformities is locally an angular one that we interpret as representing a growth structure that formed during structural uplift of the proximal margin of the foreland basin at ca. 1.25 Ma. Across this angular unconformity, there were marked increases in rates of sediment accumulation and tectonic subsidence in the foreland basin. Other major unconformities that bound intermediate-scale stratigraphic sequences are high-relief disconformities. These unconformities may be the product of eustatic changes, because there has been little change in rates of sediment accumulation and tectonic subsidence across these unconformities. The duration of individual, intermediate-scale packages ranges from similar to 100 000 to 700 000 yr, on the basis of magnetostratigraphy and biostratigraphy. We interpret the intermediate-scale sequences as ""sequences"" in the traditional sequence stratigraphy model. Our analysis of the Pliocene-Pleistocene deposits of the Taiwan foreland basin has several implications for understanding the stratigraphic evolution of this collisional marine foreland basin. (1) Deposition in the Taiwan foreland basin appears to have been punctuated by at least five episodes of erosion and major fluvial valley incision. Large volumes of sediment were eroded from the proximal margin of the foreland basin and transported to more distal parts of the foreland basin or to depocenters outside the foreland basin system during all stages of basin development. (2) The presence of high-relief unconformities and growth structures in the Pliocene-Pleistocene foreland basin deposits suggests a well-developed wedge-top depozone in the foreland basin system. (3) The Pliocene-Pleistocene strata of the foreland basin of Taiwan record similar to2.3 m.y. of deposition, on the basis of our magnetostratigraphy. Sediment accumulation rate was on the order of similar to 950 m/m.y. during the earlier stages of basin development. During the later stages of basin development, sediment accumulation rate increased to similar to 1900 m/m.y. Sediment accumulation rates in the collisional marine foreland basin of Taiwan are much higher than previously published rates from more extensively studied retroarc foreland basins and collisional nonmarine foreland basins.","Purdue Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.; Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geol, Taipei 10764, Taiwan.; Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei 115, Taiwan.; Minist Econ Affairs, Cent Geol Survey, Taipei, Taiwan.; Chinese Petr Corp, Taiwan Petr Explorat Div, Miaoli, Taiwan.;",USA;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,USA,USA,6,2.0,1.0,"Ridgway, KD (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",,,foreland basin; magnetostratigraphy; Pliocene-Pleistocene; Taiwan; unconformities,10.1130/0016-7606(2001)113<1249:SAMAIV>2.0.CO;2,Article,DENALI FAULT SYSTEM; SEQUENCE STRATIGRAPHY; WANGANUI BASIN; NEW-ZEALAND; ASTRONOMICAL CALIBRATION; CRETACEOUS MOOSEBAR; EVOLUTION; DEPOSITS; RANGE; CYCLOTHEMS,ASSOC ENGINEERING GEOLOGISTS GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY AMER,GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN,67,113,ISI,PURDUE UNIV;NATL TAIWAN UNIV;INST EARTH SCI,PURDUE UNIV,B2
2006.0,Geol. Soc. Am. Bull.,Geomorphic analysis of the Central Range fault the second major active structure of the Longitudinal Valley suture eastern Taiwan,Shyu J;Sieh K;Chen Y;Chung L,"Numerous landforms along the Longitudinal Valley suture of eastern Taiwan indicate that two opposing reverse faults currently dominate the suturing process between the Luzon volcanic arc and the Central Range of Taiwan. The east-dipping Longitudinal Valley fault, on the eastern flank of the valley, is well known. The west-dipping Central Range reverse fault, on the western flank of the valley, is more obscure. Nonetheless, it has produced many uplifted lateritic fluvial terraces along the eastern flank of the Central Range in the central reach of the valley, from just north of the Wuhe Tableland to near Chihshang. The fault appears to be active but blind south of Chihshang and inactive along the northern part of the Longitudinal Valley. The late Quaternary slip rate of the fault is less than 12.8 mm./yr. This constraint means that the fault is absorbing far less than half of the horizontal shortening across the Longitudinal Valley suture. However, the late Quaternary slip rate along the fault may be comparable to the uplift and exhumation rate of the Central Range. This suggests that localized brittle slip along the Central Range fault is an important component of crustal thickening and uplift of the range, even though additional shortening and crustal thickening may be occurring because of pervasive deformation beneath the range.","CALTECH, Div Geol & Planetary Sci, Tecton Observ, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.; Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei 10764, Taiwan.;",USA;TAIWAN,USA,USA,4,2.0,2.0,"Shyu, JBH (corresponding author), CALTECH, Div Geol & Planetary Sci, Tecton Observ, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",,,Taiwan; tectonic geomorphology; Central Range fault; Longitudinal Valley; sutures; exhumation,10.1130/B25905.1,Article,CHIHSHANG FAULT; MOUNTAIN BELT; EXHUMATION; EVOLUTION; COLLISION; EARTHQUAKES; KINEMATICS; EXTENSION; MODEL; ZONE,"GEOLOGICAL SOC AMER, INC",GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN,47,118,ISI,DIV GEOL AND PLANETARY SCI;NATL TAIWAN UNIV,DIV GEOL AND PLANETARY SCI,B2
2006.0,Geol. Soc. Am. Bull.,Temporal and spatial records of active arccontinent collision in Taiwan A synthesis,Huang C;Yuan P;Tsao S,"Well-documented stratigraphy and clearly defined geodynamics in Taiwan, where some of the best records on arc-continent collision have been preserved, offer a unique example for the study of collision belts worldwide. The oblique arc-continent collision in Taiwan caused a simultaneous and sequential migration of four tectonic processes. Beginning from 16 to 15 Ma, subduction of the South China Sea oceanic crust beneath the Philippine Sea plate resulted in volcanism in the Coastal Range and formation of an accretionary prism in the Central Range. Beginning in the latest Miocene-earliest Pliocene, the subduction was followed by initial arc-continent collision, as supported by the following: unroofing and erosion of the deformed accretionary prism, and deposition of sediments thus derived in the adjacent accretionary forearc (5 Ma) and slope basins (4 Ma); waning of volcanism (north, 6-5 Ma; south, 3.3 Ma); buildup of fringing reefs on the gradually quiescent volcanoes (north, 5.2 Ma; south, 2.9 Ma); arc subsidence by strike-slip faulting and the development of pull-apart intra-arc basins (north, 5.2-3.5 Ma; south, 2.94.8 Ma); thrusting of forearc sequences to generate a collision complex starting from 3 Ma; and clockwise rotation of the arc-forearc sequences (north, 2.1-1.7 Ma; south, 1.4 Ma). The collision propagated southward and reached southern Taiwan by 5 Ma, as evidenced by the successive deformation of the associated accretionary wedge en route. Afterward, the advanced arc-continent collision stage appeared in the earliest Pleistocene, as marked by the westward thrusting and accretion of the Luzon arc-forearc against the accretionary wedge (north, 1.5 Ma; south, 1.1 Ma) and exhumation of the underthrust Eurasian continent rocks (north, 2.0-1.0 Ma; south, 1.0-0.5 Ma). The final stage of the tectonic process, arc collapse-subduction, began by 1 Ma off the northern Coastal Range. The geologic records compiled and presented in this study strongly support the scenario of a continuous southward migration of tectonic processes and a change in sediment source and structural style. Most importantly, the model has a broad potential for reconstructing and predicting the evolution of arc-continent collision through space and time.","Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.; Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Inst Marine Geol & Chem, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan.; MOEA, Cent Geol Survey, Taipei, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,1.0,"Huang, CY (corresponding author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.",,,Taiwan; arc-continent collision; oblique collision; stratigraphic records; collision; suture,10.1130/B25527.1,Article,FORE-ARC; STRUCTURAL EVOLUTION; TECTONIC EVOLUTION; COASTAL RANGE; SUTURE ZONE; LUZON ARC; TIMOR; OROGEN; CONSTRAINTS; BOUNDARY,"GEOLOGICAL SOC AMER, INC",GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN,189,118,ISI,NATL CHENG KUNG UNIV;NATL SUN YAT SEN UNIV,NATL CHENG KUNG UNIV,B1
2008.0,Geol. Soc. Am. Bull.,Evolution of shallow crustal thermal structure from subduction to collision An example from Taiwan,Chi W;Reed D,"We study crustal thermal evolution by examining heat flow patterns along a convergent boundary from a young subduction zone to a more structurally mature collision zone. More than 8000 km of seismic profiles covering an offshore region of 45,000 km(2) in southern Taiwan show widespread bottom-simulating reflectors (BSRs). We derived 1107 BSR-based heat flows before combining 42 additional, published, offshore thermal probe data and 86 on-land heat flow data to document the shallow forearc thermal structures from the subduction zone to the collision zone. In the subduction zone, the geothermal gradient ranges mostly within 30-80 degrees C/km, and decreases toward the arc due to slab cooling, intensive dewatering at the toe, sediment blanketing, topographic effects, and other processes. The geothermal gradient ranges mostly from 30 to 90 degrees C/km in the collision zone, and increases, instead of decreases, toward the arc, possibly caused by exhumation, erosion, topographically induced groundwater circulation, and some upper mantle processes related to collision. Heat flow in the collision zone ranges from 80 to 250 mW/m(2). The high heat flow in the collision zone correlates with a shallower seismicity zone and high seismic attenuation, while the lower heat flow in the subduction zone might allow the earthquakes to rupture to greater depth. The heat flow increases along the topographic high from subduction to collision zone due to increasing geothermal gradients and higher thermal conductivities of the exhumed basement rocks. This heat flow variation may generate an artificial exhumation rate pattern, if a conventional 30 degrees C/km geothermal gradient was used in fission-track studies.","Inst Earth Sci, Sec 2, Taipei, Taiwan.;  San Jose State Univ, Dept Geol, San Jose, CA 95192 USA.;",TAIWAN;USA,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,1.0,"Chi, WC (corresponding author), Inst Earth Sci, Sec 2, Acad Sin 128,Acad Rd, Taipei, Taiwan.",,,bottom-simulating reflector; hydrates; geothermal gradient; heat flow; Taiwan; subduction; collision; seismogenic zone; fission-track dating,10.1130/B26210.1,Article,BOTTOM-SIMULATING-REFLECTORS; SOUTH-CHINA-SEA; OFFSHORE SOUTHWESTERN TAIWAN; GAS-HYDRATE HORIZONS; HEAT-FLOW; ACCRETIONARY PRISMS; METHANE HYDRATE; CONTINENTAL MARGINS; CASCADIA MARGIN; ZONE,"GEOLOGICAL SOC AMER, INC",GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN,48,120,ISI,INST EARTH SCI;SAN JOSE STATE UNIV,INST EARTH SCI,B2
2010.0,Geol. Soc. Am. Bull.,Incision and channel morphology across active structures along the Peikang River central Taiwan Implications for the importance of channel width,Yanites B;Tucker G;Mueller K;Chen Y;Wilcox T;Huang S;Shi K,"River morphology and dynamics are strongly influenced by active tectonics. We report channel dynamics for the Peikang River, which flows through the Hsuehshan Range in central Taiwan. Using a digital elevation model and field surveys, we constrain channel morphology for an similar to 90 km stretch of river to calculate unit stream power and boundary shear stress along the river path. Incision rates are estimated with optically stimulated luminescence dating of sand deposited on strath terraces. We find a strong correlation between unit stream power/shear stress and incision rate, but only if variation in channel width is considered. A calibrated river incision rule implies river incision rates of similar to 9-13.5 mm/yr upstream of the Meiyuan and Tili faults and suggests that one or both of these structures are presently active. Our results indicate that the Shuilikeng fault is also actively deforming, as incision rates increase to similar to 6-10 mm/yr across it, compared to 1-4 mm/yr in adjacent reaches. Prominent narrowing across the Shuilikeng fault, and the absence of significant gradient variation indicate that channel width is a first-order morphological adjustment to differential incision. Only when the channel width-to-depth ratio reaches a minimum does the channel slope significantly adjust to local changes in base level, as is the case upstream of the Meiyuan and Tili faults.","Univ Colorado, Dept Geol Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.;  Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei 106, Taiwan.;",USA;USA;TAIWAN,USA,USA,7,3.0,2.0,"Yanites, BJ (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Geol Sci, 2200 Colorado Ave, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [EAR-0510971]; National Defense Science and Engineering,"Funding was provided by National Science Foundation grant EAR-0510971 and a National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship to Yanites.

1995.0,Geology,ND ISOTOPIC STUDY OF PRECAMBRIAN BASEMENT OF SOUTHKOREA EVIDENCE FOR EARLY ARCHEAN CRUST,LAN C;LEE T;ZHOU X;KWON S,"We carried out a Sm-Nd isotopic reconnaissance study of South Korea. Eight river sediments gave crustal residence ages (T-DM) between 1.7 and 2.7 Ga, implying that, on average, the crust of South Korea was formed in Early to Middle Proterozoic time. Twenty-six Precambrian basement rocks yielded T-DM between 1.4 and 3.8 Ga. More than half of them exceed 2.5 Ga, indicating that South Korea has a long history of crustal evolution. Four of the samples have T-DM from 3.2 to 3.8 Ga suggesting the possibility that there may be ancient continental crust in Korea having ages comparable to those of the oldest cratons in the world. However, these samples also have preferentially higher Sm/Nd, so their old ages could be artifacts, thus requiring confirmation. The large variation in T-DM of South Korea is reminiscent of that for the South China block However, the existence of Early Archean ages better matches that of the North China block, because the basement of south China was thought to be mostly Proterozoic in age. The recent discovery of rare Archean basement rocks in the South China block may favor models that attempt to correlate South Korea with south China.","ACAD SINICA, INST GEOL, BEIJING, PEOPLES R CHINA.; YONSEI UNIV, DEPT GEOL, SEOUL 120749, SOUTH KOREA.;",CHINA;KOREA,CHINA,TAIWAN,4,,,"LAN, CY (corresponding author), ACAD SINICA, INST EARTH SCI, TAIPEI 115, TAIWAN.",,,,10.1130/0091-7613(1995)023<0249:NISOPB>2.3.CO;2,Article,TECTONIC EVOLUTION; CHINA; ROCKS; GEOCHEMISTRY; SYSTEMS; TAIWAN; SR,"GEOLOGICAL SOC AMER, INC",GEOLOGY,70,23,ISI,INST GEOL;YONSEI UNIV,INST EARTH SCI,A

Detachment of the Eurasian slab has created a mantle window for the north-dipping Philippine Sea plate to move in laterally, causing a switch in the subduction polarity.

The surface rupture was more than 90 km long, and vertical displacements ranged from 3 to 8 m. Although pre-existing scarps were identified along the Chelungpu fault, the fault had previously been categorized as a less important active fault, owing to the lack of geochronologic evidence and the failure to recognize fault-related geomorphic features. Identifying geomorphic features at active faults in Taiwan will permit the delineation of future surface ruptures and the determination of past magnitudes of past earthquakes, thus contributing to hazard assessment.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei 106, Taiwan.; Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,6,1.0,1.0,"Chen, YG (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, 245 Choushan Rd, Taipei 106, Taiwan.",,,earthquake; rupture; faults; fault scarps; terraces,10.1130/0091-7613(2002)030<0171:GEFPEL>2.0.CO;2,Article,FAULT,"GEOLOGICAL SOC AMERICA, INC",GEOLOGY,33,30,ISI,NATL TAIWAN UNIV;INST EARTH SCI,NATL TAIWAN UNIV,B2

We present 20 new apatite fission-track ages and 6 new zircon fission-track ages. Apatite and zircon ages are all reset in the northern and eastern parts of Taiwan, although the region of reset apatite ages is larger. We interpret this pattern as resulting from crustal accretion at the western margin of the orogenic wedge combined with southward propagation of the collision zone. A one-dimensional thermal model including erosion provides prediction of the fission-track ages. The distribution of reset ages is best explained with an erosion rate of 4-6 mm/yr. Given a propagation velocity of 60 mm/yr, this erosion rate implies that nearly 25 km of material has been eroded from northern Taiwan.

2007.0,Geology,Absolute fault and crustal strength from wedge tapers,Suppe J,"The strengths of mountain belts and major faults have been notoriously difficult to constrain and there is ongoing debate over the controlling mechanisms and stress magnitudes. Here we show that the strengths of active thrust-belt wedges and their basal detachments can be directly determined from the covariation of surface slope (x with detachment dip 0, without strong assumptions about the specific strength-controlling mechanisms. Even a single taper measurement (alpha, beta) can strongly constrain the set of possible wedge and detachment strengths. This theory is tested with dry sand wedges and then applied to the Niger delta thrust belt, the active Taiwan mountain belt, and the thrust that slipped in the M = 7.6 Chi-Chi earthquake. Their basal detachments are shown to be exceedingly weak, with effective coefficients of friction (0.04-0.1) that are an order of magnitude less than most laboratory friction coefficients (0.6-0.85). In contrast, these wedges are moderately strong internally, within the range of pressure-dependent strengths in deep boreholes. These results confirm the existence of exceedingly weak faults and strong crust, which raises important causal questions.","Princeton Univ, Dept Geosci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei 106, Taiwan.;",USA;TAIWAN,USA,USA,1,2.0,0.0,"Suppe, J (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Dept Geosci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",,,fault strength; wedge mechanics; fold-and-thrust belt; Niger delta; Taiwan; Chi-Chi earthquake,10.1130/G24053A.1,Article,SAN-ANDREAS FAULT; FLUID PRESSURE; THRUST BELTS; HEAT-FLOW; STRESS; MECHANICS; RESISTANCE; STATE; SLIP,"GEOLOGICAL SOC AMER, INC",GEOLOGY,143,35,ISI,PRINCETON UNIV;NATL TAIWAN UNIV,PRINCETON UNIV,C

In Taiwan, continental crust within the collision is accreted in the prowedge facing Asia, but is advected eastward into the east-verging retrowedge, where the most deeply exhumed rocks are exposed. Wedge mechanics predict a reversal in the direction of plunge of the principal compressive stress at the topographic divide between the opposing wedges. The observation of a single cleavage in western Taiwan suggests that the cleavage in the prowedge remains stable with respect to the stress orientation. In contrast, the existence of a second crenulation cleavage in the retrowedge is evidence for an abrupt change in stress orientation and unstable buckling of preexisting prowedge fabrics. Advection of a fabric across a topographic divide in a doubly vergent wedge provides an explanation for the occurrence of cleavage fronts and fans in natural systems such as Taiwan.","Penn State Univ, Dept Geosci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.; Univ Washington, Dept Earth & Space Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.; Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.; ExxonMobil Explorat Co, Houston, TX 77210 USA.;",USA;USA;TAIWAN;USA,USA,USA,4,3.0,2.0,"Fisher, DM (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Geosci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",,,cleavage fan; cleavage front; Taiwan; slaty cleavage; incremental strain,10.1130/G22850A.1,Article,EROSION; STRAIN; EXAMPLE; SLATES; BELT,"GEOLOGICAL SOC AMER, INC",GEOLOGY,28,35,ISI,PENN STATE UNIV;UNIV WASHINGTON;NATL TAIWAN UNIV,PENN STATE UNIV,B1

2009.0,Geology,Constantslope alluvial fans and source basins in Taiwan,Lin Z;Oguchi T;Chen Y;Saito K,"We examined morphometric properties of alluvial fans and their source basins in Taiwan. Although studies elsewhere have found a decrease in alluvial-fan slope and basin slope with increasing basin area, the relatively large fans and source basins along the backbone of the Taiwan Central Range tend to have constant mean slopes of approximately 0.9 degrees and 32 degrees, respectively, with basin areas varying over the range 80-2900 km(2). Smaller fans and source basins, mostly in lower areas away from the backbone of the range, have more varied slopes. The existence of the constant-slope fans and basins may reflect highly organized hillslope-channel systems that have formed under very rapid uplift and erosion. The systems are dominated by steep V-shaped valleys with similar hillslope angles and consistently high-gradient channels that enable efficient sediment flushing. This leads to similar ratios of sediment discharge to runoff and similar sediment grain sizes irrespective of basin area, resulting in alluvial fans with similar slopes.","Univ Tokyo, Ctr Spatial Informat Sci, Chiba 2778568, Japan.;  Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Act Fault Res Ctr, Tsukuba 3058567, Japan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei 106, Taiwan.;  Saitama Univ, Fac Educ, Saitama 3388570, Japan.;",JAPAN;JAPAN;TAIWAN;JAPAN,JAPAN,JAPAN,4,3.0,2.0,"Lin, Z (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Ctr Spatial Informat Sci, Chiba 2778568, Japan.","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) FellowshipMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science","We thank Ian Evans, Adrian Harvey, Tina Niemi, and Robert Wasson for their constructive review comments, and Jui-Chin Chang, Hongey Chen, Jiun-Chuan Lin, and Richard Walker for their helpful support.

Numerous tectonic models have been proposed for this orogen, and include both thin-skinned and thick-skinned lithospheric deformation. These models predict very different structures at middle and lower crustal depths, but insufficient geophysical data exist to unequivocally distinguish between them. Long-period magnetotelluric (MT) data were collected in central Taiwan in 2006-2007 to constrain the crustal resistivity structure. A two-dimensional inversion of these MT data revealed a prominent electrical conductor that extends across the decollement predicted by the thin-skinned model. This feature is interpreted to be due to 1%-2% saline fluids, and is inconsistent with the thin-skinned model. In contrast, the thick-skinned model predicts this feature since fluids are generated in the crustal root through metamorphism. Quantitative correlation of the resistivity and seismic velocity models supports small-volume, high-salinity fluids in a thickened crust as the cause of this conductor.","Univ Alberta, Dept Phys, Edmonton, AB T6G 2R3, Canada.;  Natl Cent Univ, Inst Geophys, Chungli 32054, Taiwan.;  SUNY Binghamton, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA.;  Inst Geol & Nucl Sci, Lower Hutt 5010, New Zealand.;",CANADA;TAIWAN;USA;NEW ZEALAND,CANADA,CANADA,9,2.0,1.0,"Bertrand, E (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Phys, Edmonton, AB T6G 2R3, Canada.","National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [EAR0410227]; Alberta Ingenuity Fund; National Central University of Taiwan; University of Alberta, CanadaUniversity of Alberta","This research was funded by the National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, National Science Foundation (Continental Dynamics Program) under award EAR0410227, Alberta Ingenuity Fund, National Central University of Taiwan, and the University of Alberta, Canada.

2010.0,Geology,How rivers react to large earthquakes Evidence from central Taiwan,Yanites B;Tucker G;Mueller K;Chen Y,"Earthquakes and bedrock river incision are fundamental processes in the evolution of tectonically active landscapes, yet little work has focused on understanding how a bedrock river responds to a single large earthquake. Data from the 1999 M-w = 7.6 Chi-Chi earthquake in central Taiwan show dramatic differences in river response that depend on the proximity to the rupture zone. Near the fault scarp, vertical ground deformation intensifies river incision on a time scale of years to decades, while distal to the fault, landslides induced by the earthquake mantle bedrock on the river bed with sediment, impeding incision for decades to centuries as the material is evacuated. This surprising spatial and temporal variability in bedrock incision caused by earthquakes has implications for the paleoseismic interpretation of bedrock terraces and for the evolution of tectonically active landscapes.","Univ Colorado, Dept Geol Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.;  Univ Colorado, CIRES, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei 10764, Taiwan.;",USA;USA;TAIWAN,USA,USA,4,3.0,2.0,"Yanites, BJ (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Geol Sci, 1006 CC Little Bldg, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [EAR-0510971]; National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship,"Funding was provided by National Science Foundation grant EAR-0510971 and a National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship to Yanites.

2011.0,Geology,Efficient transport of fossil organic carbon to the ocean by steep mountain rivers An orogenic carbon sequestration mechanism,Hilton R;Galy A;Hovius N;Horng M;Chen H,"Mountain building exposes fossil organic carbon (OCfossil) in exhumed sedimentary rocks. Oxidation of this material releases carbon dioxide from long-term geological storage to the atmosphere. OCfossil is mobilized on hillslopes by mass wasting and transferred to the particulate load of rivers. In large fluvial systems, it is thought to be oxidised in transit, but in short, steep rivers that drain mountain islands, OCfossil may escape oxidation and re-enter geological storage due to rapid fluvial transfer to the ocean. In these settings, the rates of OCfossil transfer and their controls remain poorly constrained. Here we quantify the erosion of OCfossil from the Taiwan mountain belt, combining discharge statistics with measurements of particulate organic carbon load and source in 11 rivers. Annual OCfossil yields in Taiwan vary from 12 +/- 1 to 246 +/- 22 tC km(-2) yr(-1), controlled by the high physical erosion rates that accompany rapid crustal shortening and frequent typhoon impacts. Efficient transfer of this material ensures that 1.3 +/- 0.1 x 10(6) tC yr(-1) of OCfossil exhumed in Taiwan is delivered to the ocean, with <15% loss due to weathering in transit. Our findings suggest that erosion of coastal mountain ranges can force efficient transfer and long-term re-accumulation of OCfossil in marine sediments, further enhancing the role of mountain building in the long-term storage of carbon in the lithosphere.","Inst Phys Globe, Lab Geochim Cosmochim, F-75252 Paris 05, France.;  Univ Durham, Dept Geog, Durham DH1 3LE, England.;  Univ Cambridge, Dept Earth Sci, Cambridge CB2 3EQ, England.;  Minist Econ Affairs, Water Resources Agcy, Taipei 10651, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.;",FRANCE;UNITED KINGDOM;UNITED KINGDOM;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,FRANCE,FRANCE,5,4.0,0.0,"Hilton, RG (corresponding author), Inst Phys Globe, Lab Geochim Cosmochim, 4 Pl Jussieu, F-75252 Paris 05, France.","Cambridge Trusts, National Taiwan UniversityNational Taiwan University; NERCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/E003192/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/E003192/1] Funding Source: researchfish","This work was supported by The Cambridge Trusts, National Taiwan University.

2012.0,Geology,An earthquake slip zone is a magnetic recorder,Chou Y;Song S;Aubourg C;Lee T;Boullier A;Song Y;Yeh E;Kuo L;Wang C,"During an earthquake, the physical and the chemical transformations along a slip zone lead to an intense deformation within the gouge layer of a mature fault zone. Because the gouge contains ferromagnetic minerals, it has the capacity to behave as a magnetic recorder during an earthquake. This constitutes a conceivable way to identify earthquake slip zones. In this paper, we investigate the magnetic record of the Chelungpu fault gouge that hosts the principal slip zone of the Chi-Chi earthquake (M-w 7.6, 1999, Taiwan) using Taiwan Chelungpu-fault Drilling Project core samples. Rock magnetic investigation pinpoints the location of the Chi-Chi millimeter-thick principal slip zone within the 16 cm thick gouge at 1 km depth. A modern magnetic dipole of Earth's magnetic field is recovered throughout this gouge, but not in the wall rocks nor in the two other adjacent fault zones. This magnetic record resides essentially in two magnetic minerals: magnetite in the principal slip zone, and neoformed goethite elsewhere in the gouge. We propose a model where the magnetic record (1) is preserved during inter-seismic time, (2) is erased during co-seismic time, and (3) is imprinted during post-seismic time when fluids cooled down. We suggest that the identification of a stable magnetic record carried by neoformed goethite may be a signature of a frictional heating process in a seismic slip zone.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.;  Univ Cergy Pontoise, F-95031 Neuville Sur Oise, Cergy Pontoise, France.;  CNRS NSC, Int Lab LIA ADEPT, France Taiwan, France.;  Univ Pau, CNRS, UMR 5150, Lab Fluides Complexes & Reservoirs, F-64013 Pau, France.;  Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei 115, Taiwan.;  Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, ISTerre, F-38041 Grenoble 9, France.;  Natl Synchrotron Radiat Res Ctr, Hsinchu 30076, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Taipei 11677, Taiwan.;  Natl Cent Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Jhongli 32001, Taoyuan, Taiwan.;  Natl Cent Univ, Inst Geophys, Jhongli 32001, Taoyuan, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;FRANCE;FRANCE;FRANCE;TAIWAN;FRANCE;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,9,1.0,2.0,"Chou, YM (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, 1 Roosevelt Rd,Sect 4, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.",NSRRC; French Ministere des Affaires Etrangeres,"We would like to express our gratitude to the working group of the Taiwan Chelungpu-fault Drilling Project.

2013.0,Geology,Altered regional sediment transport regime after a large typhoon southern Taiwan,Huang M;Montgomery D,"Analyses of river suspended sediment response to record-breaking regional rainfall in southern Taiwan during typhoon Morakot, 7-9 August 2009, reveal systematic changes in the regional sediment transport regime as characterized by rating curve parameters, with decreasing b (typically considered to be a constant for a given gauging station) and increasing intercept K values in concentration-discharge (C-Q) relations (C = KQ(b)). These changes result in much greater sediment concentration, and thus sediment transport, in subsequent low-flow events after the typhoon, an effect that amplifies and extends the influence of such extreme events through increased low-flow sediment transport. Our finding that the exponent b is not constant contrasts with the conventional assumption that large events influence sediment yields through increased intercept (K) values, thereby supporting the interpretation that basin sediment delivery influences both rating parameters, and increases post-event low-flow sediment transport. Surveys of landslide density and riverbed grain sizes before and after typhoon Morakot support the interpretation that the observed decrease in b values and the synchronous shift from an inverse correlation between K and mean catchment slope before the typhoon to a positive correlation afterward reflect an altered sediment transport regime and a change from channel migration and bank erosion to reworking of landslide debris and enhanced bed mobility as the dominant processes supplying fluvial sediment.","Acad Sinica, Res Ctr Environm Changes, Taipei 115, Taiwan.;  Univ Washington, Dept Earth & Space Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.;",TAIWAN;USA,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,0.0,"Huang, MYF (corresponding author), Acad Sinica, Res Ctr Environm Changes, Taipei 115, Taiwan.",,,,10.1130/G34826.1,Article,FLUVIAL SEDIMENT; DISCHARGE; CALIFORNIA; FREQUENCY; MORAKOT; RIVERS; OCEAN; BASIN,"GEOLOGICAL SOC AMER, INC",GEOLOGY,16,41,ISI,ACAD SINICA;UNIV WASHINGTON,ACAD SINICA,B2

Furthermore, crustal-scale tomographic velocity models show that this crust is underthrusted to similar to 15 km depth below the accretionary prism, where it then is structurally underplated to the base of the prism. We document an increasing volume of accreted crust from south to north, and in our northern transect high-velocity material of the accretionary prism can be directly linked to outcrops of Central Range basement rocks. In map view the Central Range of Taiwan is clearly contiguous with the Hengchun Peninsula and Hengchun submarine ridge to the south. Accordingly, we propose a new model in which the Central Range forms directly from the accretionary prism, including the basement core, which originates from subducted, and then accreted, extended to hyper-extended continental crust.","Univ Texas Austin R2200, Inst Geophys, Austin, TX 78758 USA.;  SUNY Binghamton, Dept Geol Sci, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, Taipei 106, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Dept Geophys, Keelung 20224, Taiwan.;",USA;USA;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,USA,USA,8,3.0,1.0,"McIntosh, K (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin R2200, Inst Geophys, 10100 Burnet Rd, Austin, TX 78758 USA.","U.S. National Science Foundation Continental Dynamics Program; Taiwan's National Science Council, Ministry of Interior; Central Geological Survey","We are grateful to C.Y.

2014.0,Geology,Basin inversion in central Taiwan and its importance for seismic hazard,Camanni G;Chen C;Brown D;Alvarez-Marron J;Wu Y;Chen H;Huang H;Chu H;Chen M;Chang C,"On 27 March 2013, a 6.2 M-L earthquake occurred at 19 km depth in eastern Nantou, central Taiwan. Over a 2 week period it was followed by more than 680 aftershocks that ranged to 5 M-L. Most events occurred below the similar to 10-km-deep detachment fault predicted for this part of the mountain belt, coinciding with other precisely located hypocenters that indicate that much of the crust in this area is seismically active. We combine geological data with a three-dimensional (3-D) P-wave velocity model derived from local tomography and earthquake hypocenters to determine a model for the structure of central Taiwan. Much of the surface geology of the area comprises the uplifted Eocene rocks of the Hsuehshan Basin. The 3-D P-wave velocity model shows a shallowing of higher velocities across the Hsuehshan Basin and hypocenter data indicate that its western bounding fault is clearly defined by an eastward-dipping band of events that extends to >20 km depth. The eastern bounding fault is interpreted to coincide at depth with a cluster of events between 20 and 30 km depth. These data suggest that the preexisting, rift-related extensional faults of the Hsuehshan Basin are currently being reactivated and the basin is being inverted. We present hypocenter data from the Nantou sequence that corroborate this interpretation and show the importance of choosing the correct structural model when assessing seismic risk.","ICTJA CSIC, Inst Earth Sci Jaume Almera, Barcelona 08028, Spain.;  Cent Geol Survey, Taipei 235, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei 106, Taiwan.;  Cent Weather Bur, Taipei 10048, Taiwan.;",SPAIN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,SPAIN,SPAIN,10,2.0,2.0,"Camanni, G (corresponding author), ICTJA CSIC, Inst Earth Sci Jaume Almera, Lluis Sole & Sabaris S-N, Barcelona 08028, Spain.",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC) [2006 301010]; Ministerio de Ciencia e InnovacionInstituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish GovernmentEuropean Commission [CGL2009-11843-BTE]; CSIC,"Discussions with Emilio Casciello, Andrea Festa, and Andres Perez-Estaun on the structural architecture of orogens helped to clarify our ideas.

Reevaluation of the age of collision from orogenic thermal evolution requires distinguishing the onset of submarine continental accretion from earlier oceanic subduction and subsequent subaerial orogenic evolution. We present new thermo-chronological constraints from the first age-elevation relationship transect in Taiwan and zircon and apatite fission-track ages from sediments in the western foreland. Our data reveal the onset of cooling from at least 7.1 +/- 1.3 Ma, at a minimum rate of 21 degrees C/m.y., in the submarine sedimentary wedge followed by a marked acceleration of subaerial exhumation after ca. 3.2 +/- 0.6 Ma at an average rate of 1.7 km/m.y.

2014.0,Geology,Seasonal longterm and shortterm deformation in the Central Range of Taiwan induced by landslides,Hsu Y;Chen R;Lin C;Chen H;Yu S,"Seasonal movement of GPS stations is often attributed to hydrological loading and other environmental factors. For the first time we observe seasonal motion associated with slow-moving landslides. Eight of 26 continuous GPS (cGPS) sites in the Central Range of Taiwan show long-term landslide-induced motion at rates of similar to 3-15 mm/yr, similar to 20%-60% of their tectonic interseismic velocities. The directions of movements after heavy rains and in the wet season are consistent with the slope directions derived from a high-resolution elevation model constructed by airborne lidar. Long-term and seasonal interseismic motions are modulated by slow-moving landslides. Seasonal motions of landslides at Lushan show peak to peak amplitudes of similar to 3-19 mm. Estimates of interseismic crustal strain can be biased if surface processes are not taken into account. Preliminary analyses indicate that rainfall and topography play strong roles in the occurrence of landslides. Discrimination between surface processes and motion that has a tectonic origin is the key to natural hazard assessments.","Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei 115, Taiwan.;  Chinese Culture Univ, Dept Geol, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,5,1.0,1.0,"Hsu, YJ (corresponding author), Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei 115, Taiwan.","National Science Council of the Republic of ChinaMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [NSC 101-2116-M-001-026-MY3]","We thank the editor, James Spotila, and three reviewers (Roland Burgmann, Kosuke Heki, and Jeff Freymueller) for their constructive suggestions.

2015.0,Geology,Imaging highpressure rock exhumation in eastern Taiwan,Brown D;Wu Y;Feng K;Chao W;Huang H,"Increasingly detailed studies of out crops of high-pressure rock terranes in combination with rapidly evolving numerical modeling studies have given rise to a number of possible explanations for the processes by which these rocks are exhumed. Imaging actively exhuming high-pressure terranes remains one of the fundamental, but elusive, tasks that could advance the understanding of how these important rocks reach Earth's surface. Seismic tomography along the active arc-continent collision in eastern Taiwan images a high P- and S-wave velocity zone that extends from the shallow subsurface beneath a high-pressure metamorphic terrane to similar to 50 km depth. We present a petrophysical analysis of this high-velocity zone that indicates the presence of rock types common to high-pressure terranes. The high-velocity zone is seismically active throughout. We determine focal mechanisms for 57 earthquakes, and carry out full waveform modeling on 10; these have double-couple focal mechanisms with a compensated linear vector dipole component up to 20.6%. We suggest that the high-velocity zone comprises an exhuming high-pressure terrane. Focal mechanisms for earthquakes within it indicate that shear faulting dominates in the deformation, but high fluid pressure may also play a role.","CSIC, Inst Earth Sci Jaume Almera, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei 106, Taiwan.;  Univ Utah, Dept Geol & Geophys, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.;  CALTECH, Dept Geol & Planetary Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.;",SPAIN;TAIWAN;USA;USA,SPAIN,SPAIN,5,2.0,1.0,"Brown, D (corresponding author), CSIC, Inst Earth Sci Jaume Almera, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain.",MICINNSpanish GovernmentEuropean Commission [CGL2013-43877-P]; MOST [103-2811-M-002-053],"Funding was provided by MICINN grant CGL2013-43877-P and MOST grant 103-2811-M-002-053.

2015.0,Geology,Old continental zircons from a young oceanic arc eastern Taiwan Implications for Luzon subduction initiation and Asian accretionary orogeny,Shao W;Chung S;Chen W;Lee H;Xie L,"Accretionary orogeny that involves terrain accretion and subsequent reprocessing plays a crucial role in the Phanerozoic tectonics and continental growth of Asia. This study reports zircon U-Pb and Hf isotope data from the Chimei igneous complex, eastern Taiwan, part of the intra-oceanic Luzon arc that has accreted onto the Eurasian continental margin since ca. 5 Ma. Among 292 U-Pb dates and 267 Hf isotope ratios obtained for zircon separates from six andesites, ten grains of magmatic zircons gave a mean Pb-206/U-238 age at 9.0 +/- 0.3 Ma, with epsilon(Hf(t)) values from +20 to +12, which we interpret as the emplacement age of the Chimei complex. Remaining zircons, however, show inherited ages clustering at ca. 14 Ma (n = 9) and ca. 220 Ma (n = 56, the largest peak), along with much older ages of ca. 0.7 Ga, 1.9 Ga, and 2.5 Ga. Whereas the ca. 14 Ma zircons may have crystallized from the earliest magmatism of the northern Luzon arc, the Indosinian and older zircons suggest Cathaysia-type sources that we attribute to a continental fragment that split off from the Eurasian margin by opening of the South China Sea and then drifted and accreted to the western Philippine Sea plate before the Luzon subduction initiation. Consequently, magmas derived from the depleted mantle wedge evolved and picked up the continental zircons during ascent. Our study not only better integrates regional tectonics with magmatic records in Southeast Asia, but also signifies a modern example from Taiwan that highlights the importance of ribbon continents in Asian orogenesis over time and space.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.;  Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei 11529, Taiwan.;  Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geol & Geophys, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;CHINA,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,5,1.0,1.0,"Shao, WY (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.","National Taiwan UniversityNational Taiwan University; Ministry of Science and Technology, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan; MOSTMinistry of Science and Technology (MOST) Korea [103-2745-M-002-005-ASP]","Shao thanks the Ph.D. student fellowships from National Taiwan University and Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.

We combine 62 new zircon fission-track ages with timing of rapid subsidence in the foreland basin to identify the timing of the onset of exhumation and orogenesis. The oldest completely reset zircon fission-track ages and the onset of rapid tectonic subsidence in both the northern and southern parts of the foreland basin are ca. 5-6 Ma. We propose that north-south rifting in the South China Sea created a north-trending continental margin before the collision rather than the commonly assumed northeast-trending margin. Consequently, both this north-trending continental margin and the Luzon arc of the Philippine Sea plate were subparallel, resulting in an initial collision that was simultaneous along strike.","Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Chiayi 603, Taiwan, Taiwan.;  Univ Connecticut, Ctr Integrat Geosci, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.;  Natl Taipei Univ Technol, Dept Mat & Mineral Resources Engn, Taipei 106, Taiwan, Taiwan.;  Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Tainan 701, Taiwan, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;USA;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,6,1.0,1.0,"Lee, YH (corresponding author), Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Chiayi 603, Taiwan, Taiwan.","U.S. National Science Foundation (Tectonics Program) [EAR-1220453, EAR-0711353]; U.S. National Science Foundation (Office of International Science and Engineering)National Science Foundation (NSF) [EAR-1220453, EAR-0711353]; Taiwan National Science CouncilMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [NSC 102-2116-M-194-007]","We thank Jonny Wu and John Suppe and many other colleagues in Taiwan for many stimulating discussions.

These linear structures typically form through friction between two solids. Here we describe brushlines, a new class of fault striation in pseudotachylytes, formed during coseismic slip at the interface between host rock and frictional melt. Unlike slickensides, brushlines primarily lack longitudinal step-like asymmetry and display a hemicylindrical morphology. This new class of striation forms while the frictional melt has sufficiently low viscosity to be brushed along the direction of coseismic displacement by small asperities on the host-rock block. In the Hoping River pseudotachylytes of eastern Taiwan, the long axis of brushlines is parallel to the earthquake slip direction determined using the offset of piercing points across the fault.

The difference between the maximum and minimum temperatures estimated by a Raman CM geothermometer reaches 200 degrees C, which is much wider than those in other metamorphic belts and contact aureoles. In light of these results, we considered two possible explanations: (1) a mixture of detrital and metamorphic graphite grains, and (2) a mixture of different reactive CM during short-lived metamorphism. One sample shows a near-bimodal peak, suggesting the former hypothesis, while the other two samples show a continuous single peak, suggesting the latter possibility. Detailed analyses of CM crystallinities have the potential to extract information relating not only to the peak metamorphic temperature, but also to the pre-metamorphic history or the duration of heating in a metamorphic belt.","Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Nagoya, Aichi 4648602, Japan.;  Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Studies, Hualien 97401, Taiwan.;  Nagoya Univ, Inst Space Earth Environm Res, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan.;",JAPAN;TAIWAN;JAPAN,JAPAN,JAPAN,3,2.0,1.0,"Kouketsu, Y (corresponding author), Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Nagoya, Aichi 4648602, Japan.","Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [16K17820]; Institute for Space-Earth Environmental Research, Nagoya University, Japan; Ministry of Science and Technology (Taiwan)Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [1062116M259004]","We deeply appreciate the constructive comments by W.

2021.0,Geology,Geochemical evidence of tropical cyclone controls on shallowmarine sedimentation Pliocene Taiwan,Dashtgard S;Lowemark L;Wang P;Setiaji R;Vaucher R,"Shallow-marine sediment typically contains a mix of marine and terrestrial organic material (OM). Most terrestrial OM enters the ocean through rivers, and marine OM is incorporated into the sediment through both suspension settling of marine plankton and sediment reworking by tides and waves under fair-weather conditions. River-derived terrestrial OM is delivered year-round, although sediment and OM delivery from rivers is typically highest during extreme weather events that impact river catchments. In Taiwan, tropical cyclones (TCs) are the dominant extreme weather event, and 75% of all sediment delivered to the surrounding ocean occurs during TCs. Distinguishing between sediment deposited during TCs and that redistributed by tides and waves during fair-weather conditions can be approximated using ?13Corg values and C:N ratios of OM. Lower Pliocene shallow-marine sedimentary strata in the Western Foreland Basin of Taiwan rarely exhibit physical evidence of stormdominated deposition. Instead they comprise completely bioturbated intervals that transition upward into strata dominated by tidally generated sedimentary structures, indicating extensive sediment reworking under fair-weather conditions. However, these strata contain OM that is effectively 100% terrestrial OM in sediment that accumulated in estimated water depths <35 m. The overwhelming contribution of terrestrially sourced OM is attributed to the dominance of TCs on sedimentation, whereby ?600,000 TCs are estimated to have impacted Taiwan during accumulation of the succession. In contrast, the virtual absence of marine OM indicates that organic contributions from suspension settling of marine OM is negligible regardless of the preserved evidence of extensive reworking under fair-weather conditions. These data suggest that (1) even in the absence of physical expressions of storm deposition, TCs still completely dominate sedimentation in shallow-marine environments, and (2) the organic geochemical signal of preserved shallow-marine strata is not reflective of day-to-day depositional conditions in the environment.","Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Appl Res Ichnol & Sedimentol ARISE Grp, Columbia, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, POB 13-318, Taipei 106, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, POB 13-318, Taipei 106, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Res Ctr Future Earth, POB 13-318, Taipei 106, Taiwan.;",CANADA;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,CANADA,TAIWAN,5,2.0,1.0,"Lowemark, L (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, POB 13-318, Taipei 106, Taiwan.","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery GrantNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [RGPIN-2019-04528]; Ministry of Science and Technology (Taiwan)Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 107-2116-M-002011]; Ministry of Science and Technology; Higher Education Sprout Project (Ministry of Education of Taiwan)",This research was funded through a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery Grant to Dashtgard (grant RGPIN-2019-04528) and a Ministry of Science and Technology (Taiwan) grant to Lowemark (grant MOST 107-2116-M-002011).

2021.0,Geopersia,The Sedimentological Record of Upper Holocene Tsunami Event in Fengbin Taiwan,Laksono F;Tsai L;Pilarczyk J,"A tsunami had struck the Ami tribe's settlement on the eastern coast of Taiwan in 1771. The trigger of this tsunami is still debatable. Hence, the analysis of tsunami deposits in Fengbin is needed to understand the chronology of the tsunami. There are three types of sediment samples taken from the study area, namely modern beach sand, modern fluvial sand, and sediment materials from the marine terrace. Sample analysis was carried out using the point counting, granulometry, biozonation, and paleobathymetry methods to determine the facies, provenance, and sediment transport mechanisms. The results of field observation indicate the presence of marine shells on the sediment deposit of marine terraces at elevations between 10.5-12.5 m. The thickness of this deposit is between 15-20 cm in the fining upward succession and there is a rip-up clast sedimentary structure. The characteristic of this deposit is similar to tsunami deposits found on the Ishigaki and Miyako Islands, Japan. The conclusion of this study is that there is a tsunami deposit in Fengbin associated with the tsunami deposits found in Miyako and Ishigaki Islands, Japan. The trigger of the tsunami in Fengbin probably attributed to tectonic activity in the Ryukyu Trench.","Jenderal Soedirman Univ, Dept Geol Engn, Kalimanah, Purbalingga, Indonesia.;  Natl Cent Univ, Grad Inst Appl Geol, Taoyuan, Taiwan.;  Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Burnaby, BC, Canada.;",INDONESIA;TAIWAN;CANADA,INDONESIA,INDONESIA,3,2.0,0.0,"Laksono, FAT (corresponding author), Jenderal Soedirman Univ, Dept Geol Engn, Kalimanah, Purbalingga, Indonesia.",,,Paleo-Tsunami; Upper Holocene; Marine Terrace; Sedimentological Record; Fengbin,10.22059/GEOPE.2020.301603.648548,Article,ARC-CONTINENT COLLISION; HUA-TUNG COAST; TECTONIC SIGNIFICANCE; MARINE TERRACES; FAN-DELTA; DEPOSITS; UPLIFT; RANGE; SEA; VARIABILITY,UNIV TEHRAN,GEOPERSIA,0,11,ISI,JENDERAL SOEDIRMAN UNIV;NATL CENT UNIV;SIMON FRASER UNIV,JENDERAL SOEDIRMAN UNIV,B2
2010.0,Georisk,Estimating spatial correlation structures based on CPT data,Liu C;Chen C,"Spatial correlation structures are usually used while modelling inherent uncertainty associated with soil properties. To retrieve this information a sufficient number of measurements and equal intervals between measurements or samples are always required. However, in practice, it is not usual to conduct site investigation in that way subject to a limited budget. Therefore, it is of interest to understand the possible bias created by using samples with unequal intervals. This research focuses on estimating the vertical spatial correlation structures of cone penetration tests (CPT) data conducted at a liquefaction site in Taiwan. The appropriate fitting range used in calibrating the correlation model is also discussed. The results show that cone tip resistance has larger correlation distances than that of sleeve friction. The estimated correlation distances of the CPT profiles are similar while using an equal sampling interval within a certain fitting range (denoted as the critical interval of measurements in this research). The results indicate that the effect of using different curve-fitting ranges is relatively insignificant for correlation distances of sleeve friction, whereas the correlation distances of cone tip resistance are more sensitive to different curve-fitting ranges. Moreover, the mean values of correlation distances are more constant for the equal sampling interval cases than for the unequal interval cases. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Civil Engineering Department, National Chi Nan University, Nantou, 545, Taiwan",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,0.0,"Liu, C.-N.; Civil Engineering Department, , Nantou, 545, Taiwan; 電子郵件: cnliu@ncnu.edu.tw",,NA NA NA,CPT;  Field test;  Random field;  Spatial correlation structure,10.1080/17499511003630504,Article,cone penetration test;  estimation method;  modeling;  soil mechanics;  soil property;  soil test;  spatial analysis; Taiwan,,Georisk,13,4,scopus,NATIONAL CHI NAN UNIVERSITY,NOTREPORTED,B2

Results have shown that for Chiuliao 1st Levee, the slope sliding failure has a higher coefficient of variation (COV). For Gueishan Levee, retaining wall sliding and overturning failure have higher values of COV instead.

,Georisk,Earthquakeinduced unserviceable apartment rate and earthquake insurance in Taiwan,Wu M;Wang J;Chen J;Chen I,"In this paper, we aimed to estimate the earthquake-induced, annual unserviceable apartment rate (AUAR) for each township in Taiwan and note that the AUAR does not account for the number of unserviceable apartments caused by earlier major earthquakes in previous years. The key sources of information used in this study include the 37 active faults and their respective activity (e.g. maximum earthquake and return period), along with empirical relationships that can predict unserviceable apartment rate (UAR) and peak ground velocity. The result shows that the nationwide (average) AUAR among the 349 townships of Taiwan should be equal to 0.00081. The second part of the study is to review the current earthquake insurance in Taiwan. Based on the insurance premium and insurance claim, the corresponding AUAR derived with the insurance data is equal to 0.00077, which is fairly close to that (0.00081) from this study. In other words, this study is somehow supported by the data of the earthquake insurance in Taiwan or this study validates the rationale of the current insurance policy that is well reflecting the earthquake potentials and apartment vulnerability in Taiwan.","Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.;  Natl Cent Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Taoyuan 32001, Taiwan.;  Natl Cent Univ, Res Ctr Hazard Mitigat & Prevent, Taoyuan 32001, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,4,1.0,,"Wang, JP (corresponding author), Natl Cent Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Taoyuan 32001, Taiwan.; Wang, JP (corresponding author), Natl Cent Univ, Res Ctr Hazard Mitigat & Prevent, Taoyuan 32001, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and Technology of TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST108-2221-E-008-041-MY3]",This study was fundedby the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan [grant number MOST108-2221-E-008-041-MY3].,Earthquake; annual unserviceable apartment rate; insurance; Taiwan,10.1080/17499518.2021.1971253,Article; Early Access,SEISMIC HAZARD ANALYSIS; STRUCTURE SOURCE DATABASE; PEAK GROUND ACCELERATION; MODEL TEM PROJECT; ATTENUATION RELATIONSHIPS; CRUSTAL EARTHQUAKES; VELOCITY; SYSTEM,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,GEORISK-ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF RISK FOR ENGINEERED SYSTEMS AND GEOHAZARDS,0,,ISI,NATL UNIV KAOHSIUNG;NATL CENT UNIV;NATL CENT UNIV,NATL CENT UNIV;NATL CENT UNIV,A
2015.0,Geosci. Front.,Discrete rough set analysis of two different soilbehaviorinduced landslides in National SheiPa Park Taiwan,Chang S;Wan S,"The governing factors that influence landslide occurrences are complicated by the different soil conditions at various sites. To resolve the problem, this study focused on spatial information technology to collect data and information on geology. GIS, remote sensing and digital elevation model (DEM) were used in combination to extract the attribute values of the surface material in the vast study area of Shei-Pa National Park, Taiwan. The factors influencing landslides were collected and quantification values computed. The major soil component of loam and gravel in the Shei-Pa area resulted in different landslide problems. The major factors were successfully extracted from the influencing factors. Finally, the discrete rough set (DRS) classifier was used as a tool to find the threshold of each attribute contributing to landslide occurrence, based upon the knowledge database. This rule-based knowledge database provides an effective and urgent system to manage landslides. NDV1 (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), VI (Vegetation Index), elevation, and distance from the road are the four major influencing factors for landslide occurrence. The landslide hazard potential diagrams (landslide susceptibility maps) were drawn and a rational accuracy rate of landslide was calculated. This study thus offers a systematic solution to the investigation of landslide disasters. (C) 2015, China University of Geosciences (Beijing) and Peking University.

The system uses a stimulated Raman-scattering technique for the continuous observation of atmospheric aerosols, clouds and trace gases. This system has a fast scanning technique with a high-speed data acquisition, and permits the real-time measurement of atmospheric pollutants with the temporal resolution of 1 min. This scanning lidar system provides typical horizontal coverage of about 8-10 km while scanning; however, in zenith mode, good quality backscattered signals can be from 20 km, depending upon the laser power and sky conditions. This versatile lidar system has also overcome the drawbacks which are popular in the traditional scanning lidar systems such as complicated operation, overlap height between laser beam and telescope field of view In this system, the optical damage is reduced by using an integral coaxial transmitter and receiver. Some of the initial results obtained from the scanning lidar system are also presented. This study shows that boundary-layer structure and land-sea breeze circulation can be resolved from the developed scanning lidar system. The application of this lidar system to measure the pollutants over an industrial area is also discussed.","Kun Shan Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Tainan, Taiwan.;  Indian Inst Trop Meteorol, Pune, Maharashtra, India.;  Natl Cent Univ, Dept Phys, Chungli 32054, Taiwan.;  Taoyuan Cty Govt Environm Protect Bur, Taoyuan, Taiwan.;  EI LIDAR Corp Ltd, Taichung, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;INDIA;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,10,1.0,,"Chiang, CW (corresponding author), Kun Shan Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Tainan, Taiwan.",,,,10.5194/gi-4-35-2015,Article,CHUNG-LI 25-DEGREES-N; DIFFERENTIAL ABSORPTION; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; CIRRUS CLOUDS; AEROSOL LIDAR; 121-DEGREES-E; LAYER; PARTICLES; RADIATION; TAIWAN,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GEOSCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTATION METHODS AND DATA SYSTEMS,9,4,ISI,KUN SHAN UNIV;INDIAN INST TROP METEOROL;NATL CENT UNIV;TAOYUAN CTY GOVT ENVIRONM PROTECT BUR,KUN SHAN UNIV,A

2003.0,Geosci. J.,A structurecontrolled model for hot spring exploration in Taiwan by remote sensing,Liu J;Yu M;Ueng S,"Hot Spring Law of Taiwan was passed in legislative assembly on 3 June 2003. Hot springs would become one of the most important natural resources for recreation purposes. Both public and private sectors will invest large amount of capital in this area in the near future. The value of remote sensing technology is to give a critical tool for observing the landscape to find out mega-scaled geological structures, which may not be able to be found by conventional approaches. The occurrences of the hot springs in Taiwan are mostly in metamorphic and sedimentary rocks, other than in volcanic environments. Local geothermal anomaly or heat of springs transfer by liquid convection other than conduction or radiation. The deeply-seated fractures of hard rocks are the conduit of the convection of hot water, which could be as deep as 3000 meters in a hypothetical model of Taiwan. Clues to find outcrops of hot spring can be obtained by a structure-controlled model deduced by geological lineaments observed by satellite images and stereoscopic interpretation of aerial photographs. A case study conducted in Eastern Taiwan will be demonstrated.","Ind Technol Res Inst, ERL, Geospace Informat Technol Lab, Hsien 310, Taiwan.; Ind Technol Res Inst, ERL, Environm Resources & Hazard Mitigat Lab, Hsien 310, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,0.0,"Liu, JK (corresponding author), Ind Technol Res Inst, ERL, Geospace Informat Technol Lab, Bldg 24,195 Sec 4 Chung Hsing Rd, Hsien 310, Taiwan.",,,hot springs; geological model; remote sensing; photo-interpretation,10.1007/BF02919562,Article,,HANRIMWON PUBLISHING COMPANY,GEOSCIENCES JOURNAL,2,7,ISI,IND TECHNOL RES INST;IND TECHNOL RES INST,IND TECHNOL RES INST,B1

Zircons from the eastern Backbone Range and Eastern Central Range show Paleoproterozoic to late Neoarchean ages (23->= 2.5 Ga), whereas those from the Hsuehshan Range yield Neoarchean to Mesoarchean ages (2.6-12 Ga). The epsilon(Hf)(T) for the Paleoproterozoic to late Neoarchean zircons varies from -7.4 to +5.1, implying both juvenile crustal growth and reworking of old crusts. This dual origin could extend back to Mesoarchean-Paleoarchean (3.0-3.4 Ga) based on Hf isotopic model ages. Consistent but narrower epsilon(Hf)(T) values and Hf crustal model ages for zircons from Taiwan compared to Cathaysia suggest a possible common origin for these zircons, although Taiwan has a generally younger crustal evolution history than SE China.","Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei 115, Taiwan.;  Saitama Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Saitama 3888570, Japan.;  Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Chiayi 621, Taiwan.;  Tokyo Inst Technol, Lab Planetary Sci, Tokyo 1528551, Japan.;  Univ Tokyo, Earthquake Res Inst, Tokyo 1130032, Japan.;  Stanford Univ, Dept Geol & Environm Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;  Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Taipei 117, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;JAPAN;TAIWAN;JAPAN;JAPAN;USA;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,11,1.0,1.0,"Lan, CY (corresponding author), Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei 115, Taiwan.","Academia SinicaAcademia Sinica - Taiwan; National Science Council of the Republic of ChinaMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan; Earthquake Research Institute cooperative research program; Institute of Earth Sciences, Academia SinicaAcademia Sinica - Taiwan [1346]","Thanks are due to Prof Shigenori Maruyania (Tokyo Institute of Technology) for generous access to their equipnient.

2011.0,Geosci. J.,Crust and upper mantle structures of the region between Korea and Taiwan by surface wave dispersion study,Cho K;Chen H;Kang I;Lee S,"We have investigated the crust and upper-mantle shear velocity structures of the region between Korea and Taiwan by analyzing the path-averaged group-velocity dispersion characteristic curves derived from surface waves. The depth of the East China Sea between Korea and Taiwan is mostly less than 100 m. We selected data from earthquakes of magnitude greater than 6.0 that occurred in Taiwan from 1999 to 2007. We used data from 219 seismograms recorded at three-component broadband seismic stations in South Korea. We also used data from 19 events from South Taiwan for our study of crust and upper-mantle shear-wave velocity structures. By examining the wave period between 5 s and 100 s, the group velocities of Rayleigh waves and Love waves were inverted jointly. These waves were computed using the multiple filter technique (MFT) and using the single-station method. The inversion results from the dispersion curves provide a detailed one-dimensional velocity profile of the East China Sea. The main features of the derived velocity profile are: 1) the unconsolidated sediments surface layer shows a fairly low shear-wave velocity value; 2) the crustal shear-wave velocity increases from 2.92 km/s to 3.90 km/s, as the depth increases to 30 km; 3) shear-wave velocities in the uppermost mantle exhibit a clear low-velocity zone between 50 km and 90 km, with the velocity varying between 4.33 km/s and 3.99 km/s; 4) the variation in shear-wave velocities in the upper mantle increases with increasing depth. We can infer that the crustal structure of the study area is continental crust. The average Moho depth is 30 km beneath the East China Sea.","Korea Natl Oil Corp, Petr Technol Inst, Anyang 431711, South Korea.;  Natl Cent Univ, Inst Geophys, Jhongli 32001, Taoyuan County, Taiwan.;  Korea Inst Geosci & Mineral Resources, Taejon 305350, South Korea.;  Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Seoul 151747, South Korea.;",KOREA;TAIWAN;KOREA;KOREA,KOREA,KOREA,4,2.0,,"Cho, KH (corresponding author), Korea Natl Oil Corp, Petr Technol Inst, Anyang 431711, South Korea.","Ministry of Knowledge Economy of KoreaMinistry of Knowledge Economy, Republic of Korea",This study would not have been possible without the digital data sets provided by the Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resouces(KIGAM) and the Korea Meteorological Administration(KMA).

2013.0,Geosci. J.,An approach to evaluate groundwater recharge from streamflow and groundwater records,Kung W;Yeh H;Lin H;Chen W;Lee C,"To assess groundwater recharge, this study provided a composite method combining the recession-curve-displacement method and water-table fluctuation method. First, the initial recharge reference value was determined using the water-table fluctuation method. The corresponding groundwater discharge was then determined from the recharge reference value using the recession-curve-displacement method. Furthermore, the recession segment of the match between groundwater discharge and streamflow was computed. The recharge reference value was repeatedly adjusted to achieve a good fit with the recession segment for groundwater discharge and streamflow, thereby attaining the final groundwater recharge using the proposed method. Finally, the groundwater recharge of the Lanyang Creek basin in Taiwan was estimated as a case study. A comparison of recession-curve-displacement method and proposed composite method are presented. Estimation results show that the number of recharge events, recharge timing of these events, groundwater recharge events that satisfy recession theory, and range of transmissivity can be obtained using the proposed composite method. Comparison results demonstrate that the number of groundwater recharge events obtained with the composite method was greater than that acquired with the recession-curvedisplacement method. However, the annual recharge and seasonal recharge obtained with the recession-curve-displacement method and composite method were close.","Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Resources Engn, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.;  Chia Nan Univ Pharm & Sci, Dept Recreat & Hlth Care Management, Tainan, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,5,1.0,,"Lee, CH (corresponding author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Resources Engn, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.","National Science Council (NSC), Taiwan, R.O.C.Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [NSC 101-2221-E-006-196-MY2]; Central Geological Survey of Taiwan [102-5226904000-01-02]","This study was supported by the National Science Council (NSC), Taiwan, R.O.C., under grant NSC 101-2221-E-006-196-MY2 and Central Geological Survey of Taiwan under grant 102-5226904000-01-02.

On the basis of boring logs, borehole televiewer image data, and double packer hydraulic test data conducted in the Basin of Jhuoshuei River of central Taiwan with the aid of bivariate analysis, two rock mass permeability classification systems (Hydro-Potential value for Regolith (HPR) and Hydro-Potential value for Bedrock (HPB) System) were developed. By regression analysis, the dependence of HPB/HPR on in situ hydraulic conductivity was performed, and two empirical models for estimating in situ hydraulic conductivity were derived. Meanwhile, two derived models were validated through the comparison against results from other types of hydraulic test data (pumping and single packer tests). Therefore, the development of the empirical models for a groundwater-related project enables to help the planning of detailed investigations for the determination of hydraulic conductivity with cost-effectiveness.","Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Dept Harbor & River Engn, Keelung 20224, Taiwan.;  Sinotech Engn Consultant Inc, Geotech Engn Res Ctr, Taipei 11494, Taiwan.;  Minist Econ Affairs, Cent Geol Survey, New Taipei 23568, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,5,1.0,,"Hsu, SM (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Dept Harbor & River Engn, Keelung 20224, Taiwan.",,,regolith; fractured bedrock; in situ hydraulic conductivity; hydraulic test; groundwater,10.1007/s12303-019-0017-8,Article,HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; AQUIFER; FRACTURES; TESTS,GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY KOREA,GEOSCIENCES JOURNAL,4,24,ISI,NATL TAIWAN OCEAN UNIV;GEOTECH ENGN RES CTR,NATL TAIWAN OCEAN UNIV,A
2017.0,Geosci. Lett.,A meteor shockwave event recorded at seismic and infrasound stations in northern Taiwan,Kumar U;Chao B;Hsieh Y;Chang E,"Three mysterious explosion sounds were heard in the coastal towns of Tamsui, west of Taipei in northern Taiwan, in the early evening of December 5, 2013. The event left clear signals that are identified in the recordings of 12 regional seismometers and 3 infrasound sensors and processed by means of travel time analysis. The apparent velocity of similar to 330 m/s of the signals confirms that the energy transmission was through the atmosphere, and the characteristics of the waveforms suggest the meteor-generated shockwaves. We use the graphical method as well as the Genetic Algorithm optimization approach to constrain the trajectory of the meteor and to locate its projected intercept with the ground-(25.33 N, 121.26 E), approximately 20 km off the coast of Tamsui. The trajectory has azimuth (measured from north in a map view in the clockwise direction) of 303 degrees and (near-vertical) elevation angle of 70 degrees. From the observed period of 1.3 s at the maximum amplitude of the infrasound signal, we estimate by conventional scaling law that the meteor in question had impact energy on the order of 5 x 10(10) J (equivalent to an earthquake of local magnitude 4) or roughly a size of similar to 0.5 m across.","Acad Sinica, Earth Syst Sci ESS Program, TIGP, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, 128,Sec 2,Acad Rd, Taipei 11529, Taiwan.;  Natl Cent Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Jhongli, Taiwan.;  Kyoto Univ, Res Inst Sustainable Humanosphere, Kyoto, Japan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, Taipei, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;JAPAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,4,1.0,1.0,"Kumar, U (corresponding author), Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, 128,Sec 2,Acad Rd, Taipei 11529, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and Technology of TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [103-2611-M-002-004, 103-2811-M-001-049, 104-2611-M-002-013, 105-2116-M-001-016]","This work is partially supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan through Grants #103-2611-M-002-004, #103-2811-M-001-049, #104-2611-M-002-013, and #105-2116-M-001-016.",Meteor; Shockwave; Seismogram; Infrasound; Trajectory; Genetic Algorithm,10.1186/s40562-017-0079-2,Article,GENETIC ALGORITHMS; FIREBALLS; INVERSION; SATELLITE; NETWORK; CAMERA; FALL,SPRINGER,GEOSCIENCE LETTERS,1,4,ISI,ACAD SINICA;INST EARTH SCI;NATL CENT UNIV;KYOTO UNIV;NATL TAIWAN UNIV,INST EARTH SCI,B1

In our previous study, the Weather Research and Forecasting model was applied to investigate the impact of soil moisture initialization and soil texture on land-air interactions for a short-term 1-month period, in which two typhoons hit Taiwan and the atmospheric condition were wet. In this study, we extend the simulation period to 6months and target a drought period. The simulation period is from October 1, 2014 to March 31, 2015. During this study period, a lack of rain caused the drought and strict water rationing was enforced in Taiwan. The study objectives are (1) to understand the effect of soil moisture initialization and soil texture on land-air interactions during the 6-month drought period and (2) to identify the distinction between the previous study, where the atmospheric condition was wet, and the current 6-month drought period. Compared to the previous 1-month simulation, the land-air interactions are strengthened in the 6-month drought period, showing the enhanced impact of soil moisture variations on the surface heat flux, air temperature, and local circulation. In addition, the evapotranspiration process is strengthened in this study, indicating that the land-air interactions are significant when the atmospheric condition is dry. A soil moisture-limited evapotranspiration regime was identified in the previous 1-month wet period study, with the soil moisture strongly constraining the evapotranspiration. However, in this study, the evapotranspiration process can be independent of the soil moisture content, once the soil moisture is lower than the wilting point.","Natl Cent Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, 300 Chun Da Rd, Chungli, Taoyuan County, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,,"Cheng, FY (corresponding author), Natl Cent Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, 300 Chun Da Rd, Chungli, Taoyuan County, Taiwan.",Ministry of Science and Technology [MOST 105-2621-M-008-001],"This study was conducted under the research project entitled 'Development of high resolution atmospheric modeling and long-term atmospheric data sets in Taiwan and East Asia', supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology, under Grant Number MOST 105-2621-M-008-001.

Using constrained random walks, mass points are routed from defined release pixels of one to many mass movements through a digital elevation model until a defined break criterion is reached. Compared to existing tools, the major innovative features of r.randomwalk are (i) multiple break criteria can be combined to compute an impact indicator score; (ii) the uncertainties of break criteria can be included by performing multiple parallel computations with randomized parameter sets, resulting in an impact indicator index in the range 0-1; (iii) built-in functions for validation and visualization of the results are provided; (iv) observed landslides can be back analysed to derive the density distribution of the observed angles of reach. This distribution can be employed to compute impact probabilities for each pixel. Further, impact indicator scores and probabilities can be combined with release indicator scores or probabilities, and with exposure indicator scores. We demonstrate the key functionalities of r.randomwalk for (i) a single event, the Acheron rock avalanche in New Zealand; (ii) landslides in a 61.5 km(2) study area in the Kao Ping Watershed, Taiwan; and (iii) lake outburst floods in a 2106 km(2) area in the Gunt Valley, Tajikistan.","Univ Vienna, Dept Geog & Reg Res, Geomorphol Syst & Risk Res, A-1190 Vienna, Austria.;  Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci BOKU, Inst Appl Geol, A-1190 Vienna, Austria.;  Univ Canterbury, Dept Geol Sci, Christchurch 1, New Zealand.;  Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Geomat, Tainan 701, Taiwan.;",AUSTRIA;AUSTRIA;NEW ZEALAND;TAIWAN,AUSTRIA,AUSTRIA,3,4.0,2.0,"Mergili, M (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Dept Geog & Reg Res, Geomorphol Syst & Risk Res, Univ Str 7, A-1190 Vienna, Austria.",Austrian Science Fund (FWF)Austrian Science Fund (FWF); German Research Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG); Austrian Science Fund (FWF)Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [I 1600] Funding Source: researchfish,"The work was conducted as part of the international cooperation project ""A GIS simulation model for avalanche and debris flows"" funded by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) and the German Research Foundation (DFG).

Several innovative physical and chemical parameterizations, including trigger functions for deep convection, cloud macrophysics, aerosol, and three-dimensional radiation-topography interaction, as well as a one-dimensional mixed-layer model optional for the atmosphere component, are incorporated. The precipitation variability, such as diurnal cycle and propagation of convection systems, is improved in TaiESM. TaiESM demonstrates good model stability in the 500-year preindustrial simulation in terms of the net flux at the top of the model, surface temperatures, and sea ice concentration. In the historical simulation, although the warming before 1935 is weak, TaiESM captures the increasing trend of temperature after 1950 well. The current climatology of TaiESM during 1979-2005 is evaluated by observational and reanalysis datasets. Cloud amounts are too large in TaiESM, but their cloud forcing is only slightly weaker than observational data. The mean bias of the sea surface temperature is almost 0, whereas the surface air temperatures over land and sea ice regions exhibit cold biases. The overall performance of TaiESM is above average among models in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5, particularly in that the bias of precipitation is smallest. However, several common discrepancies shared by most models still exist, such as the double Intertropical Convergence Zone bias in precipitation and warm bias over the Southern Ocean.","Acad Sinica, Res Ctr Environm Changes, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Natl Ctr Environm Protect, Camp Springs, MD USA.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;USA,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,9,1.0,,"Lee, WL (corresponding author), Acad Sinica, Res Ctr Environm Changes, Taipei, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and Technology, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan; MOST [106-2111-M-001-002, MOST 106-2111-M-001-005, MOST 1072111-M-001-012]","This research has been supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan (grant nos.

2021.0,Geosci. Model Dev.,GTS v10 a macrophysics scheme for climate models based on a probability density function,Shiu C;Wang Y;Hsu H;Chen W;Pan H;Sun R;Chen Y;Chen C,"Cloud macrophysics schemes are unique parameterizations for general circulation models. We propose an approach based on a probability density function (PDF) that utilizes cloud condensates and saturation ratios to replace the assumption of critical relative humidity (RH). We test this approach, called the Global Forecast System (GFS) - Taiwan Earth System Model (TaiESM) - Sundqvist (GTS) scheme, using the macrophysics scheme within the Community Atmosphere Model version 5.3 (CAM5.3) framework. Via single-column model results, the new approach simulates the cloud fraction (CF)-RH distributions closer to those of the observations when compared to those of the default CAM5.3 scheme. We also validate the impact of the GTS scheme on global climate simulations with satellite observations. The simulated CF is comparable to CloudSat/CloudAerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) data. Comparisons of the vertical distributions of CF and cloud water content (CWC), as functions of large-scale dynamic and thermodynamic parameters, with the CloudSat/CALIPSO data suggest that the GTS scheme can closely simulate observations. This is particularly noticeable for thermodynamic parameters, such as RH, upper-tropospheric temperature, and total precipitable water, implying that our scheme can simulate variation in CF associated with RH more reliably than the default scheme. Changes in CF and CWC would affect climatic fields and large-scale circulation via cloud-radiation interaction. Both climatological means and annual cycles of many of the GTS-simulated variables are improved compared with the default scheme, particularly with respect to water vapor and RH fields. Different PDF shapes in the GTS scheme also significantly affect global simulations.","Acad Sinica, Res Ctr Environm Changes, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.;  NOAA, Natl Ctr Environm Predict, College Pk, MD USA.;  Univ Michigan, Dept Climate & Space Sci & Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;USA;USA,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,8,1.0,,"Shiu, CJ (corresponding author), Acad Sinica, Res Ctr Environm Changes, Taipei, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan (MOST) [1002119-M-001-029-MY5, 105-2119-M-002-028-MY3]","This research has been supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan (MOST (grant nos. 1002119-M-001-029-MY5 and 105-2119-M-002-028-MY3)).",,10.5194/gmd-14-177-2021,Article,PROGNOSTIC CLOUD FRACTION; ORDER TURBULENCE CLOSURE; SATELLITE-OBSERVATIONS; BOUNDARY-LAYER; PART I; PARAMETERIZATION; SCALE; CONDENSATION; CONVECTION; PARAMETRIZATION,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT,3,14,ISI,ACAD SINICA;NATL TAIWAN UNIV;COLLEGE PK;UNIV MICHIGAN,ACAD SINICA,A
2018.0,Geosciences,Stable Hydrogen and Oxygen Isotopes for Groundwater Sources of Penghu Islands Taiwan,Yeh H;Lee J,"This study used stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes as natural tracers to investigate their isotopic composition in precipitation, and in shallow and deep groundwater in the Penghu Islands in the Taiwan Strait. We aimed to understand the differences and relationships in isotope compositions within various water bodies and to evaluate the source of groundwater recharge. The hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions of sampled groundwater are mainly distributed along the meteoric water line in the Penghu Islands, the variations in the distribution range being minor (the delta D values are distributed from -48.2% to -37.7%, with a mean value of -43.14 +/- 2.4%; the delta O-18 values are distributed from -6.96% to -5.46%, with a mean value of -6.34 +/- 0.34%). The data suggest that the groundwater is sourced mainly from local precipitation. In addition, a comparison of the hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions of groundwater and precipitation in Taiwan shows that the delta values for groundwater are distributed between those for precipitation during the northeast monsoon and the southwest monsoon seasons. However, some of the delta values trends towards the isotopic composition of the precipitation during the southwest monsoon season. Thus, the source of groundwater may have a closer association with precipitation during this time.","Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Resources Engn, Tainan 701, Taiwan.;  Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Hydraul & Ocean Engn, Tainan 701, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,,"Yeh, HF (corresponding author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Resources Engn, Tainan 701, Taiwan.","Water Resources Agency of the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the Republic of China, Taiwan [MOEAWRA1050378]","The authors would like to thank the Water Resources Agency of the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the Republic of China, Taiwan for financially supporting this research under grant MOEAWRA1050378.

Connectivity between biophysical and socio-economic components and a community-based perspective on appreciation and interpretation of landscape resources are important yet not well understood. This study is a retrospective analysis of 15 years (2006-2021) of integrated landscape management in Fengnan Village, Hualien County, Taiwan, with a focus on the evolution of multi-stakeholder perception of local geodiversity and emergence of geotourism as part of community-based landscape tourism in the area. A qualitative multiple-method approach to data collection and analysis was based on the ""know-cherish-show"" interpretation model and the theory of collaborative planning. The results demonstrate that (a) geoconservation and geotourism have evolved to become an integral part of the Fengnan living landscape, while connectivity between nature-culture attributes has strengthened over the years; (b) multi-stakeholder collaboration and knowledge-bridging are characteristic features of the institutional arrangement; and (c) facilitating the role of the bridging stakeholder (the authors) was central to the timely introduction of various landscape concepts for long-term geoconservation in the area.","Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Coll Environm Studies, Shoufeng Township 974301, Hualien County, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,,"Lee, KC (corresponding author), Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Coll Environm Studies, Shoufeng Township 974301, Hualien County, Taiwan.",Council of Cultural Affairs; Forestry Bureau (Council of Agriculture); Hualien Forest District Office of the Forestry Bureau; Ministry of Education; Institute for Global Environmental Strategies; Hualien Cultural Affairs Bureau of the Council for Cultural Affairs,"At different stages, this research was funded by the Council of Cultural Affairs, the Hualien Cultural Affairs Bureau of the Council for Cultural Affairs, the Forestry Bureau (Council of Agriculture), the Hualien Forest District Office of the Forestry Bureau, the Ministry of Education, and the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies.",geoconservation; cultural landscape; geopark; community-based landscape tourism; multi-stakeholder partnership; Taiwan,10.3390/geosciences11080310,Article,ARC-CONTINENT COLLISION; GEODIVERSITY; EVOLUTION; GEOTOURISM,MDPI,GEOSCIENCES,0,11,ISI,NATL DONG HWA UNIV,NATL DONG HWA UNIV,A
2013.0,Geosphere,Structural inheritance and erosional controls on thrust kinematics in western Taiwan,Wilcox T;Mueller K;Upton P;Powell L;Chen Y;Huang S;Yanites B;Tucker G,"Late Quaternary shortening along the length of the Western Foothills of Taiwan highlights the tectonic segmentation of the foreland and raises questions about the relationship between erosion and the thickness of synorogenic foreland basin fill, and their influence on thrust kinematics. We compare measurements of shortening with geodetic observations and numerical model results, and relate these to regional topography. Predictions of shortening from numerical modeling and observed strain gradients within central Taiwan are generally similar in terms of their scaling and kinematic behavior. Within this framework, the current deformation field is likely related to the inheritance of older passive-margin structures in the foreland, as well as to the easily erodible nature of the 5-km-thick sequence of synorogenic sediment accreted at the leading edge of the orogen in the last 1.1 m.y. Additionally, available constraints on the timing of recent activity of faults suggest that infilling of piggy-back or wedge-top basins there occurred rapidly, contemporaneously with the activation of the frontal thrust and a possible increase in the rate of shortening across the adjacent thrust sheet toward the center of the orogen.","Univ Colorado, Dept Geol Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.;  GNS Sci, Lower Hutt 5040, New Zealand.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.;  CPC Corp, Wen Sheng 36042, Miaoli, Taiwan.;",USA;NEW ZEALAND;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,USA,USA,8,3.0,2.0,"Wilcox, T (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Geol Sci, 2200 Colorado Ave, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [EAR-0510971, EAR-0510051]","We would like to acknowledge the Chinese Petroleum Company, Dr. Wen-Rong Chi, and Kenn-Ming Yang for access to their data and many helpful discussions.

2003.0,Geosynth. Int.,Seismic displacements of geosyntheticreinforced soil modular block walls,Huang C;Chou L;Tatsuoka F,Four geosynthetic-reinforced soil modular block (GRS-MB) retaining walls that behaved differently during the 1999 Taiwan Chi-Chi earthquake were investigated by field surveying and soil testing. Pseudo-static analyses based on the two-wedge failure mechanism were performed to investigate the seismic stability of such GRS-MB walls. The analyses considered the structural function of the stacked block facing and the contribution of reinforcement-facing connection strength to the seismic stability of GRS-MB retaining walls. It was found that the facing-reinforcement connection strength and the block-block shear resistance strongly affect the seismic stability and seismic displacement of GRS-MB retaining walls. Newmark's sliding block theory together with a 'displacement diagram' were used to evaluate the seismic displacements of the investigated walls. The displacement analyses give the values of horizontal seismic displacement of the discrete modular block facing and the vertical settlement of the backfill soil. It was found that the calculated values of wall displacements were comparable with the measured ones when the structural effects of the facing were properly accounted for. The effect of buckling mode deformation of the stacked blocks on the horizontal displacement of the GRS-MB walls is also evaluated quantitatively.,"Natl Chi Nan Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Puli 545, Nanton, Taiwan.; Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.; Univ Tokyo, Dept Civil Engn, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 113, Japan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;JAPAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,,"Huang, CC (corresponding author), Natl Chi Nan Univ, Dept Civil Engn, 1 Univ Rd, Puli 545, Nanton, Taiwan.",,,geosynthetics; failure; geosynthetic-reinforced modular block wall; pseudo-static analysis; seismic displacement; seismic stability,10.1680/gein.2003.10.1.2,Article,RESPONSE ANALYSIS,ICE PUBLISHING,GEOSYNTHETICS INTERNATIONAL,50,10,ISI,NATL CHI NAN UNIV;NATL CHENG KUNG UNIV;UNIV TOKYO,NATL CHI NAN UNIV,A

Int.,Weathering properties of geotextiles in ocean environments,Hsieh C;Wang J;Chiu Y,This paper provides data on weathering properties and reduction factors for two geotextiles in ocean environments. The study included outdoor ultraviolet (UV) exposure tests performed at the Harbor and Marine Technology Research Center in Taiwan using a black polypropylene and a white polyester geotextile. Ultraviolet exposure was the most significant factor in reducing the strength properties of the geotextiles tested in an ocean environment. Seawater immersion had the least weathering effect on the engineering properties of the test geotextiles among the test conditions. The effect on engineering properties of placing samples within the tidal zone was slightly higher than that for the immersion condition. Reduction factors for UV exposure and seawater weathering for the test geotextiles are reported. © 2006 Thomas Telford Ltd.,"Department of Civil Engineering, National Pingtung University of Science and Technology, No. 1 Shueh-Fu Road, Neipu, Pingtung, Taiwan; Research Center of Harbor and Marine Technology, Wuchi, Taichung, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,,"Hsieh, C.W.; Department of Civil Engineering, No. 1 Shueh-Fu Road, Neipu, Pingtung, Taiwan; 電子郵件: cwh@mail.npust.edu.tw",,NA NA NA,Degradation;  Geosynthetics;  Geotextile;  Puncture strength;  Seawater;  Tear strength;  Tensile strength;  Weathering,10.1680/gein.2006.13.5.210,Article,Degradation;  Polyesters;  Polypropylenes;  Seawater;  Tensile strength;  Ultraviolet devices;  Weathering; Reduction factors;  Ultraviolet (UV) exposure tests; Geotextiles; degradation;  geosynthetics;  geotextile;  seawater;  tensile strength;  weathering; degradation;  geosynthetics;  geotextile;  polyester;  polypropylene;  strength;  tensile property;  testing;  ultraviolet resistance;  weather resistance,ICE Publishing,Geosynthetics International,10,13,scopus,NATIONAL PINGTUNG UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY;RESEARCH CENTER OF HARBOR AND MARINE TECHNOLOGY,NOTREPORTED,A
2012.0,Geotext. Geomembr.,Lessons learned from three failures on a high steep geogridreinforced slope,Liu C;Yang K;Ho Y;Chang C,"An excavated slope that connects the school campus and Tai-21 Road is located on the approaching road to Chi-Nan University in Nantou, Taiwan. The toe portion of this high and steep slope is reinforced by a PET geogrid, with the height of the reinforced zone ranging between 10 meters (m) and 40 m at different sections. A slope failure occurred during construction of the reinforced slope in 1994. A massive failure of the reinforced slope then happened at the 40 m high section when the Chi-Chi (Taiwan) earthquake struck on September 21, 1999. The failure portion was rehabilitated, but another failure of the reinforced slope took place at another 20 m high section after a heavy rainstorm on July 2, 2004. The research herein presents the information and the history of these PET geogrid-reinforced slope failures. We perform extensive field observations and numerical analyses to examine the failure mechanism and causes contributing to these failures. Lessons learned from these case histories, with regard to carrying Out a detailed site investigation, selecting permeable materials as backfill, installing drainage systems appropriately and combining the design of a reinforced slope with other types of retaining structures to improve the system global stability, are also discussed.

1970.0,Geothermics,Exploration of geothermal resources in the Tatun volcanic region Taiwan Republic of China,Tsung F T;Kong H K,"The Tatun volcanic region is located on the northern tip of Taiwan. It covers an area of about 320 square kilometers. It is composed of andesitic lava flows and pyroclastics. The basement rocks are Miocene sediments. In view of the strong surface thermal manifestations in the region, it was chosen as the first area in Taiwan for geothermal exploration. Exploration work was commenced in November, 1965 and has been carried on until now by the Mining Research and Service Organization. About 150 square kilometers on a scale of 1 to 10,000 have been mapped geologically. The total surveyed area will be 200 square kilometers. Chemical analyses have been made for hot springs, fumaroles, and drillhole discharges. A onemeter-depth temperature survey was completed in early 1967. Although this survey did not give very much information on the temperature anomaly at depth, it can help delineate the boundaries of individual hot areas and may help trace out certain structural trends. Both electric resistivity survey and magnetic survey have been applied in this volcanic region in search of hot hydrothermally altered zones. But the results are difficult to interpret, for the region is characterized by high relief and heterogeneous petrographic composition. There were 58 small (1 7/8"" - 3"" in diameter) and shallow (47 - 155 meters in depth) gradient wells drilled in the region. The total footage was 6625 meters. These wells proved to be useful for siting future exploration wells. Up to date, 7 exploration wells ranging from 441 to 1005 meters in depth have been drilled. A temperature as high as 240 °C has been measured at the bottom of the 1005 meters deep well. A 1500 meters deep exploration well is under drilling and is to be completed in August, 1969. © 1971.","Mining Research and Serv.

1970.0,Geothermics,Geophysical exploration in the Tatun volcanic region Taiwan,Cheng W,"This is an introduction to geophysical exploration in the Tatun volcanic region in Taiwan. Two prospecting methods of geophysical investigation, magnetic and electrical resistivity survey, were applied at both the Tahuangtsui and Matsao geothermal areas from March 1967 to August 1968. The magnetic survey was used as a reconnaissance investigation to delineate the outline of the hydrothermally altered zone on the surface, while the electrical resistivity survey was used to find the thermal fluid bearing low-resistivity zone, and to understand the subsurface structure if the VES (vertical electric sounding) data could be interpreted rather quantitatively. Both magnetic and resistivity surveys shows interesting results. High magnetic anomalies are often associated with andesites and pyroclastic rocks, and low magnetic anomalies appear in the hydrothermally altered zone and the area of Tertiary sediments as expected. Also the magnetic contours are somewhat consistent with the topographic relief which is generally formed by the steep-sided andesite lava flows and volcanic domes in the surveyed area. The electrical resistivity survey at the Tahuangtsui area was carried out with two methods, horizontal exploration and vertical sounding. The VES data were interpreted semiquantitatively and the subsurface structure of the surveyed area was then inferred accordingly. In the Matsao area, the subsurface geological conditions were little known before the resistivity measurement began; therefore the resistivity survey in this area was used to get information about the subsurface geology and structure; hence the vertical sounding was applied primarily. The VES curves obtained show very complicated figures indicating the high complexity of subsurface geology and structural features. However, a qualitative interpretation was made. Evaluated from the VES data and the experimental result, the resistivities of various rocks in the surveyed area are as follows: A table is presented. © 1971.","Mining Research and Service Organization, Ministry of Economic Affairs, Taipei, Taiwan",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,1,1.0,0.0,"Cheng, W.T.; Mining Research and Service Organization, Ministry of Economic Affairs, Taipei, Taiwan",,NA NA,,10.1016/0375-6505(70)90025-8,Article,,,Geothermics,1,2,scopus,MINING RESEARCH AND SERVICE ORGANIZATION,MINING RESEARCH AND SERVICE ORGANIZATION,B2
2005.0,Geothermics,Interpretation of a well interference test at the Chingshui geothermal field Taiwan,Fan K;Kuo M;Liang K;Lee C;Chiang S,Production in the liquid-dominated Chingshui geothermal field is largely from a fractured zone in the Jentse Member of the Miocene Lushan Formation. The geological data strongly indicate a possibility of linear-flow geometry on a field-wide scale. This was confirmed by re-analyzing the results of a multiple-well interference test performed in 1979. Radial and linear-flow models were used in this process. An evaluation of computed reservoir transmissivities and well capacities indicated that a linear model fitted the interference test data significantly better than a radial model. The linear-flow model that was developed for the Chingshui reservoir was also instrumental in obtaining an improved estimation of the geothermal fluid reserves (i.e. fluid-in-place). (C) 2004 CNR.

2014.0,Geothermics,Evaluating the Chingshui geothermal reservoir in northeast Taiwan with a 3D integrated geophysical visualization model,Chang P;Lo W;Song S;Ho K;Wu C;Chen C;Lai Y;Chen H;Lu H,"In the current study, we assess the Chingshui geothermal reservoir with a three-dimensional visualization model that integrates geophysical measurements with well logs. To re-evaluate the geothermal reservoir quantitatively, we reprocessed resistivity measurements from a series of studies conducted nearly 40 years ago, as well as from the magnetotelluric (MT) explorations performed recently in the Chingshui area. We established a three-dimensional (3D) visualization model that integrates these different geophysical survey results as well as the well-logs to better perform the spatial relationships between them. From the orthogonal bipole-bipole resistivity surveys, we have identified several regional conductive structures with resistivity of less than 50 Ohm-m representing the major fault zones of the Dahsi, Xiaonanao, and Chingshuihsi faults. Among them, the Chingshui fault is located along the Chingshuihsi River valley and is associated with hot spring features. The collinear Schlumberger survey along the Chingshuichi Valley identified three relatively conductive regions with resistivity of less than 20 Ohm-m. The MT interpretation shows that the structure associated with the geothermal reservoir extends from these near-surface fractures to a depth of -1500m toward the south in the fault zone. The identified production zone from the core drilling records is consistent with the conductive structure in the MT inverted image. In addition, the structure seems to consist of two sub-regions: a somewhat shallow one at a depth of between -400 and -800 m in the north and a somewhat deep one at a depth of between -600 and -1500 m in the south. From the 3D model, we estimate that the volume of the Chingshui geothermal reservoir is about 9.54 x 10(7) m(3). Given a gross porosity of 0.1 and 100% saturation for the fracture zones from the core logs, the inferred Chingshui geothermal reservoir contains about 10 million cubic meters of geothermal fluids.

2016.0,Geothermics,GPR investigation of the nearsurface geology in a geothermal river valley using contemporary data decomposition techniques with forward simulation modeling,Chen C;Jeng Y,"Although geophysical studies on the geothermal field are in favor of deep structures, the shallow investigations are needed for understanding the local hydrological regime and assessing environmental compliance when setting up a geothermal power plant. We demonstrate the possibility of investigating the shallow structure of a complex site of the geothermal valley located at Chingshui, northeast Taiwan by using the ground penetrating radar (GPR) with advanced data processing techniques. Taking the challenging topography into account, the low frequency (50 MHz) unshielded bistatic GPR antennas were transported above the ground to prevent from submerging in water and avoid the surface obstacles. Two newly developed data processing techniques, the multidimensional ensemble empirical mode decomposition (MDEEMD) and multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD), with the Hilbert-Huang spectrogram analysis were applied to the data. For each survey line, an initial subsurface layer model was generated by referring to the processed field data, and the finalized subsurface layer model accompanying the synthetic GPR profile were obtained with the aid of the finite difference time domain (FDTD) numerical simulation modeling. The results of this study suggest that the undulation reflections shown in each survey line are folding structures extending from the cliff edge, and that no evidence of fault traces near the surface is found. Apart from the geological findings, we believe that the field technique in conjunction with the proposed data processing method can overcome the topographic difficulties of the geothermal field and may provide better subsurface image of an area with poor GPR reflection quality.

2016.0,Geothermics,Subsurface temperature trends in response to thermal water exploitation in the Jiashi Hot Spring northeastern Taiwan,Chen W;Chiang H,"Temperature monitoring provides important information for the sustainable management of a geothermal field. Previous studies indicate that a decline in aquifer pressure is an obvious indicator of thermal water overexploitation. However, many thermal water producing aquifers display a subtle temperature change rather than a pressure decline. Due to the importance of monitoring temperature change, temperature detection is an important topic in the sustainable management of geothermal fields. In this study, we used borehole temperature-depth curves, obtained from boreholes measured over half-year intervals from 2011 to 2014, as well as the Mann-Kendall method, to determine trends for subsurface temperature within the Jiashi Hot Spring in Taiwan. Our results indicate that trends for subsurface temperature are related to hydrogeology and the flow field of groundwater. Groundwater/thermal water flow directions are impacted by the exploitation of thermal water in production wells, according to their depths and distributions, but pressure declines are not a dominant feature. Repeatedly measured borehole temperature-depths and their resultant curves provide important information for understanding trends in subsurface temperature change within a geothermal field.

2018.0,Geothermics,An ideal geothermometer in slate formation A case from the Chingshui geothermal field Taiwan,Huang Y;Liu H;Song S;Chen H,"The use of geothermometers derived from fluid solution compositions is a well-established practice for estimating geothermal reservoir temperatures. The most commonly used geothermometers in hot-spring environments are based on the solubility of SiO2, mineral equilibria involving the exchange of Na-K and K-Mg, and the empirically-derived Na-K-Ca geothermometer. The preferred geothermometer for a reservoir is determined based on the rock type of each specific reservoir. Geothermal reservoirs in the Chingshui Region of northeastern Taiwan are predominantly composed of slate. Therefore, this study examines water-rock interaction in a slate environment to determine the ideal geothermometer for estimating reservoir temperature in the Chingshui Region. Water-rock interaction experiments between 100 degrees C to 300 degrees C were conducted at various durations with the longest being 60 days. The traditional experiment of a closed system was modified into a two-step system by separating solid and reacted liquid during cooling. Comparison with the major elemental geothermometers and agreement with downhole temperature measurements indicate that the silica geothermometer is the most useful in assessing subsurface temperatures in the Chingshui hot-springs region and in the slate environment.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Inst Earth Sci, Keelung 20224, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,4,1.0,1.0,"Chen, HF (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Inst Earth Sci, Keelung 20224, Taiwan.","National Science CouncilMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [NSC 104-3113-M-002-002, NSC103-3113-M-002-002, NSC 102-3113-P-002-013]","The study is funded by the three-year project from National Science Council (NSC 104-3113-M-002-002, NSC103-3113-M-002-002 and NSC 102-3113-P-002-013).

2018.0,Geothermics,Conceptual model of the Tatun geothermal system Taiwan,Dobson P;Gasperikova E;Spycher N;Lindsey N;Guo T;Chen W;Liu C;Wang C;Chen S;Fowler A,"The Tatun geothermal system, located in northern Taiwan, is hosted by the Plio-Pleistocene Tatun volcanic group, consisting dominantly of andesitic lavas, domes and pyroclastic flows. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, geologic mapping, geochemical sampling, geophysical surveys, and the drilling of numerous exploration and temperature gradient wells were conducted at Tatun under the leadership of the Mineral Research and Service Organization (MRSO), the predecessor to the geothermal group at the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI). Deep (1-2 km) wells encountered commercial temperatures (200-300 degrees C) in the Matsao area, but these initial exploration efforts were discouraged by the presence of very acidic (pH < 3.5) and highly corrosive fluids. Numerous geoscience studies conducted over the past 15 years at Tatun have shown that the central portion of the system is dominated by corrosive volcanic fluids, as evidenced by abundant SO2 as well as HCI. More reduced gases are encountered on the flanks of the system, suggesting that water-rock interaction may have at least partly neutralized the volcanic-derived fluids on the margins of this geothermal system. Scientists from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) and ITRI have been working together to develop an updated evaluation of the Tatun geothermal system, with the goal of evaluating the geothermal resource potential of the NE margins of the Tatun geothermal system (Zone C), just outside of Yangmingshan National Park. This study provides a review and analysis of existing and new fluid geochemistry data, describes new magnetotelluric data and associated 3-D modeling conducted at LBNL, and incorporates these data and analyses with information from previous studies to create an updated conceptual model for the Tatun geothermal system, with a focus on the Zone C region. These data all suggest that the Zone C area is located on the margin of the main Tatun geothermal system. An exploration well drilled by ITRI will provide important constraints regarding the thermal regime and fluid compositions for this marginal portion of the system.","Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Energy Geosci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;  Ind Technol Res Inst, Green Energy & Environm Res Labs, Hsinchu, Taiwan.;  Minist Econ Affairs, Bur Energy, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Univ Calif Davis, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA.;  Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;  Univ Minnesota, Dept Earth Sci, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.;",USA;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;USA;USA;USA,USA,USA,10,2.0,1.0,"Dobson, P (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Energy Geosci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.","Industrial Technology Research Institute from Berkeley Lab [WF10910]; Office of Science, of the U.S. Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC02-05CH11231]","This work is dedicated to the memory of Prof. Frank Yang, whose group conducted the fundamental work on gas geochemistry at Tatun.

2018.0,Geothermics,Evolution of hot fluids in the Chingshui geothermal field inferred from crystal morphology and geochemical vein data,Lu Y;Song S;Taguchi S;Wang P;Yeh E;Lin Y;MacDonald J;John C,"The Chingshui geothermal field once hosted the first geothermal power plant in Taiwan from 1981 to 1993. After a long period of inactivity, this field is attracting renewed interest to meet the need for clean energy. A 213-m length of cores (IC-21) with continuous recovery, the longest in the Chingshui geothermal field, was recovered from 600 m to 813 m below the surface in 2010. Three types of calcite crystal morphologies have been identified in the veins of the cores of well IC-21: bladed, rhombic and massive crystals. Bladed calcites are generated via degassing under boiling conditions with a precipitation temperature of similar to 165 degrees C and calculated delta O-18 value of -6.8 parts per thousand to -10.2 parts per thousand VSMOW for the thermal water. Rhombic calcites grow in low concentration Ca2+ and CO32- meteoric fluids and precipitate at approximately similar to 180 degrees C. Finally, massive calcites are characterized by co-precipitation with quartz in the mixing zone between meteoric water and magmatic or metamorphic fluids with calculated delta O-18 value of up to 1.5 +/- 0.7 parts per thousand VSMOW. Furthermore, the scaling and hot fluids at a nearby pilot geothermal power plant confirm a meteoric origin. Based on these observations, we propose that the current orientations of the main conduits for geothermal fluids are oriented at N10 degrees E with a dip of 70 degrees E. This result provides the basic information needed for deploying production and injection wells in future developments of the geothermal power plant in this region.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Fukuoka Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Fukuoka, Japan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Imperial Coll London, Dept Earth Sci & Engn, London, England.;  Univ Glasgow, Sch Geog & Earth Sci, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.;",TAIWAN;JAPAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;UNITED KINGDOM;UNITED KINGDOM,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,8,1.0,1.0,"Song, SR (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Taiwan [MOST 103-3113-M-002-001, MOST 104-3113-M-002-001, MOST 105-3113-M-002-001]","This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Taiwan [MOST 103-3113-M-002-001, MOST 104-3113-M-002-001, and MOST 105-3113-M-002-001].

The triangular shaped Yilan Plain, our study area chosen for a geothermal development pilot project, resides at the southwestern end of the Okinawa Trough behind the Ryukyu Arc-Trench where the Philippine Sea Plate is subducting beneath the Eurasian Plate with low-grade metamorphic rocks exposed in the surrounding mountain ranges. Play Fairway Analysis (PFA) is adapted to demonstrate important aspects, predicting geothermal potential through quantitative and statistical methods in a given type by overlapping each element layer into a composite favorability map with properly calculated weights accounting for uncertainty levels. Highlighted exploratory sweet spots on a regional scale can be identified with the easy-to-read map for decision-making stakeholders. Three components are selected for this analysis: they include (1) heat sources: with temperatures of hot springs, geothermal gradients, and silica geothermometry, (2) permeable fracture networks: with fault lines, drainage network, micro-earthquake activities, and dilation rate distribution, and (3) human activities: with population density, sediment thickness, and hazardous risk. Expert opinion on factor weighting for two geological components and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) for the socioeconomic component are utilized to determine weightings representing the assigned confidence and uncertainty levels. ArcGIS software is used as the platform for data processing and map demonstration. The final map displayed the combined geothermal favorability from the two geological aspects blocked out with the riskier zones from the socioeconomic aspect.

2018.0,Geothermics,Metamorphic geothermal reservoir characterisationA case study in the Jinlun geothermal area Taitung Taiwan,Guo T;Tong L;Huang Y,"There are more than one hundred hot spring outcrops around the island of Taiwan, which implies that Taiwan is rich in geothermal resources; however, no commercial geothermal power plants have been established since 1993, the year of the abandonment of a 3 MW geothermal plant in Chingshui. Situated at the oblique collision zone between Eurasia and Philippine Sea plates, most of Taiwan's hot springs are located in metamorphic terrain rather than volcanic areas. Previous study showed that geothermal resource is also rich in Jinlun area, whereas structural complexity and low permeability pose difficulties to geothermal exploitation. This paper aims to describe a geothermal conceptual model to facilitate the exploitation of the Jinlun geothermal field by integrating results from gravity, temperature surveys, surface geology, and information from recently conducted magnetotellurics survey and a new borehole. Results from the MT survey indicate a deep resistive structure down to 5 km depth. A zone of low resistivity (< 5 ohm-m), which coincides with elevated temperatures observed in the borehole, could be attributed to thrust faulting. Based on C-14 dating data, sources of geothermal brine could be connate water or meteoric water that travelled for a long distance. The main reservoir could be located at the fractured regions instead of porous strata.","Ind Technol Res Inst, Green Energy & Environm Res Labs, Hsinchu, Taiwan.;  Ind Technol Res Inst, Mat & Chem Res Labs, Hsinchu, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,1.0,"Guo, TR (corresponding author), Bldg 24,195,Sec 4,Chung Hsing Rd Chutung, Hsinchu 31040, Taiwan.","Bureau of Energy, MOEA, TaiwanMinistry of Economic Affairs, Taiwan","The authors would like to acknowledge the support from the Bureau of Energy, MOEA, Taiwan, and the valuable discussion on the geothermal conceptual model with MU staff, namely, Dr. Lin, W., Dr. Hsieh, P.S., and Dr. Chen, K.Y.

2018.0,Geothermics,Scenario analysis on operational productivity for target EGS reservoir in Ilan area Taiwan,Yu C;Lei S;Yang C;Chen W;Song S,"A basic production scenario analysis (BPSA) using the TOUGH2 code (coupled with a fit-for-purpose modified EGS module) as a relevant simulator was conducted to study a potential geothermal site in I-Ian Triangle, Taiwan. The outcome of numerical simulation shows that the capability of the code is compliant with heat production model analysis under a pair of recharging and production wells. In the BPSA application, the model was constituted with an assumed size of 2 km x 2 km x 2.5 km, taking into consideration a relevant boundary condition and using Case-A, B, and C to represent varied depths of recharging points. Heat production histories of target reservoirs containing a fault zone were simulated using a deterministic approach, and a collection of 30 year heat production P/T histories was obtained for all 3 cases. The effects of a fault zone near the production point are evaluated and found to be significant only when distance between the fault's boundary and production point is minimum. The study also shows that relative locations of the recharging point from production point are important to reach an adequate design of production well layout in a geothermal plant. Significant temperature decline can be observed in Case-C of BPSA, where the distance between R-1 and P-1 is the least among the 3 cases studied. Results of this study would provide a useful numerical tool for evaluating future EGS development projects in Taiwan. By adopting a suitable conceptual model and a group of carefully selected relevant parameters, site-specific reservoir engineering problems associated with the recharging and production operation in a representative EGS geothermal field can be foreseen and predicted in a quantitative way.","Sinotech Engn Consultants Inc, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,5,1.0,0.0,"Yang, CH (corresponding author), Sinotech Engn Consultants Inc, Taipei, Taiwan.",,,Scenarios analysis; I-lan geothermal site; TOUGH2-EGS; Heat production scenario,10.1016/j.geothermics.2018.05.003,Article,,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,GEOTHERMICS,1,75,ISI,SINOTECH ENGN CONSULTANTS INC;NATL TAIWAN UNIV,SINOTECH ENGN CONSULTANTS INC,B2

2019.0,Geothermics,Using a 1D numerical temperature recovery model to estimate insitu thermal diffusivity by an upwelling heat source in an artesian well,Chang C;Hsu N;Chen W,"The determination of thermal diffusivity is a pre-requisite for geothermal site characterization and utilization. The temperature recovery (TR) method is a popular method for determining in-situ thermal conductivity together with the thermal response test and thermal conductivity probe methods. To determine in-situ thermal properties of the subsurface following a thermal disturbance produced by drilling processes or a heating cable within a borehole, the TR method is used to record decaying temperatures during the recovery period. However, to date, no studies exist to determine thermal diffusivity using up-welling water within a well. In this study, we introduce a 1D numerical method for estimating in-situ thermal diffusivity of the subsurface using up-welling thermal water as a heat source within an artesian well. Our numerical model includes parameters for the position of a sensor within a borehole, as well as for the thermal properties of a well casing and an annulus. Two data sets from the scientific literature were used to verify our model. Field data from the Jiashi Hot Spring in Taiwan were also used to demonstrate model suitability. Our model's value for thermal conductivity is consistent with the range of values for saturated sand within the scientific literature. Accuracies for thermal diffusivity estimations under short disturbance/recovery period were also evaluated. The results suggest that in-situ thermal diffusivity can be accurate determined, with an error less than 10%, using a short testing period with pumping time as low as four hours and a recovery of 24 h.","Water Resources Agcy, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Chia Nan Univ & Sci, Inst Hot Spring Ind, Tainan, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,1.0,"Chen, WF (corresponding author), Chia Nan Univ & Sci, Inst Hot Spring Ind, Tainan, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and Technology of TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan; Water Resources Agency; Central Geological Survey, Ministry of Economic Affairs","We thank the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan, the Water Resources Agency, and the Central Geological Survey, Ministry of Economic Affairs, for research funding and support.",Temperature recovery; In-situ thermal diffusivity; Artesian,10.1016/j.geothermics.2019.05.002,Article,RESPONSE TEST,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,GEOTHERMICS,0,81,ISI,WATER RESOURCES AGCY;NATL TAIWAN UNIV;CHIA NAN UNIV AND SCI,CHIA NAN UNIV AND SCI,B2

Long-term chemical and isotope data from the production wells have been analyzed since 1973, and the rising steam ratio and enthalpy indicate that shortages of recharging fluids lead to a serious boiling and scaling of carbonates within the first few years of production. Furthermore, the progressively depleted hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios and the high chloride concentrations in the southern part of the reservoir after discharge indicate that the hot fluids may have been derived from high altitudes and circulated through a deep layer during the discharge period. Decreasing chloride concentrations, lowered silica temperatures, and enriched hydrogen isotope values in the northern part of the reservoir indicate that there is a shallower meteoric fluid circulation from another fractured system that has seeped into and discharged the reservoir when the pressure of the main conduit dropped. After a long non-discharging period, the isotope values are enriched, the concentration of chloride is halved, and silica temperatures are lower than initially state. These observations indicate that the reservoir after the pressure drop was recharged by a shallower meteoric fluid, but the residence time is too short for heating to the initial condition.","Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Jie Yuan Technol Co Ltd, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Fukuoka Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Fukuoka, Japan.;  Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Soil & Environm Sci, Taichung, Taiwan.;  Natl Ctr Res Earthquake Engn, Taipei, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;JAPAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,8,1.0,1.0,"Song, SR (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 103-3113-M-002-001, MOST 104-3113-M-002-001, MOST 105-3113-M-002-001]","This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Taiwan [MOST 103-3113-M-002-001, MOST 104-3113-M-002-001, and MOST 105-3113-M-002-001].

2021.0,Geothermics,Fluid flow and faultrelated subsurface fractures in slate and metasandstone formations A case study of the Jentse Geothermal Area Taiwan,Chen B;Perdana T;Kuo L,"Permeable structures associated with faults are commonly treated as geothermal fluid conduits in most tight geothermal reservoirs. However, the properties of permeable structures within fault zones remain unclear due to the lack of subsurface geological data, e.g., the geothermal systems in the tight slate and metasandstone formations in Northeastern Taiwan. This study presented standard open-hole and Fullbore Formation MicroImager (FMI) logs acquired in the 8.5-inch-diameter section of the JT-3 well (800-1475 m measured depth) in the Jentse geothermal area, Taiwan, to identify the subsurface fracture structures and the possible pathway of fluid flow. Using open-hole log data, we generate a lithology interpretation for the borehole and model the associated effective porosity. Based on the FMI images, four types of natural open fractures, two types of natural sealed fractures, and drilling-induced tensile fractures were identified. Integration of the lithological model, the effective porosity, and the types of fractures reveals one major permeable fault system comprising three permeable fault zones. The fault system is composed of both permeable fault cores marked by porous fault breccia and damage zones characterized by a large number of open-fracture planes. The static borehole temperature log also shows deflections in these interpreted permeable fractures zone. Deflections in these fracture zones that, based on petrophysical and borehole image logs, are interpreted as permeable. According to the orientations of the bed boundaries and fault planes obtained from FMI images, the fault system may have an orientation of N50-70 degrees E and dips 70-90 degrees to the NW with a width of around 116 m. This study illustrates how subsurface structures control geothermal conduits. The concept and workflow of this study may be useful for other fault-controlled geothermal areas in Taiwan.","Natl Cent Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Taoyuan, Taiwan.;  CPC Corp Taiwan, Explorat & Prod Business Div, Taipei, Taiwan.;  GeothermEx Inc, Richmond, CA USA.;  Natl Cent Univ, Earthquake Disaster & Risk Evaluat & Management C, Taoyuan, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;USA;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,1.0,"Kuo, LW (corresponding author), 300 JhongDa Rd, Taoyuan 32001, Taiwan.","Taiwan ROC (Republic of China) Ministry of Science and Technology [MOST 108-2116-M-008-021-MY2]; Earthquake-Disaster & Risk Evaluation and Management Center, ""EDREaM""; Ministry of Education (MOE)Ministry of Education, Singapore","This research used materials and software provided by the Exploration & Production Business Division, CPC Corporation Taiwan.

2021.0,Geothermics,Geothermal energy development roadmap of Taiwan by play fairway analysis,Wang Y;Lo W;Song S;Wu M,"Following the 2015 Paris Agreement dealing with the mitigation of global warming, the government and people of Taiwan have expressed their environmental awareness by accelerating the ongoing effort of substituting fossil fuel power with green energy forms. With the deadline for promised energy policies approaching, more action is required of the geothermal option despite its high exploration cost and uncertainty issues. The Play Fairway Analysis (PFA) is an excellent low-cost decision-making tool with a quantitative approach and the capability to combine multiple factors from limited data sources and provide stakeholders a probability assessment in the early stage of the geothermal exploration. It can construct a prudent development roadmap combining geological elements alongside socioeconomic data in place. Considering the local aspects of the geological setting in metamorphic rocks and an active orogenic mountain belt uplift environment, the study adapts the PFA methodology using relevant data in geochemistry, geophysics, and geographies to depict the key geothermal factors in heat sources and fractural pathways. Existing elements available for analysis include (1) temperature of hot springs, silica geothermometry, and surface uplift rates for heat sources, and (2) active fault lines, shallow micro-earthquakes, dilatation strain rates, and elevation variation for fractural pathway. For pragmatic consideration, we choose population density and national parks to represent added human factors in this study to cover constrains such as operating cost, supply needs, regulations, and the like. Through normalizing and weighting processes from the ArcGIS platform, the resulting composite map, confirmed with previous research reports, displays the calculated values on each grid cell over the research area in an easy-to-read format. We present three suggested prospects labelled in this realistic map of potential geothermal distribution across Taiwan as candidates for the next phase of geothermal development projects as part of the long push to achieve our nation's green energy goals.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, 1,Sec 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.;  Natl Taipei Univ Technol, Inst Mineral Resources Engn, 1,Sec 3,Zhongxiao E Rd, Taipei 10608, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,4,1.0,1.0,"Lo, W (corresponding author), Natl Taipei Univ Technol, Inst Mineral Resources Engn, 1,Sec 3,Zhongxiao E Rd, Taipei 10608, Taiwan.",,,Play fairway; Geothermal energy; Human factor; Geothermal exploration; Taiwan,10.1016/j.geothermics.2021.102242,Article,ARC-CONTINENT COLLISION; EXPLORATION; POPULATION; RESOURCES; EVOLUTION; SYSTEM; AREA; RISK,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,GEOTHERMICS,0,97,ISI,NATL TAIWAN UNIV;NATL TAIPEI UNIV TECHNOL,NATL TAIPEI UNIV TECHNOL,B1

An east-west extending magma-like body caused by the westward of the Okinawa Trough had been revealed from seismic and geomagnetic studies. Two geological models have been suggested as an extensional strike-slip fault and normal fault models for the deep geothermal field in NE Taiwan. The difference of the main fault in the two geology models is the active normal strike-slip fault or inactive thrust fault and its dip directions. We investigated the electrical resistivity structure beneath the Ilan Plain using audio-magnetotelluric data to delineate the location of its geothermal reservoirs. The 3D electrical resistivity model is highly correlated with the normal fault model. The electrical resistivity model shows that the high conductivity anomaly distributes in the depths of 500-1,100 m south of the drilled geothermal observation wells. We correlate the anomalous high conductor with the reservoir and it could be controlled by the Chuoshui Fault and the Chukeng Fault.

2021.0,Geothermics,The GTFSampler A new downhole equipment for geothermal fluid sampling and its testing results in the Chingshiu geothermal field Ilan Taiwan,Hsieh P;Lin C;Chang Y;Lu H;Yang T,"A new downhole sampler, GTFSampler, is designed to collect in-situ geothermal fluids and preserve the conditions of the sampling depth. The GTFSampler is mainly composed of a stainless sampling cylinder and a gas driven shut-in valve, which are hosted in an equipment protector. The sampler assembly connects to a stainless tube for hoisting in a borehole and switching the shut-in valve by changing the inner pressure of the stainless tube on surface. Selected gas (e.g., N-2 or noble gas) is pre-filled to the sampling cylinder at a fixed pressure before sampling. The GTFSampler is also equipped with a traditional mercury maximum thermometer. The comparison between the measured temperature and calculated thermodynamic equilibrium temperature from saturation degree of minerals is used to verify the representativeness of downhole sample collection, on-site sample separation and laboratory analysis. In the borehole IC-19 deployment in Chingshui geothermal field, Ilan, Taiwan, the measured temperature at 800 m are ca. 190 similar to 198 degrees C. Three downhole samplings were conducted in this study, i.e., the first and second samplings were deployed in discharged borehole condition and the third sampling in closed borehole condition. The first and second samplings showed that the theoretical equilibrium temperature calculated by geochemical modeling from fluid composition is very close to the measured temperature at the sampling depth. However, no convergence solution for equilibrium temperature is obtained for the third sampling, indicating certain interference in geothermal water quality by the natural convection inside the borehole as the control valve is closed. In summary, the GTFSampler and its corresponding sampling procedures successfully collect the downhole geothermal fluids.","Ind Technol Res Inst, Mat & Chem Res Labs, Rm 284,Bldg 22-1,195,Sec 4,Chung Hsing Rd, Hsinchu 31040, Taiwan.;  Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, 168,Sec 1,Univ Rd, Chiayi 62102, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, 1,Sec 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,5,1.0,1.0,"Hsieh, PS (corresponding author), Ind Technol Res Inst, Mat & Chem Res Labs, Dept Potential Host Rock Characterizat Res, Rm 284,Bldg 22-1,195,Sec 4,Chung Hsing Rd, Hsinchu 31040, Taiwan.","Bureau of Energy, Ministry of Economic Affairs, TaiwanMinistry of Economic Affairs, Taiwan","We are grateful to YuChen Cheng (Department of Geosciences, National Taiwan University) , JinLun Chuang (Department of Geosciences, National Taiwan University) , and ShihChi Engineering Co.

2016.0,Gondwana Res.,Topographic architecture and drainage reorganization in Southeast China Zircon UPb chronology and Hf isotope evidence from Taiwan,Lan Q;Yan Y;Huang C;Santosh M;Shan Y;Chen W;Yu M;Qian K,"The uplift of Tibet Plateau and the marginal sea spreading have had important influence on the tectonic, landform and drainage system in East Asia, although the marginal sea spreading in shaping the topography and drainage reorganization in East Asia has been still controversial. Here we present U-Pb age and Hf isotopic composition of detrital zircon grains from Cenozoic sedimentary rocks in Taiwan to understand how the provenance and river systems evolved. Our data show that the U-Pb age spectra of detrital zircon grains in Paleogene sandstones are dominated by Yanshanian (180-67 Ma) zircon grains and with subordinate or nil Proterozoic and Archean zircon grains. These results are in contrast to those in Miocene rocks that are dominated by the Indosinian (257-205 Ma) zircon grains together with Yanshanian, Proterozoic and Archean population. The initial Hf isotope ratios [epsilon Hf(t)] of the zircon grains also display systematic change in Paleogene and Neogene strata. Our data demonstrate that the Hsuehshan Range and Western Foothills in Taiwan have the same sedimentary sources. The source region of Paleogene strata was mainly located at the coast in southeast China and migrated inland over time. The source might have reached the Lower Yangtze region during early Miocene. Although the mechanism of transport of sediments from the Lower Yangtze region to Taiwan is unclear, we speculate that the Minjiang River might have been larger in Early Miocene than the present and might have delivered inland material along the boundary of Yangtze and Cathaysia Blocks to Taiwan. These were then captured by the Yangtze River systems at some time after Late Miocene. This change corresponds to the time of the drainage reorganization in East Tibet, such as Yangtze River, and the regional subsidence resulting from the opening of marginal sea. The combined effects of Tibet uplift and opening of marginal sea might have shaped the topography and river system reorganization in East Tibet. The evolution of topography and drainage systems in southeast China seems to be mainly controlled by the opening of marginal sea. (C) 2015 International Association for Gondwana Research.

2010.0,GPS Solut.,Impact of FORMOSAT3COSMIC GPS radio occultation and dropwindsonde data on regional model predictions during the 2007 Meiyu season,Chien F;Kuo Y,"A study of the impact of FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC GPS radio occultation (RO) and dropwindsonde data on regional model simulations for a 11-day period during the 2007 Mei-yu season is presented. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and its three-dimensional variation component, WRF-Var, are used for regional model predictions of heavy rainfall events in Taiwan. Without the use of GPS RO and dropwindsonde data, pressure and relative humidity are, in general, underestimated by the model; temperature predictions have a warm bias at the low level and a cold bias at the high level; and the east-west and north-south component winds have positive and negative biases, respectively. Incorporating GPS RO data tends to improve the prediction for longer integration. The assimilation of dropwindsonde data improves the forecast at the earlier time and at higher levels, and the improvement decreases over time. The reason the dropwindsonde data produce a positive impact earlier and the GPS RO data later is that there are few GPS RO observations in the fine domain. The large-scale simulation is first improved using the GPS RO observations, and the resulting changes can have a positive impact on the mesoscale at the later time. The dropwindsonde observations were taken inside the fine domain such that their impact can be detected early in the simulation. With both types of observation included, the prediction shows even greater improvement. At the earlier forecast time, there is nearly no impact from GPS and dropwindsonde data on rainfall forecasts. However, at the later integration time, the GPS data start to significantly improve the rainfall forecast. The dropwindsonde data also provide a positive impact on rainfall forecasts, but it is not as significant as that of the GPS data.","Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Taipei 116, Taiwan.;  Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Mesoscale & Microscale Meteorol Div, Boulder, CO 80307 USA.;",TAIWAN;USA,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,,"Chien, FC (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Earth Sci, 88,Sect 4,Ting Chou Rd, Taipei 116, Taiwan.","National Space Organization (NSPO) of Taiwan [96-NSPO(B)-SP-FA0703(D)]; National Science Council of TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [NSC 95-2625-Z-003-001, NSC 95-2111-M-003-001-AP2]","This research was supported by the National Space Organization (NSPO) of Taiwan under Grand 96-NSPO(B)-SP-FA0703(D) and the National Science Council of Taiwan (Grants NSC 95-2625-Z-003-001 and NSC 95-2111-M-003-001-AP2).

2010.0,GPS Solut.,Impact of GPS radio occultation data assimilation on regional weather predictions,Huang C;Kuo Y;Chen S;Terng C;Chien F;Lin P;Kueh M;Chen S;Yang M;Wang C;Rao A,"The impact of GPS radio occultation (RO) data assimilation on severe weather predictions in East Asia is introduced and reviewed. Both the local observation operator that assimilates the retrieved refractivity as local point measurement, and the nonlocal observation operator that assimilates the integrated retrieved refractivity along a straight raypath have been utilized in WRF 3DVAR to improve the initial analysis of the model. A general evaluation of the impact of these approaches on Asian regional analysis and daily prediction is provided in this paper. In general, the GPS RO data assimilation may improve prediction of severe weather such as typhoons and Mei-yu systems when COSMIC data were available, ranging from several points in 2006 to a maximum of about 60 in 2007 and 2008 in this region. Based on a number of experiments, regional model predictions at 5 km resolution were not significantly influenced by different observation operators, although the nonlocal observation operator sometimes results in slightly better track forecast. These positive impacts are seen not only in typhoon track prediction but also in prediction of local heavy rainfall associated with severe weather over Taiwan. The impact of 56 GPS RO soundings on track prediction of Cyclone Gonu (2007) over the Indian Ocean is also appealing when compared to other tracks assimilated with different observations. From a successive evaluation of skill scores for real-time forecasts on Mei-yu frontal systems operationally conducted over a longer period and predictions of six typhoons in 2008, assimilation of GPS RO data appears to have some positive impact on regional weather predictions, on top of existent assimilation with all other observations.","Natl Cent Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Jhongli, Taiwan.;  Univ Corp Atmospher Res, COSMIC Project, Boulder, CO USA.;  Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Mesoscale Predict Grp, MMM Div, Boulder, CO 80307 USA.;  Cent Weather Bur, Meteorol Informat Ctr, Minist Transportat & Commun, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Univ Calif Davis, Dept Land Air & Water Resources, Davis, CA 95616 USA.;  Cent Weather Bur, Numer Weather Forecast Meteorol Informat Ctr, Minist Transportat & Commun, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Cent Weather Bur, Marine Meteorol Ctr, Minist Transportat & Commun, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Natl Cent Univ, Inst Hydrol Sci, Jhongli, Taiwan.;  Natl Cent Univ, Inst Atmospher Phys, Coll Earth Sci, Jhongli, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;USA;USA;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;USA;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,11,1.0,,"Huang, CY (corresponding author), Natl Cent Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Jhongli, Taiwan.","National Science Council (NSC)Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan; National Space Program Organization (NSPO) in Taiwan","This study was supported by the National Science Council (NSC) and the National Space Program Organization (NSPO) in Taiwan.

C/A code pseudoranges have been observed at three International GPS Service reference stations that are representative of mid-latitude (BOR1 and IRKJ) and low-latitude (TWTF) regions of the ionosphere. The observations took place during 27 geomagnetically quiet days from April 2010 to October 2011. We perform separate solutions using the TWIM, KLOB, GIM ionospheric models and carry out a solution applying no ionospheric correction at all. We compute the daily mean horizontal errors (DMEAN) and the daily RMS (DRMS) for these solutions with respect to the published reference station coordinates. It has demonstrated that TEC maps generate using the TWIM exhibit a detailed structure of the ionosphere, particularly at low-latitude region, whereas the Klobuchar and the GIM only provide the basic diurnal and geographic features of the ionosphere. Also, it is shown that even for lower satellite elevations, the TWIM provides better positioning than the Klobuchar and GIM models. Specifically, using TWIM, the difference of the uncorrected solution (no ionospheric correction), and the other solutions, relative to the uncorrected solution, is 45 % for the mean horizontal error (DMEAN) and 42 % for the horizontal root-mean-square error (DRMS). Using Klobuchar and GIM, the percent for DMEAN only reaches to about 12 % and 3 %, while the values for the DRMS are only 12 and 4 %, respectively. In the vertical direction, all models have a percentage of about 99 and 70 % for the mean vertical error (VMEAN) and vertical root-mean-square error (VRMS), respectively. These percentages show the greater impact of TWIM on the ionospheric correction compared to the other models. In at least 40 % of the observed days and across all stations, TWIM has the smallest DMEAN, VMEAN, DRMS, and VRMS daily values. These values reach 100 % at station TWTF. This shows the overall performance of TWIM is better than the Klobuchar and GIM.","Natl Cent Univ, Inst Space Sci, Chungli 32054, Taiwan.;  Natl Cent Univ, Ctr Space & Remote Sensing Res, Chungli 32054, Taiwan.;  Acad Sinica, Inst Astron & Astrophys, Taipei 115, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,4,1.0,,"Macalalad, EP (corresponding author), Natl Cent Univ, Inst Space Sci, Chungli 32054, Taiwan.",,,Single-frequency GPS positioning; Ionospheric model; Ionospheric delay,10.1007/s10291-012-0282-8,Article,,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,GPS SOLUTIONS,14,17,ISI,NATL CENT UNIV;NATL CENT UNIV;INST ASTRON AND ASTROPHYS,NATL CENT UNIV,A
2014.0,GPS Solut.,GPSGalileo long baseline computation method and performance analyses,Chu F;Yang M,"Modernized GPS and Galileo will provide triple-frequency signals for civil use, generating a high interest to examine the improvement of positioning performance using the triple-frequency signals from both constellations over baselines up to hundreds or thousands of kilometers. This study adopts a generalized GPS/Galileo long-range approach to process the mutually compatible GPS and Galileo triple-frequency measurements for high-precision long baseline determination. The generalized approach has the flexibility to deal with GPS and Galileo constellations separately or jointly, and also the capability to handle dual or triple-frequency measurements. We compared the generalized long-range approach with the Bernese v5.0 software on two test baselines located in East Asia and obtained highly compatible computational results. Further, in order to assess possible improvement of GPS/Galileo long baseline determination compared with the current dual-frequency (L1/L2) GPS, we simulated GPS and Galileo measurements of the test baselines. It is shown that the current level of accuracy of daily baseline solutions can be improved by using the additional Galileo constellation. Both the additional constellation and the triple-frequency measurements can improve ambiguity resolution performance, but single-constellation triple-frequency ambiguity resolution is more resistant to the influences of code noise and multipath than dual-constellation dual-frequency ambiguity resolution. Therefore, in environments where large code noise or multipath is present, the use of triple-frequency measurements is the main factor for improving ambiguity resolution performance.","Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Geomat, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,,"Yang, M (corresponding author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Geomat, 1 Univ Rd, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.","National Land Surveying and Mapping Center [NLSC-97-46]; National Science Council of TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [101-2221-E-006-179-MY3]",The authors are indebted to the National Land Surveying and Mapping Center (Grant No. NLSC-97-46) and National Science Council (Grant No. 101-2221-E-006-179-MY3) of Taiwan for their support.,Global positioning system; Galileo; Long baseline computation; Performance analyses; Ambiguity resolution,10.1007/s10291-013-0327-7,Article,AMBIGUITY RESOLUTION; GPS; GALILEO; MAINTENANCE; TAIWAN,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,GPS SOLUTIONS,17,18,ISI,NATL CHENG KUNG UNIV,NATL CHENG KUNG UNIV,A
2016.0,GPS Solut.,Performance evaluation of different ionospheric models in singlefrequency codebased differential GPS positioning,Macalalad E;Tsai L;Wu J,"Differential ionospheric slant delays are obtained from a quiet-time, three-dimensional ionospheric electron density model, called the TaiWan Ionosphere Model (TWIM), to be used in code-based differential GPS positioning. The code observations are acquired from nine continuously operating GPS stations around Taiwan whose baseline ranged from 19 to 340 km. Daily 24-hour epoch-per-epoch positioning obtained for 70 most geomagnetic quiet days (2008-2010) for each of the 72 baselines. The performance of TWIM has been compared with the standard operational Klobuchar model (KLB) used by typical single-frequency receivers and the IGS global ionospheric model (GIM). Generally, TWIM performed well in reducing the differential ionospheric delay especially for long baselines and different levels of low solar activity. It has a much better performance compared to the operational KLB model. TWIM also performed similarly with GIM, though GIM has the best performance overall. GIM has the best ionospheric gradient estimates among the three models whose differential ionospheric delay-to-horizontal error ratio is more than 0.25. This is followed closely by TWIM with about 0.20. KLB only has a ratio of < 0.10. The similarity of the performance of TWIM and GIM demonstrates the feasibility of TWIM in correcting for differential ionospheric delays in the C/A code pseudorange that is caused by electron density gradients in the ionosphere. It can provide decimeter-to-centimeter level accuracy in differential GPS positioning for single-frequency receivers during geomagnetic quiet conditions across all seasons and different levels of low solar activities.","Natl Cent Univ, Inst Space Sci, Chungli 32054, Taiwan.;  Natl Cent Univ, Ctr Space & Remote Sensing Res, Chungli 32054, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,,"Macalalad, EP (corresponding author), Natl Cent Univ, Inst Space Sci, Chungli 32054, Taiwan.","National Science CouncilMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [NSC102-2111-M008-028, NSC102-2111-M008-029]","This research was supported in part by the National Science Council under Grants NSC102-2111-M008-028 and NSC102-2111-M008-029.

2016.0,GPS Solut.,Widearea ionospheric delay model for GNSS users in middle and lowmagneticlatitude regions,Tao A;Jan S,"A useful ionospheric delay model to compensate for the effect of ionospheric error on GNSS service over continent-wide areas or oceans is the Satellite-Based Augmentation System's wide-area thin-shell planar fit ionospheric grid model. In order to implement a proper wide-area ionospheric delay model in the Asia-Pacific region to reflect the variation introduced by local ionospheric activity, the present study develops a proper ionospheric delay model to correct ionospheric error in middle- and low-magnetic-latitude regions. Specifically, the proposed ionospheric delay model uses several dual-frequency GNSS reference stations distributed in Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, and China as grid points in place of the conventional grid points generated by ionospheric pierce points. The ionospheric delays observed at the reference stations are processed and provided to the user, who can then construct the ionospheric delay model using weighted least squares with the distances between the user and the stations as weights. This proposed ionospheric delay model lowers the computation load by eliminating the conversion of delays at the ionospheric pierce points to those at the grid points and provides good descriptions of dynamic variations due to the ionospheric activities. Also, a simplified model is developed to further reduce its computation load while providing almost the same service as that of the original proposed model. A selection mechanism between the original proposed model and its simplified version is developed as well. The details of the proposed ionospheric delay model are explained, and experiments conducted using data collected from the reference stations in the Asia-Pacific region are presented. The effectiveness of the proposed model is validated by comparison with the conventional wide-area thin-shell planar fit ionospheric grid model provided by the Japanese Multi-functional Satellite Augmentation System under both nominal and disturbed ionospheric conditions.","Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Aeronaut & Astronaut, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,,"Jan, SS (corresponding author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Aeronaut & Astronaut, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.","College of Engineering at National Cheng Kung University; National Science Council of TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [NSC 101-2628-E-006-013-MY3]",This work was supported by the College of Engineering at National Cheng Kung University and the National Science Council of Taiwan under Grant NSC 101-2628-E-006-013-MY3.

A system used to construct the global total electron content (TEC) distribution for monitoring the ionospheric weather in near-real time is needed in the modern society. Here we build the TEC map named Taiwan Ionosphere Group for Education and Research (TIGER) Global Ionospheric Map (GIM) from observations of ground-based GNSS receivers and space-based FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC (F3/C) GPS radio occultation observations using the spherical harmonic expansion and Kalman filter update formula. The TIGER GIM (TGIM) will be published in near-real time of 4-h delay with a spatial resolution of 2.5 degrees in latitude and 5 degrees in longitude and a high temporal resolution of every 5 min. The F3/C TEC results in an improvement on the GIM of about 15.5%, especially over the ocean areas. The TGIM highly correlates with the GIMs published by other international organizations. Therefore, the routinely published TGIM in near-real time is not only for communication, positioning, and navigation applications but also for monitoring and scientific study of ionospheric weathers, such as magnetic storms and seismo-ionospheric anomalies.","Natl Cent Univ, Grad Inst Space Sci, Taoyuan, Taiwan.;  Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Tainan, Taiwan.;  Univ Warmia & Mazury, Space Radiodiagnost Res Ctr, Olsztyn, Poland.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;POLAND,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,4,1.0,,"Liu, JY (corresponding author), Natl Cent Univ, Grad Inst Space Sci, Taoyuan, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and TechnologyMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [MOST 104-2628-M-008-001, MOST 105-2111-M-006-004]; ISSI-Bern International Team of ""Ionospheric Space Weather Studied by RO and Ground-based GNSS TEC Observations''","This study is supported by the grant of Ministry of Science and Technology to National Central University, MOST 104-2628-M-008-001, to National Cheng Kung University, MOST 105-2111-M-006-004, and the ISSI-Bern International Team of ""Ionospheric Space Weather Studied by RO and Ground-based GNSS TEC Observations'' (the team leader Liu J.

2018.0,GPS Solut.,Determination of near realtime GNSS satellite clocks for the FORMOSAT7COSMIC2 satellite mission,Tseng T;Chen S;Chen K;Huang C;Yeh W,"In this study, we determine the near real-time (NRT) clocks of the Global Positioning System (GPS) and Globalnaya Navi-gatsionnaya Sputnikovaya Sistema (GLONASS) satellites in the Taiwan RO Process System (TROPS), which is mainly designed for the data processing in both the FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC (F3C) and FORMOSAT-7/COSMIC-2 (F7C2) satellite missions. The accuracy of GNSS clocks defines the quality of the atmospheric excess phase, which is used for the retrieval of bending angle profiles in GNSS radio occultation (RO) observations. The accuracy of the NRT GNSS clocks is assessed by comparing the clock rate, clock stability and clock-induced positioning error on receivers with the final solutions given by the European Space Agency (ESA). Overall, the standard deviations of the clock rates from TROPS agree with those from ESA within 0.05 mm/s over 2304 clock solutions. Additionally, we find that the clock stability of the GPS Block IIF type (3 x 10(-13)) is an order of magnitude better than that of IIR Block types (3 x 10(-12)) over a time interval of 30 s. In comparison, the stabilities of GLONASS clocks are approximately 3 x 10(-12). We quantify the NRT clock error on the receiver positioning by using the precise point positioning technique obtained from the Bernese GNSS software. The 3-dimensional clock-induced positioning error is approximately 3.3, 3.2 and 0.9 cm for station AUCK and 6.9, 6.3 and 3.1 cm for station NRC1 for the GPS-only, GLONASS-only and GPS + GLONASS cases, respectively. For GNSS-RO applications, the bending angle profiles derived using TROPS GPS clocks agree with the COSMIC Data Analysis and Archive Center products to within 0.01-1.00 mu rad. However, this is not the case for the GLONASS clock, because the GLONASS clock-induced errors on the RO profile are 10-100 times greater than those induced by the GPS clock. This suggests that different weightings should be used for RO applications, such as data assimilation, when different satellite clocks are involved in GNSS-RO retrievals. This study serves as a reference for assessing the impact of GNSS clocks on both GNSS-POD (precise orbit determination) and GNSS-RO in preparation for the F7C2 satellite mission.","Natl Cent Univ, GPS Sci & Applicat Res Ctr, 300 Jhongda Rd, Jhongli 32001, Taiwan.;  Cooperat Res Ctr Spatial Informat, Level 5,204 Lygon St, Carlton, Vic 3053, Australia.;  Geosci Australia, Jerrabomberra Ave & Hindmarsh Dr, Symonston, ACT 2609, Australia.;  Natl Space Org, 8F,9 Prosper 1st Rd, Hsinchu 30078, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;AUSTRALIA;AUSTRALIA;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,AUSTRALIA,5,1.0,,"Tseng, TP (corresponding author), Natl Cent Univ, GPS Sci & Applicat Res Ctr, 300 Jhongda Rd, Jhongli 32001, Taiwan.; Tseng, TP (corresponding author), Cooperat Res Ctr Spatial Informat, Level 5,204 Lygon St, Carlton, Vic 3053, Australia.; Tseng, TP (corresponding author), Geosci Australia, Jerrabomberra Ave & Hindmarsh Dr, Symonston, ACT 2609, Australia.","TACC team in Taiwan CWB [F3C, F7C2]; [NSPO-S-102024]; [NSPO-S-103039]; [NSPO-S-105049]; [NSPO-S-105058]","This study is funded by projects under grant numbers NSPO-S-102024, NSPO-S-103039, NSPO-S-105049 and NSPO-S-105058.

We designed and implemented an appropriate software receiver to acquire and track GPS-R L1-band C/A code signals in near real time. At Lanyu, Taiwan, a research platform has been built with two software-based GPS-R receivers overlooking the seas in the east-northeast and southwest directions. Additionally, we propose applying the maximum entropy method for the spectral analyses of recorded time series of GPS-R signal acquisition data and derive the mean frequencies, periods, and speeds of random sea-surface waves. The derived sea-surface wave frequencies have been compared and validated against buoy measurements and Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model data around Lanyu Island. The results show that the buoy wave heights and the modeled WRF wave heights have linear correlation coefficients of 0.64 and 0.47, respectively, with the GPS-R wave frequency measurements. The observed coastal sea area has a maximum horizontal distance of approximately 20 km from station Lanyu (22.037 degrees N, 121.559 degrees E). Thus, the corresponding mapping products of the sea-surface wave period and speed are presented with wave propagation footprints of the first Fresnel zone sizes.","Natl Cent Univ NCU, GPS Sci & Applicat Res Ctr, Chungli, Taiwan.;  NCU, Ctr Space & Remote Sensing Res, Chungli, Taiwan.;  NCU, Grad Inst Hydrol & Ocean Sci, Chungli, Taiwan.;  Acad Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Tech Univ Berlin, Inst Geodesy & Geoinformat Sci, Berlin, Germany.;  Helmholtz Ctr Potsdam, German Res Ctr Geosci GFZ, Potsdam, Germany.;  K N Toosi Univ Technol, Dept Geodesy & Geomat Eng, Tehran, Iran.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;GERMANY;GERMANY;IRAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,7,1.0,,"Tsai, LC (corresponding author), Natl Cent Univ NCU, GPS Sci & Applicat Res Ctr, Chungli, Taiwan.; Tsai, LC (corresponding author), NCU, Ctr Space & Remote Sensing Res, Chungli, Taiwan.","MOST from the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, R.O.C.

2010.0,Holocene,Pollen records from southern Taiwan implications for East Asian summer monsoon variation during the Holocene,Lee C;Liew P;Lee T,"Pollen records from two cores retrieved from a valley basin in southern Taiwan show major changes in vegetation and climate occurring during the Holocene. Between 11 400 and 8200 cal. yr BP, the uplands surrounding this valley were dominated by the highland forest components of Maesa, Ardisia, Castanopsis, Cyclobalanopsis, Deutzia, Hydrangea, Ligustrum and Carpinus, which indicates the period was cooler than present. An increase in lowland forest components, such as Aglaia, Phoenix, Calamus, Glochidion and Schefflera, between 8200 and 4100 cal. yr BP, indicates a warmer period than present. It also marks the Holocene thermal optimum. The basin experienced cool climate conditions during the interval 4100 to 2100 cal. yr BP, evidenced by a decrease in lowland forest components. Finally, the climate became warm again from 2100 cal. yr BP, which is analogous to the climate conditions there today. We also identify four submillennial climate phases from pollen assemblages and swamp facies. Highland forest components increased in relative abundance, while the entire valley hosted a herb-dominant swamp, suggesting that the water-table was lower and the climate was cooler. We assert that the East Asian summer monsoon was weaker during these periods (10 600-10 300 cal. yr BP, 9400-8600 cal. yr BP, 7300-7000 cal. yr BP and 5700-5200 cal. yr BP).","Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei 107, Taiwan.;  Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei 115, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,0.0,"Lee, CY (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei 107, Taiwan.",,,Holocene; pollen record; East Asian monsoon; climate change; peat layers; Cyperaceae,10.1177/0959683609348859,Article,HIGH-RESOLUTION; ATLANTIC CLIMATE; LATE PLEISTOCENE; WESTERN PART; ICE-CORE; CHINA; RECONSTRUCTION; VEGETATION; HISTORY; EVENTS,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,HOLOCENE,29,20,ISI,NATL TAIWAN UNIV;INST EARTH SCI,NATL TAIWAN UNIV,B2

Robust paleoclimate reconstructions in East Asia are complicated by multiple sources of precipitation. These sources, such as the EAWM and typhoons, need to be disentangled in order to understand the dominant source of precipitation influencing the past and current climate. Taiwan, situated within the subtropical East Asian monsoon system, provides a unique opportunity to study monsoon and typhoon variability through time. Here we combine sediment trap data with down-core records from Cueifong Lake in northeastern Taiwan to reconstruct monsoonal rainfall fluctuations over the past 3000 years. The monthly collected grain-size data indicate that a decrease in sediment grain size reflects the strength of the EAWM. End member modelling analysis (EMMA) on sediment core and trap data reveals two dominant grain-size end-members (EMs), with the coarse EM 2 representing a robust indicator of EAWM strength. The downcore variations of EM 2 show a gradual decrease over the past 3000 years indicating a gradual strengthening of the EAWM, in agreement with other published EAWM records. This enhanced late-Holocene EAWM can be linked to the expansion of sea-ice cover in the western Arctic Ocean caused by decreased summer insolation.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Univ Potsdam, Inst Geosci, Potsdam, Germany.;  Univ Birmingham, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.;  Heidelberg Univ, Inst Earth Sci, Heidelberg, Germany.;  Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Oceanog, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.;  Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, Polar Terr Environm Syst, Bremerhaven, Germany.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Bioenvironm Syst Engn, Taipei, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;GERMANY;UNITED KINGDOM;GERMANY;TAIWAN;GERMANY;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,11,1.0,1.0,"Lowemark, L (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and Technology (Taiwan)Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [109-2927-I-002-508]; Featured Areas Research Center Program within the framework of the Higher Education Sprout Project by the Ministry of Education (MOE) of Taiwan; German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD) [57558354]; University of Potsdam","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology (Taiwan) (grant numbers 109-2927-I-002-508) and the Featured Areas Research Center Program within the framework of the Higher Education Sprout Project by the Ministry of Education (MOE) of Taiwan.

Over-pumping of groundwaters, due to booming freshwater aquaculture and agricultural activity, has caused the groundwater level to fall and land to subside below sea level in some coastal areas. Isotopic and chemical groundwater analysis has verified the deterioration in coastal groundwater quality, due to active seawater intrusion through the offshore outcrops of both unconfined and confined aquifers, since 1980. The greatest extent of seawater encroachment has been estimated to be as far as 8.5 km inland with an affected area of about 104 km2 for the deep confined aquifer in 1996. Remedial measures need to be immediately enforced to effectively restrain sea water encroachment and to alleviate groundwater salinization.","Institute of Earth Sciences, Academia Sinica, PO Box 1-55, Nankang, Taipei, 11529, Taiwan; Central Geological Survey, PO Box 968, Taipei, 23557, Taiwan; Dept. of Soil and Environ.

2003.0,IAHS-AISH Publ.,Did sulfurrich volcanic eruptions affect drought episodes in Taiwan,Chang F;Wang C,"Precipitation change in Taiwan during the twentieth century is investigated. Six major drought episodes in Taiwan during the period from 1897 to 2001 are identified. They are 1899-1902, 1906-1910, 1913-1916, 1960-1965, 1978-1980 and 1993-1997. That there is one episodic high sulfur-rich volcanic eruption which corresponds to each drought event is intriguing. Sulfur-rich volcanic eruption forcing from the Pinatubo eruption in 1991 is evident in the drought episode of 1993-1997. The Agung eruption (1963) coincides with the centre of a drought episode (1960-1965) of about a half decade duration. Together with all the other eruptions, this indicates that high sulfur-rich volcanic eruptions bear some relationships to drought episodes in Taiwan with durations of from three years to six years.","Department of Atmospheric Sciences, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan; Institute of Earth Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,0.0,"Chang, F.-C.; Department of Atmospheric Sciences, , Taipei, Taiwan; 電子郵件: fchang@linho2.ntu.edu.tw",,NA NA,Drought episodes;  Precipitation change;  Sulfur-rich volcanic eruptions;  Taiwan,,Article,Climate change;  Drought;  Precipitation (meteorology);  Sulfur; Volcanic eruption; Volcanoes; climate change;  drought;  precipitation (climatology);  sulfur emission;  twentieth century;  volcanic eruption; Taiwan; Pinatubo,,IAHS-AISH Publication,2,,scopus,NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY;INSTITUTE OF EARTH SCIENCES,DEPARTMENT OF ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES,B1
2003.0,IAHS-AISH Publ.,Effects of landuse change on runoff response in the ungauged TaChou basin Taiwan,Yu P;Wang Y;Kuo C,"Land development and urbanization have increased significantly in Taiwan over the last two decades because of the increasing population and economic development. The ungauged Ta-Chou basin, which is representative of drainage basins undergoing these changes, was chosen to investigate the effects of land-use change on surface runoff. Supervised classification of Landsat MSS and SPOT satellite images was used to show land-use change from 1972 to 2000. During this period, the area of impervious land increased by approximately 220%, and the area occupied by rice paddies decreased by about 55%. Results from a distributed rainfall-runoff model reveal that the observed land-use change causes increases in both peak discharge and total runoff. For design storms having return periods ranging from 10 to 200 years, peak discharge increased from 6 to 10% and total runoff increased from 10 to 17%. The methods outlined may be used to investigate the effects of land-use change on runoff response in ungauged basins elsewhere.","Department of Hydraulic/Ocean Eng., National Cheng Kung University, Tainan 70101, Taiwan",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,,"Yu, P.-S.; Department of Hydraulic/Ocean Eng., , Tainan 70101, Taiwan; 電子郵件: yups@mail.ncku.edu.tw",,NA NA,Geographic information systems;  Land-use change;  Rainfall-runoff model;  Remote sensing;  Ta-Chou basin;  Taiwan;  Ungauged basin,,Article,Catchments;  Image processing;  Mathematical models;  Satellites;  Storms;  Sustainable development; Urbanization; Runoff; hydrological change;  land use change;  rainfall-runoff modeling;  remote sensing;  river discharge;  urbanization; Asia;  Eurasia;  Far East;  Taiwan,,IAHS-AISH Publication,7,,scopus,NATIONAL CHENG KUNG UNIVERSITY,NOTREPORTED,A

2022.0,Ichnos,Selective colonization after storm events in a delta environment applied ichnology from the early Miocene of Taiwan,Miguez-Salas O;Lowemark L;Pan Y;Rodriguez-Tovar F,"The sedimentological and palaeoecological interpretation of early Miocene age shallow marine deposits from one of the most emblematic geological areas of Taiwan - Yehliu peninsula - is not easy to approach in detail, and several contrasting proposals can be found in the literature. The present ichnological study helps to corroborate a delta environment as the most likely palaeoenvironmental setting, and to recognize the different sub-environments and hydrodynamic processes involved. The distal delta front displays the greatest trace fossil diversity, assigned to the Cruziana ichnofacies, including Ophiomorpha, Phycosiphon, Planolites, Rosselia, Schaubcylindrichnus, Scolicia, Thalassinoides and vertical equilibrium adjustment structures. The delta front records predominantly vertical traces attributable to the Skolithos ichnofacies. Amalgamated shell beds (most likely related to storm events) show concentrations of broken bivalve shells. After storm a selective colonization is interpreted, firstly by bioerosive tracemakers during times of decreasing sedimentation rate, followed by a dominance of trophic generalists such as those producing Ophiomorpha during post-storm sedimentation.","Univ Granada, Dept Estratig & Paleontol, Granada 18002, Spain.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei, Taiwan.;",SPAIN;TAIWAN,SPAIN,SPAIN,4,2.0,1.0,"Miguez-Salas, O (corresponding author), Univ Granada, Dept Estratig & Paleontol, Granada 18002, Spain.","Secretaria de Estado de I + D+I, SpainSpanish Government [CGL2015-66835-P]; Junta de AndaluciaJunta de Andalucia [RNM-178]; Universidad de Granada [UCE-2016-05]; Spains Ministerio de Educacion, Cultura y DeporteSpanish Government; SUMMER PROGRAM IN TAIWAN FOR SPANISH GRADUATE STUDENTS; Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan [MOST] [106-2116-M-002-021]","This study was funded by project CGL2015-66835-P (Secretaria de Estado de I + D+I, Spain), Research Group RNM-178 (Junta de Andalucia) and Scientific Excellence Unit UCE-2016-05 (Universidad de Granada).

1998.0,Int. Geol. Rev.,NdSr isotopic and geochemical evidence on the protoliths of exotic blocks in the Juisui Area Yuli Belt Taiwan,Sun C;Smith A;Chen C,"The Yuli belt of eastern Taiwan comprises a Late Cretaceous subduction complex of exotic blocks enclosed within blackschist. The latter yield T-DM model ages of 1500 to 1700 Ma identical to Taiwan sediments, indicating a derivation from basement strata of the Eurasian continental margin. Of the three exotic blocks in the Juisui area, the Tamayen and Tsunkuanshan represent fragments of island-arc assemblages. Meta-igneous rocks in these blocks have compositions from basalt to andesite and have epsilon Nd(100 Ma) values ranging from +1.0 to +10.4,, and in the Tamayen block are associated with a deep-sea sediment assemblage. The latter has the chemical and isotopic characteristics of oceanic red clays and tuffaceous material, and has been metamorphosed to glaucophane schist on accretion of the are material to the Eurasian continental margin. In the Tsunkuanshan and Wuho blocks, the sediment assemblage is blackschist similar to that in the Yuli belt, suggesting that these blocks either originated close to the continental margin or underwent severe disruption on accretion. Meta-igenous rocks in the Wuho block are tholeiites of probable ocean-island affinity, and have epsilon Nd(100 Ma) values of + 5.5 to + 6.0. In contrast to the Sm-Nd system, Rb-Sr isotype systematics have been variably reset in all three blocks and the surrounding Yuli blackschists during crustal accretion and subsequent metamorphism. The volume of juvenile relative to continental-derived sediment in the Yuli belt is consistent with the notion that much young continental crust is recycled material. Of the juvenile material, approximately 75% is derived from island area, with the remaining percentage comprising ocean islands and other ocean-floor material.","Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.; Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei 115, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,USA,3,1.0,0.0,"Sun, CH (corresponding author), Univ Texas, Ctr Lithospher Studies, POB 830688, Richardson, TX 75083 USA.",,,,10.1080/00206819809465255,Article,PELAGIC SEDIMENTS; EVOLUTION; MANTLE; GENESIS; BASALTS; MAGMA,V H WINSTON & SON INC,INTERNATIONAL GEOLOGY REVIEW,11,40,ISI,NATL CHENG KUNG UNIV;INST EARTH SCI,UNIV TEXAS,B2

2005.0,Int. Geol.

The first prominent, systematic change in delta(13)C values occurs in samples of the middle greenschist facies, with delta(13)C values higher than -24 parts per thousand. Carbon isotope fractionation between coexisting calcite and carbonaceous material suggests that this marked change might have taken place at around 300-350 degrees C. From systematic temperature variations, two thermal maxima, 430 degrees C and 460-490 degrees C, were delineated in the central part of the Hsuehshan Range and the Backbone Range, respectively, and are attributed to Cenozoic mountain building. High temperatures (> 500 degrees C) were detected in some marble samples adjacent to Mesozoic granite intrusions, indicating that pre-existing thermal records are preserved in these marbles. The carbon isotope fractionation preserved in rocks across the mountain belt therefore may not have been synchronous.","Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei 115, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,1,1.0,1.0,"Yui, TF (corresponding author), Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, POB 1-55, Taipei 115, Taiwan.",,,,10.2747/0020-6814.47.3.310,Article,GRAPHITE; CALCITE; FRACTIONATION; GRAPHITIZATION; THERMOMETRY; MARBLES; DIOXIDE; OXYGEN; RANGE; METASEDIMENTS,V H WINSTON & SON INC,INTERNATIONAL GEOLOGY REVIEW,13,47,ISI,INST EARTH SCI,INST EARTH SCI,B2

2007.0,Int. Geol. Rev.,Primary geologic sources of arsenic in the Chianan Plain Blackfoot disease area and the Lanyang Plain of Taiwan,Lewis C;Ray D;Chiu K,"The area that includes Beimen and the immediate surrounding villages of southwestern Taiwan is recognized as the home of the worlds only well-documented Blackfoot Disease (BFD) occurrence-where extremely high concentrations of arsenic (As) have been found in the artesian wells from the Chianan Plain that were previously used as a drinking water supply. In the past decade, very high levels of arsenic have also been discovered in the potable water from the Lanyang Plain of northeastern Taiwan, but BFD does not occur there. From regional geological/geophysical field investigations in these two areas and a literature survey of arsenic problems in the drinking water of other countries, we have identified five potential primary geologic sources of the As for the BFD area and six sources for the Lanyang Plain. We also report measurements of arsenic in two ""new"" areas: (1) the sea water west of the BFD area (three samples with As levels of 2.32, 7.46, and 9.71. mu g/L; and (2) stream bed deposits east of the BFD area (two samples with As concentrations of 0.00485 wt% and 0.23000 wt%). With the current information available, it seems most plausible that the primary source of the arsenic in the BFD area is from fluid escape from the accretionary prism of Taiwan or from in situ formation of arsenic-laden sulfide minerals in the water-rich coastal sediments, whereas the most likely sources of the high concentrations of arsenic in the Lanyang Plain are hydrothermal venting in the Okinawa Basin and/or weathering of sulfide minerals associated with gold and copper ores along the Lishan fault to the south. Although oxidation is known to play a role in the formation of some arsenic compounds, most of these 11 primary sources and their associated rocks and minerals are originally related to reducing environments; however, continued research is necessary to fully explain each source's expulsion mechanism (mobility), transport (if any), and final concentration or enrichment of arsenic in the groundwater of Taiwan.","Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Resources Engn, Theoret & Appl Geophys Lab, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.; Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Surface Chem Lab, Dept Resources Engn, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,,"Lewis, C (corresponding author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Resources Engn, Theoret & Appl Geophys Lab, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.",,,,10.2747/0020-6814.49.10.947,Article,OKINAWA TROUGH; MUD VOLCANOS; CONTAMINATION; GEOCHEMISTRY; CONSTRAINTS; GENESIS; BASIN; JADE,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,INTERNATIONAL GEOLOGY REVIEW,9,49,ISI,NATL CHENG KUNG UNIV;NATL CHENG KUNG UNIV,NATL CHENG KUNG UNIV,A
2009.0,Int. Geol. Rev.,Late TriassicLate Cretaceous accretionsubduction in the Taiwan region along the eastern margin of South China evidence from zircon SHRIMP dating,Yui T;Okamoto K;Usuki T;Lan C;Chu H;Liou J,"To examine the tectonic history of the Taiwan segment of the eastern margin of South China, six rock samples from the Tailuko belt, the metamorphic basement of Taiwan, were selected for zircon SHRIMP dating. The aim was to identify evidence shedding light on the timing of the change from passive to active tectonics for this part of the continental margin since South China separated from the supercontinent of Rodinia. The results lead to two age groups, 190-200 and 88-90Ma. These age groups, augmented by the previously published age data, suggest that they could have resulted from two Mesozoic accretion/subduction events. In addition, this mid-late Mesozoic Tailuko belt might have also been reactivated and structurally complicated by the late Cenozoic collision/accretion of the Luzon arc with the Eurasian continent. Records of older tectonic events, such as those derived from the Japanese Islands, are absent in this metamorphic basement. An important finding of this study is the existence of the 19110Ma Talun metagranite, the oldest granitic intrusion ever reported in the Taiwan region and along the eastern coast area of South China. In spite of a large age uncertainty, the occurrence of this metagranite is not consistent with the apparent younging trend of Jurassic-Cretaceous igneous activity toward the coastline in South China, and should be taken into consideration by future studies.","Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei 115, Taiwan.;  Cent Geol Survey, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Stanford Univ, Dept Geol & Environm Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;USA,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,6,1.0,1.0,"Yui, TF (corresponding author), Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei 115, Taiwan.","NSCMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","This work was partly supported by NSC grants to TFY and CYL.

Rev.,Dating thin zircon rims by NanoSIMS the Fengtien nephrite Taiwan is the youngest jade on Earth,Yui T;Usuki T;Chen C;Ishida A;Sano Y;Suga K;Iizuka Y;Chen C,"Nephrite in the Fengtien area of the eastern part of the Central Mountain Range, Taiwan, is associated with antigorite-serpentinite within the Yuli belt, a late Cenozoic subduction-accretionary complex related to the eastward subduction of the South China Sea plate forming the Luzon arc. Diopsidite and clinozoisite rock are two other metasomatic components accompanying nephrite between serpentinites and the greenschist-facies country rock (carbonaceous material-)quartz-mica schist. Detrital zircons were separated from one clinozoisite rock sample, formed through metasomatic replacement after mica-quartz schist at temperatures of 320-420 degrees C or slightly lower, which is lower than the metamorphic temperature conditions of the Yuli belt. Most of the detrital zircons have thin zircon rims less than 15-20 mu m wide. These zircon rims, considered as newly formed during metasomatism leading to nephrite/diopsidite/clinozoisite rock formation, were dated by a high lateral resolution secondary ion mass spectrometer (CAMECA NanoSIMS NS50). The resulting U-238/Pb-206-Pb-204/Pb-206 inverse isochron gave an age of 3.3 +/- 1.7Ma. The collision of the Eurasian continental margin with the Luzon arc has been suggested to have begun at ca. 6.5Ma in the Taiwan area. The nephrite formation processes therefore clearly post-dated South China Sea plate subduction. The present date, substantiated by the metamorphic and metasomatic temperature information, demonstrates that the fluid-rock interaction forming Fengtien nephrite would have taken place during a Barrovian-type metamorphic overprint resulting from arc-continent collision, leading to the exhumation of the Yuli belt. This conclusion on nephrite formation with regard to regional tectonics can serve as a working model for future studies on other nephrite deposits with similar occurrences, mostly embedded within Mesozoic or older subduction-accretionary complexes. The Fengtien nephrite deposit is therefore the youngest one of its kind exposed on Earth's surface.","Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei 11529, Taiwan.;  Univ Tokyo, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778564, Japan.;",TAIWAN;JAPAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,8,1.0,1.0,"Yui, TF (corresponding author), Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei 11529, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and Technology, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [NSC 101-2116-M-001-004-MY3]","This study was financially supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [grant number NSC 101-2116-M-001-004-MY3].",Taiwan; nephrite; NanoSIMS; U-Pb dating; zircon,10.1080/00206814.2014.972994,Article,ARC-CONTINENT COLLISION; SOUTH CHINA SEA; U-PB; HIGH-PRESSURE; TECTONIC IMPLICATIONS; METAMORPHIC ROCKS; STABLE-ISOTOPE; DULUTH COMPLEX; EASTERN TAIWAN; JADEITITE,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,INTERNATIONAL GEOLOGY REVIEW,15,56,ISI,INST EARTH SCI;UNIV TOKYO,INST EARTH SCI,B2
2014.0,Int. Geol. Rev.,Generation of calcalkaline andesite of the Tatun volcanic group Taiwan within an extensional environment by crystal fractionation,Shellnutt J;Belousov A;Belousova M;Wang K;Zellmer G,"The Pliocene-Pleistocene northern Taiwan volcanic zone (NTVZ) is located within a trench-arc-back-arc basin and oblique arc-continent collision zone. Consequently the origin and tectonic setting of the andesitic rocks within the NTVZ and their relation to other circum-Pacific volcanic island-arc systems is uncertain. Rocks collected from the Tatun volcanic group (TTVG) include basaltic to andesitic rocks. The basalt is compositionally similar to within-plate continental tholeiites whereas the basaltic andesite and andesite are calc-alkaline; however, all rocks show a distinct depletion of Nb-Ta in their normalized incompatible element diagrams. The Sr-Nd isotope compositions of the TTVG rocks are very similar and have a relatively restricted range (i.e. I-Sr = 0.70417-0.70488; epsilon Nd-(T) = +2.2 to +3.1), suggesting that they are derived directly or indirectly from the same mantle source. The basalts are likely derived by mixing between melts from the asthenosphere and a subduction-modified subcontinental lithospheric mantle (SCLM) source, whereas the basaltic andesites may be derived by partial melting of pyroxenitic lenses within the SCLM and mixing with asthenospheric melts. MELTS modelling using a starting composition equal to the most primitive basaltic andesite, shallow-pressure (i.e. <= 1 kbar), oxidizing conditions (i.e. FMQ +1), and near water saturation will produce compositions similar to the andesites observed in this study. Petrological modelling and the Sr-Nd isotope results indicate that the volcanic rocks from TTVG, including the spatially and temporally associated Kuanyinshan volcanic rocks, are derived from the same mantle source and that the andesites are the product of fractional crystallization of a parental magma similar in composition to the basaltic andesites. Furthermore, our results indicate that, in some cases, calc-alkaline andesites may be generated by crystal fractionation of mafic magmas derived in an extensional back-arc setting rather than a subduction zone setting.","Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Inst Volcanol & Seismol, Petropavlovsk Kamchatski, Russia.;  Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei 115, Taiwan.;  Massey Univ, Soil & Earth Sci Grp, Palmerston North, New Zealand.;",TAIWAN;RUSSIA;TAIWAN;NEW ZEALAND,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,5,1.0,1.0,"Shellnutt, JG (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.","NSCMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [102-2628-M-003-001-MY4]",This project was partially supported by NSC grant 102-2628-M-003-001-MY4 to JGS.,andesite; quaternary volcanism; Tatun volcanic zone; Taiwan; crystal fractionation,10.1080/00206814.2014.921865,Article,NORTHERN TAIWAN; MANTLE WEDGE; POSTCOLLISIONAL MAGMATISM; GEOCHEMICAL CONSTRAINTS; BASALTIC ANDESITES; GENESIS; EVOLUTION; ZONE; CRYSTALLIZATION; DIFFERENTIATION,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,INTERNATIONAL GEOLOGY REVIEW,9,56,ISI,NATL TAIWAN NORMAL UNIV;INST VOLCANOL AND SEISMOL;INST EARTH SCI;MASSEY UNIV,NATL TAIWAN NORMAL UNIV,B2
2017.0,Int. Geol. Rev.,Subductionrelated 200 Ma Talun metagranite SE Taiwan an age constraint for palaeoPacific plate subduction beneath South China Block during the Mesozoic,Yui T;Chu H;Suga K;Lan C;Chung S;Wang K;Grove M,"Various tectonic models have been proposed to account for the widely distributed igneous activities in the southeastern part of the South China Block (SCB) during the Triassic-Jurassic period. One of the major contending debates is on the timing of initiation of the palaeo-Pacific plate subduction under the SCB, due to lack of unequivocal evidence for arc magmatism during the period in this region.The 191 +/- 10Ma (N=5, MSWD=12) calc-alkalic high-K I-type Talun metagranite occurs in the southern Tailuko belt of the Tananao metamorphic complex, Taiwan. In terms of age, this metagranite belongs to the Early Yanshanian igneous activity in the southeastern part of the SCB. However, its geographic position does not accord with the well-known general oceanward younging trend of the Yansnanian igneous rocks. In view of the large age uncertainty reported, this metagranite is redated in this study. Some zircons of this metagranite are high in U content and are metamict. Zircons with low U contents are analysed by SHRIMP yielding a more precise age of 200 +/- 2Ma (N=10, MSWD=4). In particular, the epsilon Hf(t) of these dated zircons ranges from +4.5 to +12.9. The metagranite mainly consists of quartz, K-feldspar, plagioclase, with minor amounts of garnet, biotite, zircon, apatite, and pyrrhotite. Chlorite and calcite are secondary phases overprinted by the later tectonic event(s). Its initial Sr isotope compositional range is 0.70473-0.70588, and epsilon Nd(t), +2.4 to +3.6. The results demonstrate that the genesis of this metagranite could be attributed to the assimilation-fractionation of a depleted mantle-derived basaltic magma, which was most likely related to arc magmatism. The present study therefore offers key evidence that during the Mesozoic, the palaeo-Pacific plate subduction underneath the SCB would have taken place no later than the very early Jurassic.","Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Cent Geol Survey, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Stanford Univ, Dept Geol & Environm Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;USA,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,7,1.0,1.0,"Yui, TF (corresponding author), Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.",MOSTMinistry of Science and Technology (MOST) Korea [104-2116-M-001-017],This work was supported by the MOST [Grant Number: 104-2116-M-001-017].,Talun metagranite; Taiwan; U-Pb zircon age; the Yanshanian igneous activity; South China Block,10.1080/00206814.2016.1261259,Article,GRANITIC-ROCKS; SOUTHEASTERN CHINA; TECTONIC SIGNIFICANCE; U-PB; ISOTOPIC GEOCHEMISTRY; EVOLUTION; GEOCHRONOLOGY; PETROGENESIS; PROVINCE; AREA,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,INTERNATIONAL GEOLOGY REVIEW,15,59,ISI,INST EARTH SCI;STANFORD UNIV,INST EARTH SCI,B2

Geoinf.,Development of a spatial decision support system for monitoring earthquakeinduced landslides based on aerial photographs and the finite element method,Chang K;Wan S;Lei T,"The evaluation of slope stability is essential for the management of landslide hazards. The integration of spatial information and geomechanical modeling facilitates the understanding and evaluation of landslide hazards. In this study, we use a spatial decision support system (SDSS)-incorporating aerial photographic data, GIS techniques, field investigations, and finite element geomechanical modeling to analyze the mechanisms of the Hungtaiping landslide, which was induced by the 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake. The analysis clarifies the slide mechanisms that cannot be revealed either by examining aerial photographic or underground exploration data alone. The finite element modeling calibrated using digital aerial photographic data shows that the landslide results from the deformation and slides of the thick colluvium. Surficial displacements in the twenties of meters are attributed to the slide between the colluvium and the bedrock as well as the shear deformation and slides within the colluvium. The landslide SDSS can help determine model parameters, evaluate slide mechanisms and remediation measures, and predict slope behavior for a subsequent earthquake event. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Geoinf.,Largearea rice yield forecasting using satellite imageries,Wang Y;Chang K;Chen R;Lo J;Shen Y,"Ability to make large-area yield prediction before harvest is important in many aspects of agricultural decision-making. In this study, canopy reflectance band ratios (NIR/RED, NIR/GRN) of paddy rice (Oryza sativa L.) at booting stage, from field measurements conducted from 1999 to 2005, were correlated with the corresponding yield data to derive regression-type yield prediction models for the first and second season crop, respectively. These yield models were then validated with ground truth measurements conducted in 2007 and 2008 at eight sites, of different soil properties, climatic conditions, and various treatments in cultivars planted and N application rates, using surface reflectance retrieved from atmospherically corrected SPOT imageries. These validation tests indicated that root mean square error of predicting grain yields per unit area by the proposed models were less than 0.7 T ha(-1) for both cropping seasons. Since village is the basic unit for national rice yield census statistics in Taiwan, the yield models were further used to forecast average regional yields for 14 selected villages and compared with officially reported data. Results indicate that the average yield per unit area at village scale can be forecasted with a root mean square error of 1.1 T ha(-1) provided no damaging weather occurred during the final month before actual harvest. The methodology can be applied to other optical sensors with similar spectral bands in the visible/near-infrared and to different geographical regions provided that the relation between yield and spectral index is established.

Geoinf.,Study on estimating the evapotranspiration cover coefficient for stream flow simulation through remote sensing techniques,Wu C;Cheng C;Lo H;Chen Y,"This study focuses on using remote sensing techniques to estimate the evapotranspiration cover coefficient (CV) which is an important parameter for stream flow. The objective is to derive more accurate stream flow from the estimated CV. The study area is located in the Dan-Shuei watershed in northern Taiwan. The processes include the land-use classification using hybrid classification and four Landsat-5 TM images; the CV estimations based on remote sensing and traditional approaches; comparison of stream flow simulation according to the above two CV values. The result indicated that the study area was classified into seven land-use types with 88.3% classification accuracy. The simulated stream flow using remote sensing approach could represent more accurate hydrological characteristics than a traditional approach. Obviously integrating remote sensing technique and the SEBAL model is a useful approach to estimate the CV. The CV parameter estimated by remote sensing technique did improve the accuracy of the stream flow simulation. Therefore, the results can be extended to further studies such as forest water management. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The net radiation was in a similar range in all three study areas because the cities are in close proximity to each other. Tainan City released 60-70% of the sensible heat flux of the other cities because of its smaller size. Taichung City, which is located in a basin, exhibited the largest sensible heat flux, due to the radiation cooling during the night before the observation. Anthropogenic heat discharge clearly decreased the storage heat flux in certain industrial areas in Kaohsiung City and Taichung City, while the small scale urban functions moderated the variation of storage heat flux in Tainan City. These results imply that the terrain around a given city as well as the scale of urban activity significantly affect the heat balance in the cities. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

2014.0,Int. J. Appl. Earth Obs. Geoinf.,Spatiotemporal analysis of vegetation index after typhoons in the mountainous watershed,Chu H,"An extensive land cover change was triggered by a series of typhoons, especially Typhoon Morakot in 2009 in Taiwan. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) series from multiple satellite images were applied to monitor the change processes of land cover. This study applied spatiotemporal analysis tools, including empirical orthogonal functions (EOF), and multiple variograms in analyzing space-time NDVI data, and detected the effects of large chronological disturbances in the characteristics of land cover changes. Spatiotemporal analysis delineated the temporal patterns and spatial variability of NDVI caused by these large typhoons. Results showed that mean of NDVI decreased but spatial variablity of NDVI increased after typhoons in the study area. The EOF can clarify the major component of NDVI variations and identify the core area of the NDVI changes. Various approaches showed consistent results that Typhoon Morakot significantly lowered the NDVI in land cover change process. Furthermore, the spatiotemporal analysis is an effective monitoring tool, which advocates the use of the index for the quantification of land cover change and resilience. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

2015.0,Int. J. Appl. Earth Obs. Geoinf.,Detecting the changes in rural communities in Taiwan by applying multiphase segmentation on FORMOSA2 satellite imagery,Huang Y,"Agricultural activities mainly occur in rural areas; recently, ecological conservation and biological diversity are being emphasized in rural communities to promote sustainable development for rural communities, especially for rural communities in Taiwan. Therefore, since 2005, many rural communities in Taiwan have compiled their own development strategies in order to create their own unique characteristics to attract people to visit and stay in rural communities. By implementing these strategies, young people can stay in their own rural communities and the rural communities are rejuvenated. However, some rural communities introduce artificial construction into the community such that the ecological and biological environments are significantly degraded. The strategies need to be efficiently monitored because up to 67 rural communities have proposed rejuvenation projects. In 2015, up to 440 rural communities were estimated to be involved in rural community rejuvenations. How to monitor the changes occurring in those rural communities participating in rural community rejuvenation such that ecological conservation and ecological diversity can be satisfied is an important issue in rural community management. Remote sensing provides an efficient and rapid method to achieve this issue. Segmentation plays a fundamental role in human perception. In this respect, segmentation can be used as the process of transforming the collection of pixels of an image into a group of regions or objects with meaning. This paper proposed an algorithm based on the multiphase approach to segment the normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI, of the rural communities into several sub-regions, and to have the NDV1 distribution in each sub-region be homogeneous. Those regions whose values of NDVI are close will be merged into the same class. In doing so, a complex NDVI map can be simplified into two groups: the high and low values of NDVI. The class with low NDVI values corresponds to those regions containing roads, buildings, and other manmade construction works and the class with high values of NDVI indicates that those regions contain vegetation in good health. In order to verify the processed results, the regional boundaries were extracted and laid down on the given images to check whether the extracted boundaries were laid down on buildings, roads, or other artificial constructions. In addition to the proposed approach, another approach called statistical region merging was employed by grouping sets of pixels with homogeneous properties such that those sets are iteratively grown by combining smaller regions or pixels. In doing so, the segmented NDVI map can be generated. By comparing the areas of the merged classes in different years, the changes occurring in the rural communities of Taiwan can be detected. The satellite imagery of FORMOSA-2 with 2-m ground resolution is employed to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. The satellite imagery of two rural communities (Jhumen and Taomi communities) is chosen to evaluate environmental changes between 2005 and 2010. The change maps of 2005-2010 show that a high density of green on a patch of land is increased by 19.62 ha in Jhumen community and conversely a similar patch of land is significantly decreased by 236.59 ha in Taomi community. Furthermore, the change maps created by another image segmentation method called statistical region merging generate similar processed results to multiphase segmentation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

2015.0,Int. J. Appl. Earth Obs. Geoinf.,Waveformbased point cloud classification in landcover identification,Tseng Y;Wang C;Chu H;Hung Y,"Full-waveform topographic LiDAR data provide more detailed information about objects along the path of a laser pulse than discrete-return (echo) topographic LiDAR data. Full-waveform topographic LiDAR data consist of a succession of cross-section profiles of landscapes and each waveform can be decomposed into a sum of echoes. The echo number reveals critical information in classifying land cover types. Most land covers contain one echo, whereas topographic LiDAR data in trees and roof edges contained multi-echo waveform features. To identify land-cover types, waveform-based classifier was integrated single-echo and multi-echo classifiers for point cloud classification. The experimental area was the Namasha district of Southern Taiwan, and the land-cover objects were categorized as roads, trees (canopy), grass (grass and crop), bare (bare ground), and buildings (buildings and roof edges). Waveform features were analyzed with respect to the single- and multi-echo laser-path samples, and the critical waveform features were selected according to the Bhattacharyya distance. Next, waveform-based classifiers were performed using support vector machine (SVM) with the local, spatial features of waveform topographic LiDAR information, and optical image information. Results showed that by using fused waveform and optical information, the waveform-based classifiers achieved the highest overall accuracy in identifying land-cover point clouds among the models, especially when compared to an echo-based classifier.

2017.0,Int. J. Appl. Earth Obs. Geoinf.,A study of a matching pixel by pixel MPP algorithm to establish an empirical model of water quality mapping as based on unmanned aerial vehicle UAV images,Su T,"Linear regression models are a popular choice for the relationships between water quality parameters and bands (or band ratios) of remote sensing data. However, this research regards the phenomena of mixed pixels, specular reflection, and water fluidity as the challenges to establish a robust regression infidel. Based on the data of measurements in situ and remote sensing data, this study presents an enumeration based algorithm, called matching pixel by pixel (MPP), and tests its performance in an empirical model of water quality mapping. Four small reservoirs, which cover a mere several hundred-thousand m(2), in Kinmen, Taiwan, are selected as the study sites. The multispectral sensors, carried on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), are adopted to acquire remote sensing data regarding water quality parameters, including chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), Secchi disk depth (SDD), and turbidity in the reservoirs. The experimental results indicate that, while MPP can reduce the influence of specular reflection on regression model establishment, specular reflection does hamper the correction of thematic map production. Due to Water fluidity, sampling in situ should be followed by UAV imaging as soon as possible. Excluding turbidity, the obtained estimation accuracy can satisfy the national standard.

We generated synthetic fingerprints from two FORMOSAT-2 images acquired in 2009 and tested the procedure on two other images, one in 2005 and the other in 2009. We also obtained two landslide maps through manual interpretation. The agreement between the two sets of inventories is given by the Cohen's k coefficients of 0.62 and 0.64, respectively.

2019.0,Int. J. Appl. Earth Obs. Geoinf.,A metabolic scaling theorydriven remote sensing approach to map spatiotemporal dynamics of litterfall in a tropical montane cloud forest,Hu K;Huang C,"Litter production, or litterfall, is a predominant part of the carbon and nutrient cycles of forest ecosystems. As a major and relatively invariable aspect of primary production, litterfall could be a predictor of total plant production. However, the conventional field approach for its estimation is laborious and costly. High temporal resolution optical satellite imagery may strengthen our ability to estimate litterfall over a vast region, but this remote sensing method is limited in some tropical and near-tropical mountainous regions, mainly due to coarse spatial resolution and frequent cloud coverage. The metabolic scaling theory (MST) states that forest productivity (including litterfall) is directly proportional to the mass of the photosynthesis tissue (leaves), and spatially, it may be isometrically scaled using the size of the largest individual in the system. In this study, we investigated the temporal dimension of the MST and hypothesized that the maximum leaf abundance over a year could also be a key determinant of annual litter production. The relationship between the leaf mass during the peak growing season and annual litterfall could facilitate large-scale litterfall mapping in mountainous terrains, since vegetation indices such as the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) or the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), commonly utilized as a surrogate for leaf abundance, can be derived from relatively high spatial resolution satellite imagery. We correlated the summer growing season Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper plus (ETM+) EVI and NDVI for 2016 and 2017 and the temporally corresponding annual accumulated field litterfall data acquired from hinoki (Chamaecyparis spp.) dominant tropical montane cloud forests in northeastern Taiwan (23.98 N, 120.97 E). We found that the summer growing season EVI and NDVI may be salient variables to explain the spatial variation of annual litter production (r(2) = 0.39-0.67, p <= 0.01). The results have profound implications for applying MST to the regional mapping of ecosystem production across space and time in humid tropical regions, and these implications may facilitate the remote assessment of the terrestrial carbon budget.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geog, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Res Ctr Future Earth, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,,"Huang, CY (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geog, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST)Ministry of Science and Technology, China [104-2621-B-002-004-MY3]; National Taiwan UniversityNational Taiwan University [NTU107L9010]; Research Center for Future Earth in Taiwan; Featured Areas Research Center Program in Taiwan; Higher Education Sprout Project in Taiwan; Ministry of Education (MOE) in TaiwanMinistry of Education, Taiwan","Brian Enquist is thanked for several in-depth discussions with C.H. during his sabbatical year in 2017-2018 in Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at University of Arizona.

2020.0,Int. J. Appl. Earth Obs. Geoinf.,Estimating the starting time and identifying the type of urbanization based on dense time series of landsatderived VegetationImperviousSoil VIS maps A case study of North Taiwan from 1990 to 2015,Shih H;Stow D;Tsai Y;Roberts D,"Land cover and land use change (LCLUC) is a global phenomenon, and LCLUC in urbanizing regions has substantial impacts on humans and their environments. In this paper, a semi-automatic approach to identifying the type and starting time of urbanization was developed and tested based on dense time series of Vegetation-Impervious-Soil (V-I-S) maps derived from Landsat surface reflectance imagery. The accuracy of modeled V-I-S fractions and the estimated time of initial change in impervious cover were assessed. North Taiwan, one of the regions of the island of Taiwan that experienced the greatest urban LCLUC, was chosen as a test area, and the study period is 1990 to 2015, a period of substantial urbanization. In total, 295 dates of Landsat imagery were used to create 295 V-I-S fraction maps that were used to construct fractional cover time series for each pixel. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)s for the modeled Vegetation, Impervious, and Soil were 25 %, 22 %, 24 % respectively. The time of Urban Expansion is estimated by logistic regression applied to Impervious cover time series, while the time of change for Urban Renewal is determined by the period of brief Soil exposure. The identified location and estimated time for newly urbanized lands were generally accurate, with 80% of Urban Expansion estimated within +/- 2.4 years. However, the accuracy of identified Urban Renewal was relatively low. Our approach to identifying Urban Expansion with dense time series of Landsat imagery is shown to be reliable, while Urban Renewal identification is not.","San Diego State Univ, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.;  Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.;",USA;TAIWAN;USA,USA,USA,4,2.0,,"Shih, HC (corresponding author), San Diego State Univ, Dept Geog, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",Yin Chin Foundation of U.S.A.; STUF United Fund Inc.; Long Jen-Yi Travel fund through San Diego State University,"This study is funded by Yin Chin Foundation of U.S.A., STUF United Fund Inc., as well the Long Jen-Yi Travel fund and doctoral stipends through San Diego State University.",Landsat; Spectral mixture analysis; Urbanization; Change detection; Time series analysis; Logistic regression; Vegetation-Impervious-Soil,10.1016/j.jag.2019.101987,Article,SPECTRAL MIXTURE ANALYSIS; SURFACE; CLASSIFICATION,ELSEVIER,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION,6,85,ISI,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIV;NATL TAIWAN NORMAL UNIV;UNIV CALIF SANTA BARBARA,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIV,A

In this study, we developed a new method for obtaining a high-resolution, 1'x1'-grid SLT model, using the time-varying mean sea surface (MSS) of several MSSs calculated from averaged multi-satellite-derived sea surface heights (TOPEX/Poseidon, Jason-1/2/3, ERS-1/2, Envisat, GFO, Cryosat-2, SARAL/AltiKa, Sentinel-3A, HY-2A) over different periods. We applied this model to estimate the mean sea level change in the China seas and their adjacent ocean (0 degrees-41 degrees N, 100 degrees-140 degrees E). This new model revealed the patterning of sea level change within the study region in detail, and detected a sea level change dipole south of Japan. A zonal SLT pattern was identified in three regions: the region of the North Pacific Subtropical Counter Current (an eastward current located in the band of 19.5 degrees-22.5 degrees N, populated with eddies), and the areas east of Taiwan and east of Luzon Island. Moreover, the rate of sea level rise in the offshore zone was found to be similar to 0.67 mm/yr (20%) higher than that in the open ocean.

2021.0,Int. J. Appl. Earth Obs. Geoinf.,Multiple timescale assessment of wet season precipitation estimation over Taiwan using the PERSIANN family products,Huang W;Liu P;Hsu J,"This study evaluates the performance of five satellite precipitation products (SPPs) from the Precipitation Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN) family for depicting precipitation changes in Taiwan over multiple timescales. Rain gauge data provided by the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) of Taiwan were used as a reference for evaluation, which focused on the wet seasons (May to October) during the period 2003-2019. All SPPs were found to have good ability in expressing the temporal phase changes over most of Taiwan on all the timescales examined, with significant temporal correlation coefficients (TCC) observed between the SPPs and the CWB data. We further evaluated the performance of the SPPs in making quantitative precipitation estimates based on the root mean square error (RMSE). For all examined timescales, the comparison between the best and worst performance shows greater normalized differences in quantitative estimates (i.e., RMSE) than in temporal phase depiction (i.e., TCC). In general, all SPPs tend to underestimate precipitation over most of Taiwan; however, two relatively new products (PDIR-Now and PERSIANN-CCS-CDR) have better RMSE performance than other SPPs on different timescales. PDIR-Now is the best product for quantitatively estimating precipitation on interannual, annual, and seasonal timescales, while PERSIANN-CCS-CDR is superior for daily and diurnal timescales. The findings also highlight that the performance of the PERSIANN-family in quantitatively estimating Taiwan precipitation does not depend primarily on the spatiotemporal resolution of SPPs, but may be related to the use of the cloud patch approach and the inclusion of weather station information in producing PDIR-Now and PERSIANN-CCS-CDR.","Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Earth Sci, 88,Sec 4,Tingchou Rd, Taipei 11677, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,,"Huang, WR (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Earth Sci, 88,Sec 4,Tingchou Rd, Taipei 11677, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and Tech-nology of TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 106-2628-M-003-001-MY4, MOST 110-2111-M-003-003, MOST 110-2625-M-003-004]","Precipitation data provided by CHRS and CWB are highly appreci-ated.

2007.0,Int. J. Coal Geol.,Application of C7 hydrocarbons technique to oil and condensate from type III organic matter in Northwestern Taiwan,Chang C;Lee M;Lin L;Kuo C,"The purpose of this study was to examine the potential of C-7 light hydrocarbons as biomarkers for petroleum exploration. The oil and condensate reservoirs of the sedimentary basins in northwestern Taiwan generally are in the deltaic-littoral-neritic sandstones of Upper Oligocene to Upper Miocene strata. Oils and condensates produced from these basins are terrigenous, with a variable delta C-13% ratio -30.07 to -27.50%/PDB, and Pristane/Phytane ratio from 4.79 to 9.22. A large set of condensate and oil samples were collected from major gas fields across the Hsinchu-Miaola basin, and the Koval Index was used to identify C-7 light hydrocarbons in the samples. The isomeric parameters of C-7 included single-branched and multiple-branched heptanes and isomeric pairs, such as nC(7)/Methylcyclohexane ratio vs. Toluene/nC(7) ratio, 2-MH+2, 3-DMP vs. 3-MH+2, 4-DMP, n-Heptane ratio vs. iso-Heptane ratio. The ratios for parent (PI), mono-branch (P2) and poly branch (P3) heptane isomers ranged from 37 to 64%, 29 to 45% and 6 to 19%, respectively. The ratios for nC(7)/Methyleyclohexane and Toluene/nC(7) ranged from 0.16 to 0.60 and 1.52 to 10.58, respectively. The n-Heptane value and iso-Heptane value ranged from 10 to 26 and 0.8 to 1.8 respectively and the iso-alkanes (3RP), cyclopentanes (5R-P), cyclohexanes (6RP) ratios ranged from 6 to 29%, 5 to 13% and 53 to 90%, respectively with the 2-MH+2,3-DMP vs. 3-MH+2,4-DMP found to be constant for the linear equation Y = 1.1458X-0.0755. The use of this technique as a qualitative tool shows that all the oils from the northwestern Taiwan were mature, free of biodegradation, affected by evaporative fractionation and derived from the same petroleum system. The source rock of the oils should be terrigenous.

Sci.,Earthquakeinduced landslide hazard monitoring and assessment using SOM and PROMETHEE techniques A case study at the Chiufenershan area in Central Taiwan,Lin W,"Monitoring and assessment of landslide hazard is an important task for decision making and policy planning in the landslide area. Massive landslides, caused by the catastrophic Chi-Chi earthquake in 1999, occurred in Central Taiwan, especially at Chiufenershan area in Nantou county. This study proposed two useful indicators coupled with the Self-organizing map (SOM) neural network and the Preference Ranking Organization METHod for Enrichment Evaluations (PROMETHEE) technique to quickly extract accurate post-quake landslides from multi-temporal Systeme Probatoire de l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) images. A GIS-based system was developed to simplify and integrate the procedures such as image pre-processing, the SOM training, the PROMETHEE calculation, landslide extraction and accuracy assessment. The evaluated result shows that the landslide area soon after the earthquake is 209.50ha (Kappa coefficient 96.88%). Over seven years of vegetation recovery, the denudation area has declined to 112.64ha (Kappa coefficient 90.64%). Most earthquake-induced landslides could be restored by natural vegetation succession. The developed system is a useful decision-making tool for landslide area planning.","Ming Dao Univ, Dept Environm & Disaster Management, Peetow 52345, Changhua County, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,1,1.0,0.0,"Lin, WT (corresponding author), Ming Dao Univ, Dept Environm & Disaster Management, 369 Wen Hua Rd, Peetow 52345, Changhua County, Taiwan.",,,Chiufenershan area; landslide hazard assessment; self-organizing map (SOM); Preference Ranking Organization METHod for Enrichment evaluations (PROMETHEE),10.1080/13658810801914458,Article,REMOTELY-SENSED DATA; NEURAL-NETWORK; GIS; CLASSIFICATION; MODEL; ENVIRONMENT; VALIDATION; EXAMPLES; ZONATION,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE,18,22,ISI,MING DAO UNIV,MING DAO UNIV,B2

Several improved algorithms coupled with GIS techniques were proposed for automated watershed analysis. First, different from depression fill-up treatment methods, the depression watershed method coupled with the improved fuzzy c-mean algorithm allows the depression outlet location and flow directions to be determined. Second, by using the GIS-based point-and-click interface coupled with outlet-tracing and headwater-tracing algorithms, watersheds with user-specified outlets and realistic drainage networks can be easily extracted based on the derived flow directions. The analysed results can be exported to vector format for linkage with other GIS software.

In addition, the application of the results obtained by the three techniques is tested in a dynamic land-use change model (CLUE-s) for the Paochiao watershed region in Taiwan. Relative operating characteristic curves (ROCs), kappa statistics, multiple resolution validation and landscape metrics were used to assess the ability of the three techniques in estimating the relationship between driving factors and land use and its subsequent application in land-use change models. The validation results illustrate that for this case study ANNs constitute a powerful alternative for the use of logistic regression in empirical modeling of spatial land-use change processes. ANNs provide in this case a better fit between driving factors and land-use pattern. In addition, auto-logistic regression performs better than logistic regression and nearly as well as ANNs. Auto-logistic regression and ANNs are considered especially useful when the performance of more conventional models is not satisfactory or the underlying data relationships are unknown. The results indicate that an evaluation of alternative techniques to specify relationships between driving factors and land use can improve the performance of land-use change models.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Bioenvironm Syst Engn, Taipei 10764, Taiwan.;  Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Hort, Taichung 40227, Taiwan.;  Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, Amsterdam, Netherlands.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;NETHERLANDS,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,4,1.0,,"Lin, YP (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Bioenvironm Syst Engn, Taipei 10764, Taiwan.","National Science Council of the Republic of China, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [96-2415-H-002-022-MY3, 98-2621-M-002-023]","The authors would like to thank the National Science Council of the Republic of China, Taiwan, for financially supporting this research under contract nos. 96-2415-H-002-022-MY3 and 98-2621-M-002-023.",auto-logistic regression; artificial neural networks; landscape metrics; empirical land-use change model,10.1080/13658811003752332,Article,URBAN-GROWTH; CELLULAR-AUTOMATA; CHANGE SCENARIOS; FOREST FRINGE; USE PATTERNS; DYNAMICS; GIS; DEFORESTATION; MANAGEMENT; RESOLUTION,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE,106,25,ISI,NATL TAIWAN UNIV;NATL CHUNG HSING UNIV;VRIJE UNIV AMSTERDAM,NATL TAIWAN UNIV,A
2013.0,Int. J. Geogr. Inf. Sci.,Spatial interpolation using MLPRBFN hybrid networks,Yeh I;Huang K;Kuo Y,"It is easy for a multi-layered perception (MLP) to fit a stratified spatial interpolation pattern whose form is close to open surface; while it is easy for a radial basis function network (RBFN) to fit a pocket (radial) spatial interpolation pattern whose form is close to closed surface. However, in the real world, the spatial interpolation pattern may consist of stratified and pocket patterns. Neither MLP nor RBFN can fit the pattern easily. To combine their advantages to fit the complex hybrid spatial interpolation patterns, in this article we propose a novel neural network, MLP-RBFN hybrid network (MRHN), whose hidden layer contains sigmoid and Gaussian units at the same time. Although there are two kinds of processing units in MRHN, in this study we used the principle of minimizing the error sum of squares to derive the supervised learning rules for all the network parameters. This research took rainfall distribution in Taiwan as a case study. The results show that (1) the prediction error of the testing dataset outside the training dataset demonstrated that MRHN was the most accurate among the three networks, RBFN was the next best, and MLP was the worst; (2) the MLP model seriously underestimated the values of high observed rainfall; (3) over-learning may be a serious shortcoming of using RBFN in spatial interpolation applications; (4) MRHN may have better generalization learning capacity than RBFN in spatial interpolation applications.","Tamkang Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.;  Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Taipei 11623, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,,"Huang, KC (corresponding author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.","National Science Council, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [NSC-100-2221-E-032-070]","The authors would like to thank the National Science Council, Taiwan, for supporting this research under contract no.

However, the diversity of existing algorithms may lead to significant differences in the extraction of geomorphological properties. Therefore, preliminary knowledge about these approaches is necessary. In this study, the five most widely used methods - the D8, D infinity, MD infinity, D4, and MD8 algorithms - for flow-direction determination were implemented to investigate watershed extent, water mass contribution, and the track of the longest watercourse. Distinctions of these properties should affect subsequent applications of hydrological analyses, such as the time of concentration calculation and peak discharge estimation. For an example case in Taiwan, the watershed extent and the longest watercourse obtained from the multiple-direction (MD8) algorithm could reach 1.2 and 1.8 times, respectively, that derived from the single-direction (D8) algorithm; moreover, the multiple-direction (MD8) algorithm manifested the weakest ability of collecting water mass from the watershed.

Twelve sampling locations were installed of southern Kaohsiung Harbor to collect sediment samples for analyzing Cr. Results showed that the Cr concentrations varied from 13.4-265.7 mg/kg with an average of 53.2±71.2 mg/kg. The spatial distribution of Cr reveals that the Cr concentration is relatively high in the river mouth region, especially in Jen-Gen River, and gradually diminishes toward the harbor entrance region. This indicates that upstream industrial and municipal wastewater discharges along the river bank are major sources of Cr pollution. Results from the enrichment factor and geo-accumulation index analyses imply that the sediments collected from the river mouth can be characterized between severe and very severe degree enrichment and between moderately strong and strong to very strong accumulation of Cr, respectively.

After the new demarcation of administrative areas, the influx and construction of industrial zones and commercial buildings has caused a major change of the original landscape in the Dadu hill area in Taichung City, Taiwan. The aims of this study are to provide recommendations pertaining the design of ecological corridors to improve the connectivity of the remaining green places, and the assessment of the health of habitat for the developed urban area. We compared the biodiversity (birds, mammals, plantation) and carbon flux in three different suburban areas including a campus, a metropolitan park and an undeveloped woodland in regular disturbance by human and fire. According to the results of habitat similarity, the metropolitan park and campus were grouped with the higher diversity of birds, but the woodland had the higher diversity of plantation and mammals. Seasonal change is the main factor which affects the carbon flux and vegetation growth situation, and the disturbance by human activities and canopy and coverage by plantation are the causes of fluctuations. The habitat assessment which integrated the biodiversity and carbon flux provided another angle to evaluate the greenbelt design comprehensively.

Unfortunately, the equipment used for inspections the inspection data lacks follow-up applications and numerical conversions, such as the Pavement Condition Index (PCI), to compile a large-scale database to facilitate the long-term conservation of roads. In this study, this paper developed back-end image recognition software using existing road inspection methods and existing equipment. This was aimed at enhancing inspection efficiency by enabling the automatic identification of road damage. Resulting observations can then be converted into PCI values in accordance with ASTM D6433-16 to be exported as a numeric value indicative of road quality. A vehicle-mounted traffic recorder and imaging device with Wi-Fi transmission capability are used as hardware, and the relationship between the captured images and the speed of the car is used to obtain an accurate indication of road conditions across the surface. The simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) Superpixels algorithm is used to identify areas with pavement damage as patches, potholes, longitudinal cracking, and crocodile cracking. The results of the proposed fully-automated method conform strongly with those obtained using semi-automated pavement inspection software. Despite the restrictions imposed by the limited depth measurement of 2D images, our method achieved results close to those obtained using manual inspection. Future developments will include the application of artificial intelligence to enhance the effectiveness of this software. © 2020, Int.

2017.0,Int. J. Geomech.,How small strain stiffness and yield surface affect undrained excavation predictions,Hsieh Y;Dang P;Lin H,"This paper discusses how small-strain stiffness and some aspects of the yield surface affect the finite-element predictions of excavation responses, including wall and ground deformations. By using the in-house-developed constitutive model SC1SS, it is possible to isolate and quantify impacts brought about by selected aspects of the soil behavior. This soil model has been validated to reasonably model Taipei silty clay and deep excavations in such soil. This study shows that ignoring small-strain stiffness can overestimate deformations by as much as 80%, leading to conservative and costly design. Inclined yield surface and Lode-angle dependency (on deviatoric planes) have lesser effects on the prediction results. In addition, the mechanisms behind these impacts are investigated through numerical triaxial tests. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Dept. of Civil and Construction Engineering, National Taiwan Univ. of Science and Technology, Taipei, 106, Taiwan; Golder Associates (Singapore) Pte.

2021.0,Int. J. Geomech.,Evaluating Influence of Microscopic Properties on Mechanical Behavior of Gravelly Soils by Using DiscreteElement Method,Ho T;Weng M,"Amidst the rapid development of the metropolitan area in Taichung, Taiwan, the mass rapid transit system (MRT) exemplifies a green public transportation project that helps minimize road traffic and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, managing the engineering of gravelly soils during MRT construction is challenging. This study adopted the discrete-element method software PFC2D to investigate the influence of microscopic properties on the mechanical performance of gravelly soils. Triaxial test data relating to gravelly soils with pure shear stress paths were analyzed to realize the mechanical behavior. The specimens were classified into Groups A and B based on the matrix properties, with and without cohesion. The simulation adopted two types of contact models to reflect gravelly soil matrix properties, which demonstrated reasonable agreement with the test results. After validating the proposed numerical model with a series of triaxial tests of gravelly soil under different confining pressures, this study investigated the influences of the micro parameters of porosity, friction coefficient, bond strength, and normal and shear stiffness of gravels and matrix on the mechanical behavior of gravelly soils. The results indicated that the main factors for Group A were the friction coefficient and effective modulus between particles. For Group B, the friction coefficient and bonding effective modulus were the main factors. The shear strength of gravelly soils increased when the friction coefficient, effective modulus, and bonding effective modulus increased.","Natl Yang Ming Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Hsinchu 30010, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,1.0,"Weng, MC (corresponding author), Natl Yang Ming Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Hsinchu 30010, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and Technology, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 106-2625-M-390-001, MOST 107-2625-M-009-010, MOST 108-2628-E-009-004-MY3]","This research was financially supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan under Contract MOST 106-2625-M-390-001, MOST 107-2625-M-009-010, and MOST 108-2628-E-009-004-MY3.",DEM; Gravelly soil; Microscopic factor; Triaxial test,10.1061/(ASCE)GM.1943-5622.0002178,Article,DEFORMATION CHARACTERISTICS; SHEAR-STRENGTH; TRIAXIAL TESTS; SIMULATION; MODEL; DEM; SANDSTONE; SCALE,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMECHANICS,0,21,ISI,NATL YANG MING CHIAO TUNG UNIV,NATL YANG MING CHIAO TUNG UNIV,B2
2006.0,Int. J. Numer. Anal. Methods Geomech.,Effects of anisotropic permeability on stabilization and pore water pressure distribution of poorly cemented stratified rock slopes,Dong J;Tzeng J;Wu P;Lin M,"Slopes composed of stratified and poorly cemented rocks that fail during heavy rainfalls are typical in the outer zone of Taiwan's Western Foothills. This study investigates how hydraulic conductivity anisotropy influences pore water pressure (PWP) distributed in stratified, poorly cemented rock slopes and related slope stability through numerical simulation. The notion of representing thin alternating beds of stratified, poorly cemented rocks as an equivalent anisotropic medium for groundwater flow analysis in finite slopes was validated. PWP was then derived in a modelled slope comprising an anisotropic medium with suitable boundary conditions. Simulation results indicate the significance of the principal directions of hydraulic conductivity tensor and the anisotropic ratio on PWP estimation for anisotropic finite slopes. For a stratified, poorly cemented rock slope, estimating PWP utilizing a phreatic surface with isotropic and hydrostatic assumptions will yield incorrect results. Stability analysis results demonstrate that hydraulic conductivity anisotropy affects the slope safety factor and slip surface pattern. Consequently, steady-state groundwater flow analysis is essential for stratified, poorly cemented rock slopes when evaluating PWP distribution and slope stability. This study highlights the importance of hydraulic conductivity anisotropy on the stability of a stratified, poorly cemented rock slope.

2007.0,Int. J. Numer. Anal. Methods Geomech.,Applying discontinuous deformation analysis to assess the constrained area of the unstable Chiufenerhshan landslide slope,Wu J,"Chiu-fen-erh-shan landslide is a remarkable slope failure occurred during the Chi-Chi earthquake in 1999. In November of 2002, abnormal geomorphologic features, including buckling and ground subsidence, were observed on the lower slope of the Chiu-fen-erh-shan landslide. This study attempts to assess the constrained area of a future collapsing on the slope using a dynamic discrete numerical analysis method, discontinuous deformation analysis (DDA). The simulation results show that the depression in front of the toe of the slope provides a space for arresting the whole sliding rocks when only the unstable lower slope fails. However, as the whole slope slides, the rock fragments move farther into the memorial park and can impact other facilities resulting in the enlarging of constrained area. The authority should prohibit people from entrancing the constrained area in the rainy season.

The flow rule used in the MIT-E3 model and viscoplasticity theory is employed in the derivation. The model adopts the yield surface capable of representing the yield behavior of the Taipei silty clay and assumes that it is initially symmetric about the K0-line. A method is then developed to compute the gyration and expansion of the loading surface to simulate the anisotropic behavior due to the principal stress rotation after shear. There are 11 parameters required for the model to describe the soil behavior and six of them are exactly the same as those used in the Modified Cam-clay model. The five additional parameters can be obtained by parametric studies or conventional soil tests, such as consolidation tests, triaxial compression and extension tests. Finally, verification of the model for the anisotropic behavior, creep behavior and the rate-dependent undrained stress-strain and shear strength of the Taipei silty clay is conducted. © 2010 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.","Department of Construction Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taiwan; Trinity consulting firm, Taipei, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,,"Ou, C.Y.; Department of Construction Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: ou@mail.ntust.edu.tw",,NA NA NA,Constitutive law;  Rate dependent;  Taipei silty clay;  Viscoplastic,10.1002/nag.948,Article,Anisotropic behaviors;  Consolidation tests;  Constitutive law;  Creep behaviors;  Flow rules;  Loading surface;  Modified Cam-clay model;  Parametric study;  Principal stress rotation;  Rate dependent;  Silty clay;  Soil behaviors;  Soil tests;  Stress paths;  Stress-strain;  Triaxial compression;  Undrained;  Undrained shear strength;  Viscoplastic;  Viscoplasticity theory;  Yield behaviors;  Yield surface; Anisotropy;  Creep;  Shear strength;  Soil testing;  Stress analysis; Geologic models; anisotropy;  modeling;  shear strength;  silty clay;  soil mechanics;  stress-strain relationship;  viscoplasticity; Taipei;  Taiwan,,International Journal for Numerical and Analytical Methods in Geomechanics,6,35,scopus,NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,NOTREPORTED,A

Tunnels constructed in these formations along the Northern Second Highway around Taipei area, have encountered some serious failures during construction. One of the tunnels that experienced squeezing failure and the resulting massive cave-in is evaluated and analyzed in this study, to reveal the actual causes of such failure. To understand the causes and related mechanisms of the failed case, numerical analyses utilizing the distinct element method were used. Furthermore, the impacts of the overburden on the tunnel failure modes are analyzed, to simulate the different tunnel sections. The failure of the Pitan Tunnel may have initiated from the flexural tensile buckling of the interbedded formation located at the right sidewall. Sliding of the roof rocks along the bedding planes and shearing failure of the formation at the left sidewall, occurred subsequently. For the same thickness of the formation, a smaller spacing will have a wider buckling range. The location of the interbedded formation also greatly affects the stability of the tunnel. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.","Chaoyang University of Technology, Taichung, Taiwan",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,0.0,"Hsu, S.C.; Chaoyang University of Technology, Taichung, Taiwan; 電子郵件: schsu@mail.cyut.edu.tw",,NA NA,Discontinuity dip;  Failure mechanism;  Numerical analysis;  Shale;  Squeezing;  Tunnel,10.1016/j.ijrmms.2004.03.117,Article,Bending strength;  Buckling;  Concrete construction;  Mining engineering;  Numerical analysis;  Sandstone;  Thickness measurement;  Tunnels; Bedding planes; Rock mechanics; failure analysis;  numerical model;  sandstone;  shale;  tunnel;  weak rock,Elsevier BV,International Journal of Rock Mechanics and Mining Sciences,16,41,scopus,CHAOYANG UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY,CHAOYANG UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY;電子郵件: SCHSU@MAIL.CYUT.EDU.TW,B1
2009.0,Int. J. Rock Mech. Min. Sci.,Dynamic discrete analysis of an earthquakeinduced largescale landslide,Wu J;Lin J;Chen C,"The Chiu-fen-erh-shan landslide, estimated to have a volume of 36 million cubic meters, was triggered by the M-W 7.6 Taiwan Chi-Chi earthquake of 1999. The debris covered an area of 1.95 km(2) and claimed 36 lives. During the sliding, the landslide mass disintegrated with its debris acquiring high speeds to reach over 1 km of travel distance. The main objectives of the study were to investigate if it was possible to numerically model the landslide progression, including slope disintegration, and to reproduce the post-failure configuration. Toward these goals, the study employed a discrete element method called discontinuous deformation analysis for the dynamic analysis. By incorporating the spacing and orientation information of the joints and bedding planes, the slope was modeled as an assemblage of discrete deformable blocks. Horizontal and vertical ground motions were simultaneously applied. The near-field digital strong records were affected by the large uplift of the hanging wall of the reverse thrust fault and corrections were made to address this issue. The study showed that the methodology adopted was able to capture essential characteristics of the landslide and gave a post-failure configuration resembling that observed in the field.

Sci.,Stressdependence of the permeability and porosity of sandstone and shale from TCDP HoleA,Dong J;Hsu J;Wu W;Shimamoto T;Hung J;Yeh E;Wu Y;Sone H,"We utilize an integrated permeability and porosity measurement system to measure the stress dependent permeability and porosity of Pliocene to Pleistocene sedimentary rocks from a 2000m borehole. Experiments were conducted by first gradually increasing the confining pressure from 3 to 120 MPa and then subsequently reducing it back to 3 MPa. The permeability of the sand stone remained within an arrow range (10(-14)-10(-13)m(2)). The permeability of the shale was more sensitive to the effective confining pressure(varying by two to three orders of magnitude) than the sand stone, possibly due to the existence of microcracks in the shale. Meanwhile, the sandstone and shale showed a similar sensitivity of porosity to effective pressure, where by porosity was reduced by about 10-20% when the confining pressure was increased from 3 to 120 MPa. The experimental results indicate that the fit of the models to the data points can be improved by using a power law instead of an exponential relationship. To extrapolate the permeability or porosity under larger confining pressure (e.g. 300 MPa) using a straight line in a log-log plot might induce unreasonable error, but might be adequate to predict the stress dependent permeability or porosity within the experimental stress range. Part of the permeability and porosity decrease observed during loading is irreversible during unloading. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

2013.0,Int. J. Rock Mech. Min. Sci.,Investigation of the HsienduShan rock avalanche caused by typhoon Morakot in 2009 at Kaohsiung county Taiwan,Wu J;Chen J;Lu C,"The Hsien-du-shan rock avalanche at Kaohsiung County, Taiwan, was triggered by heavy rainfall brought by Typhoon Morakot in 2009. Heavy rainfall began on the day of August 6, and continued to the morning of August 9 when the slope failure and landslide occurred. In this post-event investigation, physical, mechanical, and hydraulic properties of the rocks/soils at this large landslide site are evaluated. The in situ hydraulic conductivity of the soils at the source area was found to be too low (k=1.48 x 10(-6) m/s) for rainfall to vertically infiltrate to the deep sliding surface, which was found to have a maximum depth of 85.6 m. The post-failure simulations using discontinuous deformation analysis (DDA) suggest that the geometry of the sliding surface governs the failure behavior, and two continuous progressing failures likely occurred at the beginning of the Hsien-du-shan rock avalanche. Slope deformation was observed by the local residents before the Hsien-du-shan rock avalanche occurred as a geomorphologic precursor. In addition, water accumulation along the sliding surface governs the behavior of the sliding surface. Therefore, in the future, an early warning system of a rock avalanche can be developed by simultaneously applying high-resolution airborne LiDAR to detect slope deformation and using geo-electric measurements to image the infiltration of surface water to the sliding surface.

2007.0,Int. J. Sediment Res.,Estimation of soil erosion in a reservoir watershed using Cs137 fallout radionuclide,Chiu Y;Borghuis A;Lee H;Chang K;Chao J,"Sedimentation from soil erosion is a critical reservoir watershed management issue. Due to the difficulty of field investigations, empirical formulas are commonly used to estimate the soil erosion rate. However, these estimations are often far from accurate. An effective alternative to estimating soil erosion is to analyze the spatial variation of Cs-137 inventory in the soil. Cs-137 can be adsorbed by the soil and is widely assumed to change its distribution only when disturbed by rainfall and human activities. Thus, 137Cs distributed in soils can be a useful environmental tracer to estimate soil erosion. In this study, the net soil loss estimate is 108,346 t/yr and the gross erosion and net erosion rates are 10.1 and 9 t/ha yr respectively. The sediment delivery ratio is therefore estimated to be 0.9 baked on the two erosion rates. Because of the steep hillsides in the watershed, only 10% of the sediment yield stayed in the deposition sites and 90% was transported to the river as the sediment output. Soil erosion estimates from spatial variations of the Cs-137 activity in the Baishi river watershed showed satisfactory accuracy when compared to sediment yield data. Using Soil Cs-137 concentrations is therefore a feasible method for estimating soil loss or deposition in Taiwan. Data sampling, analysis and result of this approach are given in this paper.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Taipei 10764, Taiwan.;  Univ Utrecht, Dept Phys Geog, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Taipei 10764, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Hydraul Res Lab, Taipei 10764, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geog, Taipei 10764, Taiwan.;  Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Nucl Sci & Technol Dev Ctr, Hsinchu, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;NETHERLANDS;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,5,1.0,,"Chiu, YJ (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Taipei 10764, Taiwan.",,,soil erosion; radionuclide Cs-137; Baishi watershed; spatial distribution; sediment yield,,Article,CESIUM-137 MEASUREMENTS; RATES; TAIWAN; FOREST; BASIN,IRTCES,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SEDIMENT RESEARCH,8,22,ISI,NATL TAIWAN UNIV;UNIV UTRECHT;NATL TAIWAN UNIV;NATL TAIWAN UNIV;NATL TAIWAN UNIV;NATL TSING HUA UNIV,NATL TAIWAN UNIV,X
2009.0,Int. J. Sediment Res.,Variability in rainfall threshold for debris flow after the ChiChi earthquake in central Taiwan China,Shieh C;Chen Y;Tsai Y;Wu J,"The purpose of this study is to analyze variability in rainfall threshold for debris flow (critical rainfall for debris flow triggering) after the M-L 7.3 Chi-Chi earthquake in central Taiwan in 1999. Two study sites with different geological conditions were surveyed in the earthquake area. Streambed surveys were conducted to continuously monitor debris flows between 1999 and 2006. During the 7-year study period, every debris flow event was identified, and the streambed characterized. Results show that the rainfall threshold for debris flow was remarkably lower just after the Chi-Chi Earthquake, but gradually recovered. To date, this rainfall threshold is still lower than the original level prior to the earthquake. This variability in rainfall threshold is closely related to the amount of sediment material in the initiation area of debris flow, which increased rapidly due to landslides resulting from the earthquake. With the increase in sediment material, the rainfall threshold was lowered severely during the first year following the Chi-Chi earthquake. However, heavy rainfalls mobilized the sediment material, causing debris flows and transporting sediment downstream. With the decrease in sediment material, the rainfall threshold recovered gradually over time. Furthermore, debris flows occurred only in the subbasins that had sufficient sediment material to cause significant movement. Hence, these results confirm that the sediment material in the initiation area of debris flow is a crucial component of the rainfall threshold for debris flow.","Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Hydraul & Ocean Engn, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.;  Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,4,1.0,0.0,"Chen, YS (corresponding author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Hydraul & Ocean Engn, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.",,,Debris flow; Rainfall threshold; Sediment material; Earthquake; Landslide,10.1016/S1001-6279(09)60025-1,Article,LANDSLIDES; DURATION,IRTCES,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SEDIMENT RESEARCH,105,24,ISI,NATL CHENG KUNG UNIV;NATL CHENG KUNG UNIV,NATL CHENG KUNG UNIV,B2

The rainfall characteristics factors that dominate peak suspended sediment concentration C-P are rainfall erosion factor R-ef, first peak rainfall intensity of area-average rainfall i(p1) and antecedent precipitation index I-ap; the rainfall characteristics factors that dominate suspended sediment yield Y-ss in storm events are total rainfall P, suspended sediment yield factor R-sf and antecedent precipitation index I-ap. This research focuses on watersheds in Liau-Kwei observation station along Lao-Nung River in southern Taiwan as the research object, and adopts the PSED-model to simulate the discharge hydrograph, suspended sediment concentration hydrograph and suspended sediment yield in 11 storm events for analysis. The analytical results show that there is a good correlation between the above-mentioned rainfall characteristics factors and C-P as well as Y-ss, thus enabling C-P and Y-ss to be predicted by using Expressions (13) and (14). These two expressions are utilized to predict C-P and Y-ss of Typhoon Morakot in 2009, and the results are compared with those from simulation by using the PSED-model. The result of comparison shows there is a good capability in predicting. For the watersheds where it is necessary to predict C-P and Y-ss of a storm event for the benefit of effective operation of water resource facilities, the aforesaid rainfall characteristics factors can be utilized to establish applicable models for prediction.","Nan Jeon Inst Technol, Dept Constructing Engn, Tainan 701, Taiwan.;  Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Hydraul & Ocean Engn, Tainan 701, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,,"Hsu, PC (corresponding author), Nan Jeon Inst Technol, Dept Constructing Engn, Tainan 701, Taiwan.",,,Lao-Nung River; Sediment; Peak suspended sediment concentration; PSED; Morakot,10.1016/S1001-6279(11)60084-X,Article,SOIL-EROSION MODEL; DRAINAGE-BASIN; TRANSPORT; DYNAMICS; SIMULATION; CATCHMENTS; RAINFALL; FLOW,IRTCES,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SEDIMENT RESEARCH,7,26,ISI,NAN JEON INST TECHNOL;NATL CHENG KUNG UNIV,NAN JEON INST TECHNOL,A

The model was calibrated and verified with field data collected from Nov. 8, 2002 to April 13, 2003. The RMA2 and TOXIWASP models were configured for the wetland system to model mass transport, suspended sediment as well as heavy metals. Hydrodynamic results from the RMA2 model were used to develop mass transport for the TOXIWASP model in the wetland system. Model results mimic the field data for suspended sediment and heavy metals. Results of model sensitivity analyses show that the partition coefficient is a key parameter for the fate and transport of heavy metals in the wetland system.","Natl Pingtung Univ Sci & Technol, Ctr Teaching Excellence, Pingtung 912, Taiwan.;  Univ Virginia, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Taipei 106, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Hydrotech Res Inst, Taipei 106, Taiwan.;  Natl Pingtung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Pingtung 912, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;USA;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,6,1.0,,"Yang, CP (corresponding author), Natl Pingtung Univ Sci & Technol, Ctr Teaching Excellence, Pingtung 912, Taiwan.","National Science Council of Taiwan, Republic of ChinaMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [NSC 90-2211-E-002-035, NSC 91-2211-E-002-066]","This research was supported by the National Science Council of Taiwan, Republic of China, under Grant Nos.

2013.0,Int. J. Sediment Res.,Dimension and frequency of bar formation in a braided river,An H;Chen S;Chan H;Hsu Y,"This paper presents flume and field observations of a bank-confined braided river. Morphological features, including plan form configuration, channel width, and main channel migration, were examined by a series of experiments. Repeated measurements of channel morphology, provided a basis to estimate the relationship between noncumulative frequency of bars and bar area. Additional results from the Dajia River, located in Central Western Taiwan, were presented to provide a reference data set for comparing the laboratory and field data. The results indicate that the relationship between bar length and width can be predicted by a simple best-fit power function relating to self-similarity characteristics. The Hurst index by Walsh and Hicks ( 2002) provides acceptable predictions of the bar length and width observed in the experiments and confirmed by the field investigations. Eexperimental and field results both show that large river width yields a uniform distribution of bar areas with the similar discharge, leading to a large value of exponent (beta) in the model. The river width is confirmed to be a critical parameter in the main channel shift. A small increase in channel width likely increased rapidly the shift cycle.","Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Soil & Water Conservat, Taichung 40227, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,4,1.0,,"An, HP (corresponding author), Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Soil & Water Conservat, 250 Guoguang Rd, Taichung 40227, Taiwan.",,,Braided river; Bank confinement; Bar morphology,10.1016/S1001-6279(13)60046-3,Article,CHANNEL; STREAM; FLOW,IRTCES,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SEDIMENT RESEARCH,8,28,ISI,NATL CHUNG HSING UNIV,NATL CHUNG HSING UNIV,A
2013.0,Int. J. Sediment Res.,Numerical study of the effects of check dams on erosion and sedimentation in the Pachang River,Hsieh H;Luo C;Yang J;Chen R,"Scouring and deposition processes resulting from variable rainfall and typhoon occurrence in tropical climatic conditions induce significant changes in the riverbeds of Taiwan. Along the Pachang River of western Taiwan, severe damage occurs during typhoons due to large and sudden variations in discharge, erosion, sediment transport and deposition. In order to simulate this process, the NETSTARS numerical modeling tool was used in the present paper. The influence of existing and planned check dam structures on flow control was also analyzed to determine their capacity to resist river erosion or to not be buried beneath sediments. Not only does the modeling tool allow calculation of the erosion-deposition behavior at the scale of the whole river, but it also provides local determination of the optimum location and characteristics such as foundation depth and lateral encroachment of future check dams. The results of a 10-year, long-term modeling simulation in terms of riverbed stability and scouring potential thus provide insights about unsafe future behavior at 4 sites. This numerical model provides a better general understanding and useful information for the optimal prevention of both the scouring damage and the burial related to sediment deposition with large changes in discharge and sediment transport.","Taiwan Shoufu Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Multimedia Design, Tainan, Taiwan.;  Natl Chi Nan Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Puli Township 545, Nanto County, Taiwan.;  Natl Chiayio Tung Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Hsinchu, Taiwan.;  Chinese Culture Univ, Dept Geol, Taipei, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,4,1.0,,"Hsieh, HM (corresponding author), Taiwan Shoufu Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Multimedia Design, Tainan, Taiwan.","Water Conservancy Bureau in Taiwan, China","This study was supported by the Water Conservancy Bureau in Taiwan, China.

2016.0,Int. J. Sediment Res.,Simulating bed evolution following the Barlin Dam Taiwan China failure with implications for sediment dynamics modeling of dam removal,Wang H;Tullos D;Kuo W,"The failure of the Barlin Dam in Taiwan, China offers an important case study for evaluating concepts in modeling the rapid erosion and channel recovery following intentional and unplanned dam removals. We present a modeling effort that applied a 1D and quasi-2D uncoupled hydraulics and sediment model (NETSTARS) to evaluate how discretization and parameterization influence thefitofbed elevationpredictions to observations following dam failure. Our analysis evaluated the model sensitivity to sediment transport function, active layer thickness, and number of stream tubes used to define the cross-section. Results indicate that a) the model is more sensitive to active layer thickness and sediment transport function than to the number of stream tubes, b) development of dam removal models are likely to benefit from varying the active layer thickness in time, and c) increased lateral discretization does not appear to improve model fit in the steep and rapidly changing river environment at our site. We conclude with discussion on differences between, identifying the need for, and general use of 1D, quasi-2D, and fully 2D models in dam removal and failure analysis.

2016.0,Interpretation,A study on tectonic and sedimentary development in the rifted northern continental margin of the South China Sea near Taiwan,Liao W;Lin A;Liu C;Oung J;Wang Y,"A series of Cenozoic rifted basins developed in the northern margin of the South China Sea (SCS). Tainan Basin is one of these rifted basins near Taiwan, lying in the outer margin. We have used reflection seismic data in the deepwater areas and boreholes drilled in the shelf of the Tainan Basin to understand the tectonic and sedimentary development in the northern SCS margin near Taiwan. Four key stratal surfaces (i.e., the base of the Pleistocene Series, the base of the Pliocene Series, the 17 Ma maximum flooding surface [MFS], and a breakup unconformity of approximately 30 Ma in age) and seven seismic facies (i.e., continuous-and parallel-layer seismic facies, wavy seismic facies, chaotic seismic facies, U-shaped canyon-cut seismic facies, imbricated-layer seismic facies, high-amplitude reflector package seismic facies, and extrusive volcanism seismic facies) are recognized from seismic data with ages constrained by borehole stratigraphy drilled in the shelf. We have established a model for Cenozoic tectonic and sedimentary development in the rifted northern margin of the SCS near Taiwan. The occurrence of Paleogene fault-bounded grabens/half-grabens topped by a breakup unconformity and draped by postrift sediments indicates that these deepwater rifted basins developed on the continental crust, attesting that a thinned continental crust underlies the deepwater study area, rather than oceanic crust as reported in some literature. Postbreakup extrusive volcanic bodies, of early Miocene age, were buried by thick deepwater sediments. Fairly continuous stratal surfaces of 17MaMFS reveal that volcanic activities ceased to be active since middle Miocene. A series of channel cut-and-fills is observed in late Miocene, Pliocene, and Pleistocene strata beneath and to the south of the modern Formosa Canyon. Two distinct fields of deepwater sediment waves developed since middle Pleistocene are found lying to the west of modern deformation front/Manila Trench and to the north and south of the Formosa Canyon, respectively.","Natl Cent Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Taoyuan, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, Taipei, Taiwan.;  CPC Corp, Taoyuan, Taiwan.;  MOEA, Cent Geol Survey, Taipei, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,5,1.0,,"Liao, WZ (corresponding author), Natl Cent Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Taoyuan, Taiwan.; Liao, WZ (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, Taipei, Taiwan.","Central Geological Survey, Ministry of Economic Affairs","We thank L.-Y.

2020.0,Interpretation,Seismic prediction of soil distribution for the ChangBin offshore wind farm in the Taiwan Strait,Han W;Lu Y;Lo S,"Direct soil measurements are limited to borehole locations and are therefore sparse in the oceans. To effectively characterize the soil distributions for the Chang-Bin offshore wind farm, which is an area with the greatest wind energy potential in the Taiwan Strait, we have developed a workflow to predict the soil distribution in the subsurface based on integrated analysis of seismic data and borehole data. First, we characterize the key seismic units and their seismic response in order to understand the regional stratigraphy. Then, we correlate the soil es to each stratigraphic unit as the constraint for the input and quality control to train a neural network based on seismic multiattribute analysis. Finally, we develop a neural network that is suitable for soil prediction in the Chang-Bin offshore wind farm. Five seismic units identified from the seismic profiles reveal that the regional stratigraphy has been greatly affected by sea-level change and the sediment transportation process. Confirmed by independent in situ borehole data, the neural network is considered reliable up to 60 m below the seafloor, whereas decreased signal-to-noise ratios at greater depths lead to poorer prediction accuracy. Compared to previous studies that mainly are based on high-quality 3D seismic and well logging data, our method can predict the soil distribution by analyzing 2D seismic profiles and simplified soil layers alone. The prediction results reveal detailed lithologic variations that are tested by in situ borehole measurements. Therefore, we are confident that this approach could effectively obtain the soil distribution prediction and thus reduce the costs in offshore engineering applications.","Ind Technol Res Inst, Green Energy & Environm Res Labs, Tainan 71150, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,,"Han, WC (corresponding author), Ind Technol Res Inst, Green Energy & Environm Res Labs, Tainan 71150, Taiwan.","Bureau of Energy, Ministry of Economic Affairs [108-D0107, 109-D0107]","We acknowledge the Bureau of Energy, Ministry of Economic Affairs for the financial support of the research project (no. 108-D0107 and 109-D0107).

The electrokinetic (EK) treatment process is a useful remedial technology, particularly for soil with low permeability. This pilot test farm implements EK technology to remove heavy metal Cd from the silty loam in rice paddies, and evaluates the removal efficiency of the Cd, as well as soil fertility enhancement during the EK treatment process. A citric acid-surfactant mixture was used as the treatment solution, applied under an electrical current, to improve the removal of the Cd, while simultaneously enhancing the fertility of the silty farm soil. The test results revealed that the EK process gained a Cd removal efficiency of 76.6%; in addition, the contents of organic matter, total nitrogen, Bray-1 phosphorus, and exchangeable potassium and magnesium were relatively elevated after 92 days of treatment duration. This study concluded that the on-farm EK treatment technology would be capable of mitigating soil contaminated with not only heavy metals, but also organic compounds in the future.

Increasing demand for water emphasizes the proper need for effective planning and development of irrigated resources. A groundwater simulation model was performed to construct the hydrogeological structure of the regional Pingtung Plain in the southwest part of Taiwan and the optimal withdrawal of three irrigation areas in Pingtung Plain was analysed. The optimal ratios for allocating water of three canals are analysed in this research. The optimal distribution rate of each canal depends on the season, irrigation methods and crops, which are two paddy rice and one upland crop. After simulation of various scenarios, optimal simulation results show that the minimal amount of required groundwater and the maximum amount of excess water amounts in the area can be satisfied by current agricultural practices.

2009.0,Irrig. Drain.,WHO BENEFITS FROM ALLOCATING AGRICULTURAL WATER TO OTHER SECTORS IN TAIWAN,Tan Y;Lai J;Adhikari K;Lu A,"This paper presents a historical account of Taiwan's irrigated agriculture in the face of the nation's changing water resource policy and developing economy. The pre-World War II era marked the beginning of water resource development on a scientific basis, particularly during the Japanese colonial era. Building on previous developments, the modern era brought policies for improved access to production resources in the interests of interdisciplinary society. Water resources took a sharp turn from supply to demand management in order to respond to the industrial and domestic sectors. The farmers who were once the major beneficiary of irrigated agriculture were unable to sustain their agricultural economy. As an alternative to water resource production, rainwater harvesting by so-called ""water-planting"" on paddy fields evolved, among others, as a major policy drive to curb the water supply problem. Calculations show that this would leave more than 200 000 ha of fallowed paddy fields each year, and management must be aware of unforeseen negative externalities due to such practices. Despite the reduced share of water in irrigated agriculture, import and export transactions from agricultural commodities even after joining the World Trade Organization (WTO) are not discouraging. Efficient use and water saving appear to be the keys to balancing supply and demand to help secure the water economy, increase domestic food reserves, and contribute to social justice.

Currently, there are no design solutions in Taiwan for restoration of the banks that are based on solid scientific information. This research assesses the habitats and behavioral characteristics of seven amphibian species in order to learn how to better manage irrigation and drainage banks. This study evaluated the amphibians' motility on five different bank slopes, and documented the relationship between species' climbing abilities, the surface substrates of banks, and seasonal variations in weather conditions. The results showed that even species in the same family or with similar body size differ in their behavioral performance. The experimental results of this study can aid technicians in future engineering projects that involve irrigation and drainage banks in Taiwan and around the world.

As flooding issues nowadays are more complicated and should be discussed taking multidisciplinary considerations into account, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of land use changes on flooding, landscape pattern, and ecological resources as a whole, based on past environmental changes and trends in future development, using the concept of the Landscape Ecological Decision and Evaluation Support System Model (LEDESS). Yunlin County, one of the demonstration sites of the Regulation Project of Flood-Prone Areas, proposed by the Water Resource Agency of Taiwan in 2005, was studied. We designed three scenarios, i.e. Scenario A for the current situation, Scenario B for the government policy, and Scenario C as a sustainable policy integrating room for water. We used people, planet, and profit as the indicators to understand the consequences under different scenarios. The results indicated that lots of land will be abandoned in the near future due to flooding regardless of whether or not mitigation measures are adopted. That is to say, the coastal area will turn into a wetland area through natural processes. Hence, we need to reconsider land use strategy.

The spatial dimension of sustainability engages relations between different land uses, ecosystems, and human effects at different scales and over time. Yunlin County, located in south-western Taiwan, has abundant natural resources but has been suffering from flooding and land subsidence for a long time. With the effects of climate change, lowland management in this area is becoming complicated. Possible strategies should thus be considered and conveyed to decision-makers in the most efficient and transparent way, so as to redirect further discussion towards the conflicting aspects. The study evaluated the possible consequences of three planning scenarios on safety, economic, and ecological resources as a whole based on the future developing trend. The scenarios were then compared by applying OSIRIS, a decision and evaluation support system, to highlight the conflicting sites and to propose an optimal strategy. The results illustrated that the current lowland management policy is not effective and sustainable. Instead, the Coastal Conservation Green Way scenario might not only ease flood threat but also provide ecological benefit. The study could thus contribute to enhanced communication between stakeholders and help achieve sustainable lowland management.

During the field surveys of the study area, onboard surface to bottom CTD (conductivity, temperature, depth) profiling, ADCP (Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler) measurements, and fluorescence profiling were carried out at 25 different stations. The collected hydrographic data were used to identify a suspected SGD site in the central part of the study area, where a local drop of salinity by up to 0.06 psu has been observed in the lowermost 0.2 similar to 1.5 m of the water column. Thanks to explicit evidence for a possible pathway and locations, seepage meters were deployed on the sea bed to measure the SGD rate at about 6.0 ml h(-1) m(-2) in the dry season. Based on the surveyed data, the likely locations of the SGD sources in the study area were specified, all of which were restricted to the inner shelf at a depth less than 8 m.

The results clearly indicate that smaller mean grain size and elevated mud content are observed close to Anping Harbor and fishing port. Grain-size normalized metal concentrations show large spatial variation, and metal distributions in the Tainan coastal sediments are clearly affected by terrestrial river inputs based on the locations of elevated metal concentrations. Heavy metal concentrations in the Tainan Canal sediments are significantly higher than those from the offshore area. Moreover, elevated I-geo (geo-accumulation index) values also indicate that the Canal sediments were either moderately or strongly contaminated with Zn and Hg. The varying metal concentrations in sediments near the mouth of Anping Harbor with data from December 2002 to January 2005, suggest no clear trends during phases I and II of dredging of the canal and no abnormal concentrations occurred during the dredging period. This result indicates that the metal contaminated sediments are trapped in the canal and then been removed during dredging. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Les resultats indiquent clairement que les grains de la plus petite taille moyenne et les teneurs en boues les plus elevees sont observes a proximite du port d'Anping et du port de peche. Les concentrations de metaux normalisees a la taille granulometrique montrent une grande variation spatiale: les distributions de metaux dans les sediments cotiers sont clairement affectees par les apports fluviaux terrestres, bases sur l'emplacement des concentrations elevees de metaux. Les concentrations de metaux lourds dans les sediments du canal Tainan sont nettement plus elevees que celles de la zone offshore. En outre, les valeurs iGeo elevees (indice geo-accumulation) indiquent egalement que les sediments du canal sont moderement ou fortement contamines par Zn et Hg. Les variations temporelles de concentrations de metaux differents dans les sediments pres de l'embouchure du port d'Anping (donnees de decembre 2002 a janvier 2005) ne suggerent aucune tendance claire au cours des phases I et II du dragage du canal, et aucune concentration anormale ne s'est produite au cours des periodes de dragage.

2015.0,Irrig. Drain.,A PRELIMINARY STUDY ON THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE ECOLOGICAL CORRIDOR IN PADDY FIELDS,Chen R;Wang K;Wu C,"The ecological engineering of rivers has been emphasized in recent years; however, scant attention has been focused on the ecological environments of paddy fields and irrigation canals. In this study, a paddy field in Yuanli Township, Miaoli County, Taiwan, was used as a test field. We improved the ecological corridor, ensuring the continuity of the irrigation canal and paddy field, thereby enabling a constant flow of water in the longitudinal section of the paddy field corridor to facilitate smooth upstream migration of fish. Fish could also migrate upstream in the lateral section of the paddy field. Subsequently, loach were used to assess the effect of an enhanced rock pile in a pool area of the simplified paddy fishway, and fish were allowed to migrate up and down the paddy field and irrigation canal. The results indicated that the difference in water levels (i.e. a bottleneck for creating an ecological corridor) was enhanced by the simplified paddy-field fishway and enhanced rock pile. In addition, removing bottlenecks along the ecological corridor enabled fish and shrimp to migrate in the longitudinal and lateral directions. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

2015.0,Irrig. Drain.,Effects of Reclaimed Water on the Growth and Fruit Quality of Cucumber,Chen F;Liu C,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using reclaimed water for cucumber irrigation. The experiment was conducted using raw canal water, and water reclaimed from treated wastewater using a natural recycling treatment system. The raw water quality met the Irrigation Water Quality Standards of Taiwan. The water quality of reclaimed water was treated within the ranges of DO: 3.9-8.4 (mg l(-1)); pH: 6.5-7.8; EC: 206-587 (mu s cm(-1), 25 degrees C); SS: 0.1-11.8 (mg l(-1)); NH4-N: 0-18.16 (mg l(-1)) and BOD: 0.1-1.8 (mg l(-1)). The experimental period for cucumber growth was 75 days. R-g was defined as the different multiple of plant growth and used to estimate the effects of irrigation water quality. Furthermore, yield, weight, length, and diameter of cucumbers were used to quantify the influence of irrigation water quality on cucumber quality. Result shows that R-g was within the range (1.003-1.311). The heights of cucumbers grown using reclaimed water were longer than those grown using raw water. Comparing the yield, weight, length, and diameter of cucumbers irrigated by reclaimed water (RW) and by raw water (IW), the percentages of RW/IW were respectively 154, 96, 95.5 and 101%. Based on the results, this study concludes that using reclaimed water for cucumber irrigation is feasible.

2015.0,Irrig. Drain.,RainfallRunoff Research on Upland Fields and A Comparison Of Kinematic Wave and Improved Tank Models,Chen R;Yang K;Chang S,"Taiwan is a small, populous island. Because little flat land remains available for building, a trend in hillside development has recently been observed. During the storm season, especially during typhoons, heavy rainfall is common; however, the volume of rainfall is difficult to predict. Heavy precipitation causes flash floods as surface and groundwater levels overwhelm drainage systems. Thus people living on, or close to, hills are at risk of experiencing flooding with little warning. We investigated two models to discuss their differences and impact of rainfall in upland locations. The tank model describes and simulates the hydrology of an area, and the kinematic wave model simulates rainfall at upland locations. We used two natural rainfall events that occurred in the Tai-Chung basin as case studies for both models. We applied five statistical indexes, namely root mean squared error (RMSE), coefficient of efficiency (CE), percentage error of peak discharge (EQp), error in time to peak (ETp), and percentage error of total volume (EV) to evaluate and interpret hydraulic data and our simulation results. We determined both models to be applicable; the results showed the relative error in peak flow simulation for the upland tank model to be less than 10%. The total runoff forecasts for large-scale typhoon rainfall exhibited large errors in both models. Less severe rainfall events produced lower percentage errors in both models. The simulated hydrograph was compared with the measured hydrograph, and little difference was observed in the performance of the models. However, the simulation results of the kinematic wave model were slightly more favourable, possibly because the more complex wave model included more parameters representing physiographic factors, such as the river flow parameters P and K, equivalent roughness values of N, the average slope values, and the infiltration values, thus increasing the accuracy of the simulation. The upland tank model did not require complex physiographic factor parameters; instead, the Multistar-Powell method was used to model the upland tank model parameters to produce a simulated hydrograph, yielding results no less favourable than those produced using the kinematic wave model. In the absence of comprehensive measured data and physiographic factors, the upland tank model has practical uses.

2018.0,Irrig. Drain.,Assessment of Land Subsidence and Climate Change Impacts on Inundation Hazard in Southwestern Taiwan,Wang H;Lin C;Yang C;Ding C;Hwung H;Hsiao S,"Excessive extraction of groundwater resulting in serious land subsidence as well as intensified rainfall and storm surges due to climate change complicate the flooding problems in southwest Taiwan. A coupled set of different models was proposed to analyze the effect of inundation risk considering land subsidence and climate change. Three models, including the groundwater flow model, land subsidence model, and the physiographic drainage-inundation model, were used in this study, enabling simulations of different considerations. The results revealed that more severe flooding would result from land subsidence and climate change. The findings of a 21% increase in flood area with an inundation depth greater than 1.5m for 200-yr return period events clearly showed more severe flooding would result from land subsidence. The flooding in those severely subsiding areas would increase in a range from 3.4 to 21.5% when further considering climate change. While the simulation results revealed that the flood area could be decreased by as much as 50% taking into account the implemented policies, the coastal region would still be exposed to a high risk of being flooded. It thus suggests that policies focusing on infrastructure would be insufficient, and river basin management as well as spatial planning should be investigated further.

2018.0,Irrig. Drain.,WATER MANAGEMENT TO ENHANCE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES IN A COASTAL WETLAND IN TAIWAN,Kuo P;Wang H,"Wetlands provide multiple ecosystem services, and wetland hydrology is one of the key determinants of wetland function. Budai Salt Pan Wetland provides at least 11 ecosystem services, i.e. food provision, genetic materials, climate regulation, water purification and treatment, natural hazard regulation, pollination, spiritual and inspirational, recreational, aesthetic, educational and nutrient cycling. As the wetland is completely encompassed by dikes, there is no natural hydrological connectivity, and the wetland frequently dries out during the dry season due to lack of management and insufficient rainfall. In order to enhance wetland function, including habitat quality and ecosystem services, this study created a water management plan which mimics nature through water gate operation. We conducted experimental gate operations and evaluated the potential impacts on ecosystem services. The results show a positive impact on two of the ecosystem services, climate regulation and genetic materials, due to the increased moisture content and feeding bird individuals after gate operation. There was an insignificant change in the natural hazard regulation service as the gate operation tested in this study addressed issues of water supply rather than increasing detention space through draining. Through mimicking nature, sustainable water management techniques have the potential to enhance ecosystem services in wetlands.

2019.0,Irrig. Drain.,A SUITABLE DESIGN OF OUTLET TYPE FOR PADDIES IN TAIWAN BY EVALUATING THE FLOOD DETENTION EFFECT AND APPLICABILITY,Chen R;Cheng Y;Huang P,"This study intends to enhance a paddy's flood detention effect by adjusting the outlet mechanism to mitigate flooding. Since the paddy's detention effect is an additional function, this study focuses on figuring out a suitable design by comprehensively considering the inundation duration for rice, least peak discharge for flood detention and applicability for various ridge heights. This study establishes a water balance model by utilizing the outlet's discharge coefficients and loss intensity calibrated from the field test. The study adopts the shuffled complex evolution (SCE-UA) method to optimize the peak discharge. Based on the dimensions of the paddy ridges around the test field and a 24-h rainfall in a 50-year return period, both the orifice type and the overflow type perform well, with peak discharge = 0.0105 m(3) s?(1) and peak time = 960 min. Compared with the weir type, they function well in flood detention, with peak discharge reduction = 65.9% and detention time (time span between the peak time of the weir type and that of the others) = 200 min. Despite having the best performance in flood detention, the orifice type is the least applicable due to the limitation of ridge height. The overflow type has the advantages of both the weir and the orifice types. It is the most suitable design for paddies in Taiwan in terms of applicability and flood detention effect.

The models and algorithms are composed of: (i) a hydrologic model for ponding depth simulation in a paddy field; (ii) an optimization model for height design and depth determination in deepwater ponding irrigation; (iii) a real-coded genetic algorithm for solving the optimization model. The results show that the optimal bund wall height of the paddy field is 27.7 cm and the optimal discount ratio of re-irrigation depth (i.e. trigger depth divided by the upper limit of ponding depth) is 0.008 in Taiwan, with a unit net benefit of US$18 500 ha over bar (1). During the first crop-growing season (January to May) and the second (June to October), the benefit of groundwater recharge, flood mitigation, saved irrigation quantity and income of paddy rice of deepwater ponding irrigation is increased by 73, 13, 53 and 25% than those of shallow intermittent irrigation treatment, respectively.

1993.0,Isl. Arc,Strain segmentation and lateral membrane deformation rate of the subducted Ryukyu slab,Chiao L,"Abstract Focal mechanisms of intermediate‐depth earthquakes within the subducted Ryukyu slab indicate a systematic pattern of down‐dip extension in the northern part under Kyushu. These mechanisms switch rapidly around the Tokara channel to down‐dip compression in the southern part toward Taiwan. This intriguing pattern of strain segmentation, together with the differences between the slab geometry of the northern and southern parts, has raised the question of whether stress segmentation, as defined possibly by a tear fault, might exist in the slab. However the Ryukyu trench has a concave oceanward shape in the northern segment while it is convex in the southern oceanward part toward Taiwan. The inflection zone is located around the Tokara channel. The concept of Gaussian curvature of a curved surface suggests that the along‐arc variation of the geometric configuration of a subducted slab is related to the shape of the trench. This is in order to accommodate the lateral membrane deformation of the slab as the oceanic lithosphere subducts from a spherical shell to the geometry delineated by the Wadati‐Benioff zone. The membrane deformation regime of the subducted Ryukyu slab and its relation with the trench geometry was examined by assuming that the subduction be modelled by the flow field of a thin viscous sheet. A projection operator was utilized to compute the membrane strain‐rate tensor of an arbitrary non‐Euclidean surface. Numerical experiments indicated that the northern segment of the slab was dominated by lateral compression and down‐dip extension and the southern part by lateral extension and down‐dip compression. This transition is sharply located near the Tokara channel. These patterns were compatible with what had been observed from studies of focal mechanisms, suggesting that the strain segmentation might be controlled, at least in part, by the lateral membrane deformation within the slab due to the trench shape in this subduction zone. The slab geometry was predicted by minimizing the integrated total dissipation power; this revealed distinct features that were consistent with observations. This implies that the slab geometry may also be affected by the membrane deformation in a systematic fashion. Copyright © 1993, Wiley Blackwell.

Arc.,Some features of the arccontinent collision zone in the Ryukyu subduction system Taiwan Junction area,Karp B;Kulinich R;Shyu C;Wang C,"To the northeast of Taiwan, northwestward subduction of the Philippine Sea plate is occurring beneath the Eurasian plate along the Ryukyu Trench. The Ryukyu Trench, which is well defined along the northeastern part of the Ryukyu are, cannot be easily defined west of 123 degrees east. This is an area where the Gagua Ridge (whose origin is controversial) enters the trench from the south. On the basis of the marine geophysical survey data the following results have been obtained. The structural elements associated with the Ryukyu subduction system deform and partially disappear west of 123 degrees east. Among other things the Ryukyu Trench terminates close to the western slope of the Gagua Ridge. The Gagua Ridge is the result of tectonic heaping and is likely to be an uplifted sliver of oceanic crust. The interaction between the Ryukyu subduction system and the Taiwan collision zone encompasses a wide region from Taiwan to the longitude 124.5 degrees east. The Gagua Ridge is a boundary between the active deformation zone related to the collision in Taiwan and the West Philippine Basin. It is proposed that there is a tectonic zone that can be traced from the Okinawa Trough on the north to the southern termination of the Gagua Ridge on the south.","NATL TAIWAN UNIV,INST OCEANOG,TAIPEI 10764,TAIWAN.; NATL TAIWAN OCEAN UNIV,INST APPL PHYS,CHILUNG,TAIWAN.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,RUSSIA,4,1.0,1.0,"Karp, BY (corresponding author), PACIFIC OCEANOL INST,VLADIVOSTOK 690041,RUSSIA.",,,collision; Gagua; marine geophysical survey; Ryukyu; Taiwan; tectonics,10.1111/j.1440-1738.1997.tb00180.x,Article; Proceedings Paper,OKINAWA TROUGH; TECTONIC EVOLUTION; PLATE CONVERGENCE; SEISMIC REFRACTION; PHILIPPINE SEA; COASTAL RANGE; BASIN; PACIFIC; CRUSTAL; ORIGIN,BLACKWELL SCIENCE,ISLAND ARC,9,6,ISI,NATL TAIWAN UNIV;NATL TAIWAN OCEAN UNIV,PACIFIC OCEANOL INST,B2

Approximately 2 years later (July 2001), the Toraji typhoon brought a heavy rainstorm (650 mm rain/day) and triggered widespread landslides in central Taiwan and parts of eastern Taiwan. Approximately 10 000 Chi-chi earthquake-induced landslides and 6000 Toraji typhoon-related mass movements were delineated in an area of 2400 km(2) using Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT; French earth resource satellite) images. The landslide distribution could be closely related to the distribution of peak ground acceleration registered during the Chi-chi earthquake. The study area was composed of Tertiary sedimentary and metamorphic rocks, whose age and induration increased eastward. The earthquake-induced landslides were mostly distributed in the region between the Chelungpu Fault and the Lishan Fault to the east, whereas they were few in the region east of the Lishan Fault. The Toraji typhoon in 2001 severely damaged both regions that had been shattered by the Chi-chi earthquake in 1999. The occurrence of earthquake-induced landslides can be correlated with epicentral distance, and their occurrence has more influence from the rock type than from the ground motion.","Ind Technol Res Inst, Energy & Resources Lab R000, Hsinchu 310, Taiwan.; Council Agr, Soil & Water Conservat Bur, Osaka 540, Japan.; Tokyo Univ Agr & Technol, Tokyo 1838509, Japan.;",TAIWAN;JAPAN;JAPAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,6,1.0,1.0,"Wang, WN (corresponding author), Ind Technol Res Inst, Energy & Resources Lab R000, Chung Hsing Rd, Hsinchu 310, Taiwan.",,,Chi-chi earthquake; mass movement; Toraji typhoon,10.1046/j.1440-1738.2003.00400.x,Article,GEOMORPHOLOGICAL PRECURSORS,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING ASIA,ISLAND ARC,54,12,ISI,IND TECHNOL RES INST;COUNCIL AGR;TOKYO UNIV AGR AND TECHNOL,IND TECHNOL RES INST,B1

Three aspects of the hydrological changes are noticed. First, following the Chi-Chi earthquake, the lower aquifers beneath the Choshui River fan showed a significant shift in isotopic composition towards that of the surface water in the Choshui River, suggesting enhanced exchanges of water between the river and the groundwater. Second, in some wells, water levels and isotopic compositions in different aquifers converged to the same respective values during the Chi-Chi earthquake, suggesting coseismic exchanges of water between the different aquifers, which implies enhanced permeability due perhaps to the fracturing and breaching of aquitards between the aquifers.

Arc.,Paleoenvironments of the evolving Pliocene to early Pleistocene foreland basin in northwestern Taiwan An example from the Dahan River section,Pan T;Lin A;Chi W,"The overriding of the Luzon volcanic arc atop the underlying Chinese rifted-continental margin has caused the formation of the Taiwan mountain belts and a peripheral foreland basin west of the orogen since the late Miocene. In this study, lithofacies analysis and calcareous nannofossil biostratigraphic investigations of the Dahan River section in northwestern (NW) Taiwan were performed. Our results offer insights into the temporal evolution of the sedimentary environments and the competing effects of the sedimentation and basin tectonics of the NW Taiwan foreland basin from the Pliocene to early Pleistocene. Nannofossil biostratigraphic studies showed that the upper Kueichulin Formation and the overlying Chinshui Shale can be assigned to the NN15 biozone of the Pliocene age, and the Cholan Formation pertains to NN16-NN18 of the early Pleistocene. The NN15-NN16 boundary coincides roughly with the boundary of the Chinshui Shale and Cholan Formation. We recognized three major sedimentary environments in the studied foreland succession comprising the upper Kueichulin Formation, Chinshui Shale, Cholan Formation and Yangmei Formation, in ascending order. During the deposition of the upper Kueichulin Formation in the early Pliocene, the dominant environment was a wave- and tide-influenced open marine setting. During the late Pliocene, the environment deepened to an outer-offshore setting when the sediments of Chinshui Shale were accumulated. In the Pleistocene, the environment then shallowed to wave-dominated estuaries during the deposition of the lower Cholan Formation, and the basin was rapidly filled, generating a meandering and sandy braided river environment during the deposition of the upper Cholan to the Yangmei Formation. In summary, the evolution of sedimentary environments in the studied succession shows a deepening then a shallowing and coarsening upward trend during the period from the Pliocene to the Pleistocene, spanning the age from approximately 4 to 1 Ma.","Natl Cent Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Zhongli City 320, Taoyuan County, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,1.0,"Lin, ATS (corresponding author), Natl Cent Univ, Dept Earth Sci, 300 Zhongda Rd, Zhongli City 320, Taoyuan County, Taiwan.",Ministry of Science and Technology [NSC 102-3113-P-008 -009],"We thank Profs.

2017.0,ISPRS Int. Geo-Inf.,Comparison and Evolution of Extreme RainfallInduced Landslides in Taiwan,Wu C,"This study analyzed the characteristics of, and locations prone to, extreme rainfall-induced landslides in three watersheds in Taiwan, as well as the long-term evolution of landslides in the Laonong River watershed (LRW), based on multiannual landslide inventories during 2003-2014. Extreme rainfall-induced landslides were centralized beside sinuous or meandering reaches, especially those with large sediment deposition. Landslide-prone strata during extreme rainfall events were sandstone and siltstone. Large-scale landslides were likely to occur when the maximum 6-h accumulated rainfall exceeded 420 mm. All of the large-scale landslides induced by short-duration and high-intensity rainfall developed from historical small-scale landslides beside the sinuous or meandering reaches or in the source area of rivers. However, most of the large-scale landslides induced by long-duration and high-intensity rainfall were new but were still located beside sinuous or meandering reaches or near the source. The frequency density of landslides under long-duration and high-intensity rainfall was larger by one order than those under short-duration rainfall, and the values in the landslide frequency density-area analysis ranged from 1.22 to 1.348. The number of downslope landslides was three times larger than those of midslope and upslope landslides. The extreme rainfall-induced landslides occurred in the erosion gullies upstream of the watersheds, whereas those beside rivers were downstream. Analysis of the long-term evolution of landslides in the LRW showed that the geological setting, sinuousness of reaches, and sediment yield volume determined their location and evolution. Small-scale landslides constituted 71.9-96.2% of the total cases from 2003 to 2014, and were more easily induced after Typhoon Morakot (2009). The frequency density of landslides after Morakot was greater by one order than before, with 61% to 68% of total landslides located in the downslope. Small-scale landslides not beside the rivers disappeared within four years, whereas those beside rivers or located in the source areas either developed into large-scale landslides or slowly disappeared. Large-scale landslides caused by Morakot were either combined from several historical small-scale landslides in the river source areas or located beside the sinuous or meandering reaches. The probabilities of landslide recurrence in the LRW during the next 5, 10, and 20 years were determined to be 7.26%, 9.16%, and 10.48%, respectively, and those beside the rivers were 10.47%, 13.33%, and 15.41%, respectively.","Feng Chia Univ, Dept Water Resources Engn & Conservat, 100 Wenhua Rd, Taichung 407, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,1,1.0,1.0,"Wu, CH (corresponding author), Feng Chia Univ, Dept Water Resources Engn & Conservat, 100 Wenhua Rd, Taichung 407, Taiwan.",Ministry of Science and Technology of the Republic of Taiwan [MOST 106-2625-M-035-002-],Financial supports from the Ministry of Science and Technology of the Republic of Taiwan under contract MOST 106-2625-M-035-002- is appreciated.,extreme rainfall; landslide characteristic; landslide frequency density; landslide recurrence probability; sinuous rivers,10.3390/ijgi6110367,Article,TYPHOON MORAKOT; SEDIMENT; RIVER; PRECIPITATION; WASHINGTON; FREQUENCY; SEATTLE; FAILURE; JAPAN,MDPI,ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION,9,6,ISI,FENG CHIA UNIV,FENG CHIA UNIV,B2
2017.0,ISPRS Int. Geo-Inf.,Historic Low Wall Detection via Topographic Parameter Images Derived from FineResolution DEM,Chu H;Huang M;Tain Y;Yang M;Hofle B,"Coral walls protect vegetation gardens from strong winds that sweep across Xiji Island, Taiwan Strait for half the year. Topographic parameters based on light detection and ranging (LiDAR)-based high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) provide obvious correspondence with the expected form of landscape features. The information on slope, curvature, and openness can help identify the location of landscape features. This study applied the automatic landscape line detection to extract historic vegetable garden wall lines from a LiDAR-derived DEM. The three rapid processes used in this study included the derivation of topographic parameters, line extraction, and aggregation. The rules were extracted from a decision tree to check the line detection from multiple topographic parameters. Results show that wall line detection with multiple topographic parameter images is an alternative means of obtaining essential historic wall feature information. Multiple topographic parameters are highly related to low wall feature identification. Furthermore, the accuracy of wall feature detection is 74% compared with manual interpretation. Thus, this study provides rapid wall detection systems with multiple topographic parameters for further historic landscape management.","Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Geomat, Tainan 701, Taiwan.;  Heidelberg Univ, Inst Geog, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany.;",TAIWAN;GERMANY,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,5,1.0,,"Chu, HJ (corresponding author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Geomat, Tainan 701, Taiwan.","Headquarters of the University Advancement at the National Cheng Kung University - Ministry of Education, Taiwan","Thanks for enhancing the quality of the paper from the editors and anonymous reviewers.

Geo-Inf.,Efficient Method for POIROI Discovery Using Flickr Geotagged Photos,Kuo C;Chan T;Fan I;Zipf A,"In the era of big data, ubiquitous Flickr geotagged photos have opened a considerable opportunity for discovering valuable geographic information. Point of interest (POI) and region of interest (ROI) are significant reference data that are widely used in geospatial applications. This study aims to develop an efficient method for POI/ROI discovery from Flickr. Attractive footprints in photos with a local maximum that is beneficial for distinguishing clusters are first exploited. Pattern discovery is combined with a novel algorithm, the spatial overlap (SO) algorithm, and the naming and merging method is conducted for attractive footprint clustering. POI and ROI, which are derived from the peak value and range of clusters, indicate the most popular location and range for appreciating attractions. The discovered ROIs have a particular spatial overlap available which means the satisfied region of ROIs can be shared for appreciating attractions. The developed method is demonstrated in two study areas in Taiwan: Tainan and Taipei, which are the oldest and densest cities, respectively. Results show that the discovered POI/ROIs nearly match the official data in Tainan, whereas more commercial POI/ROIs are discovered in Taipei by the algorithm than official data. Meanwhile, our method can address the clustering issue in a dense area.","Acad Sinica, Res Ctr Humanities & Social Sci, Taipei 115, Taiwan.;  Acad Sinica, Inst Hist & Philol, Taipei 115, Taiwan.;  Heidelberg Univ, Inst Geog, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;GERMANY,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,4,1.0,,"Kuo, CL (corresponding author), Acad Sinica, Res Ctr Humanities & Social Sci, Taipei 115, Taiwan.","Postdoctoral Research Abroad Program (PRAP) - Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan (R.O.C.)

Many previous studies have examined factors including time, space, and type of crime, but the geographic characteristics of the grid are rarely discussed, leaving prediction models unable to predict crime displacement. This study incorporates the concept of a criminal environment in grid-based crime prediction modeling, and establishes a range of spatial-temporal features based on 84 types of geographic information by applying the Google Places API to theft data for Taoyuan City, Taiwan. The best model was found to be Deep Neural Networks, which outperforms the popular Random Decision Forest, Support Vector Machine, and K-Near Neighbor algorithms. After tuning, compared to our design's baseline 11-month moving average, the F1 score improves about 7% on 100-by-100 grids. Experiments demonstrate the importance of the geographic feature design for improving performance and explanatory ability. In addition, testing for crime displacement also shows that our model design outperforms the baseline.","Yuan Ze Univ, Dept Informat Management, 135 Yuan Tung Rd, Taoyuan 32003, Taiwan.;  Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Accounting, 1 Daxue Rd, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.;  Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Inst Finance, 1 Daxue Rd, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.;  Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Ctr Innovat FinTech Business Models, 1 Daxue Rd, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,,"Yu, LC (corresponding author), Yuan Ze Univ, Dept Informat Management, 135 Yuan Tung Rd, Taoyuan 32003, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and Technology, R.O.C.

2018.0,ISPRS Int. Geo-Inf.,Influences of the Shadow Inventory on a Landslide Susceptibility Model,Liu C;Luo W;Chung H;Yin H;Yan K,"A landslide inventory serves as the basis for assessing landslide susceptibility, hazard, and risk. It is generally prepared from optical imagery acquired from spaceborne or airborne platforms, in which shadows are inevitably found in mountainous areas. The influences of shadow inventory on a landslide susceptibility model (LSM), however, have not been investigated systematically. This paper employs both the shadow and landslide inventories prepared from eleven Formosat-2 annual images from the I-Lan area in Taiwan acquired from 2005 to 2016, using a semiautomatic expert system. A standard LSM based on the geometric mean of multivariables was used to evaluate the possible errors incurred by neglecting the shadow inventory. The results show that the LSM performance was significantly improved by 49.21% for the top 1% of the most highly susceptible area and that the performance decreased gradually by 15.25% for the top 10% most highly susceptible areas and 9.71% for the top 20% most highly susceptible areas. Excluding the shadow inventory from the calculation of landslide susceptibility index reveals the real contribution of each factor. They are crucial in optimizing the coefficients of a nondeterministic geometric mean LSM, as well as in deriving the threshold of a landslide hazard early warning system.","Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Global Earth Observat & Data Anal Ctr, Tainan 701, Taiwan.;  Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Tainan 701, Taiwan.;  Northern Illinois Univ, Dept Geog, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA.;  Council Agr, Soil & Water Conservat Bur, Debris Flow Disaster Prevent Ctr, Nantou 540, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;USA;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,5,1.0,1.0,"Liu, CC (corresponding author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Global Earth Observat & Data Anal Ctr, Tainan 701, Taiwan.; Liu, CC (corresponding author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Tainan 701, Taiwan.","Soil and Water Conservation Bureau, Council of Agriculture, Taiwan ROC [106AS-7.3.1-SB-S2]; Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan ROC [MoST 107-2611-M-006-002]","This research was funded by Soil and Water Conservation Bureau, Council of Agriculture, Taiwan ROC, under Contract Nos. 106AS-7.3.1-SB-S2, as well as the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan ROC, under Contract Nos.

2019.0,ISPRS Int. Geo-Inf.,Exploring Influence of Sampling Strategies on EventBased Landslide Susceptibility Modeling,Lai J;Chiang S;Tsai F,"This study explores two modeling issues that may cause uncertainty in landslide susceptibility assessments when different sampling strategies are employed. The first issue is that extracted attributes within a landslide inventory polygon can vary if the sample is obtained from different locations with diverse topographic conditions. The second issue is the mixing problem of landslide inventory that the detection of landslide areas from remotely-sensed data generally includes source and run-out features unless the run-out portion can be removed manually with auxiliary data. To this end, different statistical sampling strategies and the run-out influence on random forests (RF)-based landslide susceptibility modeling are explored for Typhoon Morakot in 2009 in southern Taiwan. To address the construction of models with an extremely high false alarm error or missing error, this study integrated cost-sensitive analysis with RF to adjust the decision boundary to achieve improvements. Experimental results indicate that, compared with a logistic regression model, RF with the hybrid sample strategy generally performs better, achieving over 80% and 0.7 for the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient, respectively, and higher accuracies can be obtained when the run-out is treated as an independent class or combined with a non-landslide class. Cost-sensitive analysis significantly improved the prediction accuracy from 5% to 10%. Therefore, run-out should be separated from the landslide source and labeled as an individual class when preparing a landslide inventory.","Feng Chia Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Taichung 40724, Taiwan.;  Natl Cent Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Taoyuan 32001, Taiwan.;  Natl Cent Univ, Ctr Space & Remote Sensing Res, Taoyuan 32001, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,1.0,"Tsai, F (corresponding author), Natl Cent Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Taoyuan 32001, Taiwan.; Tsai, F (corresponding author), Natl Cent Univ, Ctr Space & Remote Sensing Res, Taoyuan 32001, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and Technology of TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [108-2119-M-035-003]","This study was supported, in part, by the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan under the project 108-2119-M-035-003.",cost-sensitive analysis; landslide susceptibility; random forests; sampling strategy; Typhoon Morakot,10.3390/ijgi8090397,Article,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; LAND-COVER CLASSIFICATION; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; RANDOM FOREST; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; CONDITIONAL-PROBABILITY; SPATIAL PREDICTION; TYPHOON MORAKOT; SOUTHERN TAIWAN; SHALLOW,MDPI,ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION,5,8,ISI,FENG CHIA UNIV;NATL CENT UNIV;NATL CENT UNIV,NATL CENT UNIV;NATL CENT UNIV,B1

It is not only time-consuming and labor-intensive, but it is also difficult to maintain the principles of fairness and consistency. Due to specific political interests, objectivity is usually distorted and controversial in a proxy-election. In order to reflect the spirit of democracy, this study uses computing technologies to automatically divide the constituency and use the concepts of ""intelligent clustering"" and ""extreme arrangement"" to conquer many shortcomings of traditional artificial division. In addition, various informational technologies are integrated to obtain the most feasible solutions within the maximum capabilities of the computing system, yet without sacrificing the global representation of the solutions. We take Changhua County, Taiwan as an example of complete electoral districting, and find better results relative to the official version, which obtained a smaller difference in the population of each constituency, more complete and symmetrical constituencies, and fewer regional controversies. Our results demonstrate that multidimensional algorithms using a geographic information system could solve many problems of block districting to make decisions based on different needs.","Huafan Univ, Dept Mechatron Engn, New Taipei 22301, Taiwan.;  Mingchuan Univ, Dept Biotechnol, Taoyuan 33348, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,,"Chen, LY (corresponding author), Mingchuan Univ, Dept Biotechnol, Taoyuan 33348, Taiwan.",,,gerrymandering; plurality voting system; majority rule; NP-hard; cluster analysis; symmetry computing,10.3390/ijgi8090369,Article,,MDPI,ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION,0,8,ISI,HUAFAN UNIV;MINGCHUAN UNIV,MINGCHUAN UNIV,A

Geo-Inf.,Comparison of Ensemble Machine Learning Methods for Soil Erosion Pin Measurements,Nguyen K;Chen W;Lin B;Seeboonruang U,"Although machine learning has been extensively used in various fields, it has only recently been applied to soil erosion pin modeling. To improve upon previous methods of quantifying soil erosion based on erosion pin measurements, this study explored the possible application of ensemble machine learning algorithms to the Shihmen Reservoir watershed in northern Taiwan. Three categories of ensemble methods were considered in this study: (a) Bagging, (b) boosting, and (c) stacking. The bagging method in this study refers to bagged multivariate adaptive regression splines (bagged MARS) and random forest (RF), and the boosting method includes Cubist and gradient boosting machine (GBM). Finally, the stacking method is an ensemble method that uses a meta-model to combine the predictions of base models. This study used RF and GBM as the meta-models, decision tree, linear regression, artificial neural network, and support vector machine as the base models. The dataset used in this study was sampled using stratified random sampling to achieve a 70/30 split for the training and test data, and the process was repeated three times. The performance of six ensemble methods in three categories was analyzed based on the average of three attempts. It was found that GBM performed the best among the ensemble models with the lowest root-mean-square error (RMSE = 1.72 mm/year), the highest Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE = 0.54), and the highest index of agreement (d = 0.81). This result was confirmed by the spatial comparison of the absolute differences (errors) between model predictions and observations using GBM and RF in the study area. In summary, the results show that as a group, the bagging method and the boosting method performed equally well, and the stacking method was third for the erosion pin dataset considered in this study.","Natl Taipei Univ Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Taipei 10608, Taiwan.;  Sinotech Engn Consultants, Disaster Prevent Technol Res Ctr, Taipei 11494, Taiwan.;  King Mongkuts Inst Technol Ladkrabang, Fac Engn, Bangkok 10520, Thailand.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;THAILAND,TAIWAN,THAILAND,4,1.0,,"Chen, W (corresponding author), Natl Taipei Univ Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Taipei 10608, Taiwan.; Seeboonruang, U (corresponding author), King Mongkuts Inst Technol Ladkrabang, Fac Engn, Bangkok 10520, Thailand.","National Taipei University of Technology-King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang Joint Research Program [NTUT-KMITL-106-01, NTUT-KMITL-107-02, NTUT-KMITL-108-01]; Ministry of Science and Technology (Taiwan) Research Project [MOST 109-2121-M-027-001]","This study was partially supported by the National Taipei University of Technology-King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang Joint Research Program (Grant Numbers NTUT-KMITL-106-01, NTUT-KMITL-107-02, and NTUT-KMITL-108-01) and the Ministry of Science and Technology (Taiwan) Research Project (Grant Number MOST 109-2121-M-027-001).",soil erosion; erosion pin; ensemble machine learning; Shihmen Reservoir watershed; bagging; boosting; stacking,10.3390/ijgi10010042,Article,,MDPI,ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION,5,10,ISI,NATL TAIPEI UNIV TECHNOL;DISASTER PREVENT TECHNOL RES CTR;KING MONGKUTS INST TECHNOL LADKRABANG,NATL TAIPEI UNIV TECHNOL;KING MONGKUTS INST TECHNOL LADKRABANG,A

Extreme weather events accelerate the natural erosion process by triggering more landslides in watersheds. To achieve the land degradation neutrality set up by the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, it is necessary to assess and map spatiotemporal landslides in watersheds. This paper proposes an innovative approach to calculating the instability index by preparing an annual landslide inventory, determining the optimum sub-watershed, compensating for shadow effects on the time series of the landslide area ratio, and classifying the standard deviations to different levels of instability. Taking the Qingquan watershed as an example, the instability index calculated for 22 sub-watersheds makes it possible to identify hot spots that are prone to collapse. This new index can also be used to evaluate the effectiveness of watershed management before and after completion of a specific engineering project, as well as to update the latest upriver situation to evaluate current management practices and develop strategies for future planning. Based on this new approach, the Soil and Water Conservation Bureau of Taiwan assesses the stability of 28 watersheds, and the results are made available on the Big Geospatial Information System.","Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Global Earth Observat & Data Anal Ctr, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.;  Soil & Water Conservat Bur, Watershed Conservat & Management Div, Nantou 54044, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,5,1.0,1.0,"Liu, CC (corresponding author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Global Earth Observat & Data Anal Ctr, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.","Soil and Water Conservation Bureau, Council of Agriculture, Taiwan ROC [SWCB-106-113, SWCB-107-124]; Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan ROC; MOST [107-2611-M-006-002]","This research was funded by the Soil and Water Conservation Bureau, Council of Agriculture, Taiwan ROC, under Contract Nos.

Moreover, the influence of land disturbance was evaluated. The genetic adaptive neural network was used in combination with the texture analysis of the geographic information system for satellite image classification and interpretation to analyze land-use change and retrieve disaster records and surface information after five rainfall events from Typhoon Morakot (2009) to Typhoon Nanmadol (2011). The results revealed that except for extreme Morakot rains, the greater the degree of slope disturbance after rain, the larger the exposed slope. Extreme rainfall similar to Morakot strikes may have a greater impact on the bare land area than on slope disturbance. Moreover, the relationship between the bare land area and the index of land disturbance condition (I-LDC) is positive, and the ratio of the bare land area to the quantity of bare land after each rainfall increases with the I-LDC. With higher effective accumulative rainfall on the slope in the study area or greater slope disturbance, the landslide area at the second landslide point tended to increase.","Chang Jung Christian Univ, Dept Land Management & Dev, Tainan 71101, Taiwan.;  Chang Jung Christian Univ, Dept Business Adm, Tainan 71101, Taiwan.;  Magong Airport Off, Civil Aeronaut Adm, MOTC, Huxi 88593, Penghu, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,5,1.0,1.0,"Tseng, CM (corresponding author), Chang Jung Christian Univ, Dept Land Management & Dev, Tainan 71101, Taiwan.","Taiwan Ministry of Science and Technology [MOST 104-2625-M-309-002, MOST 109-2625-M-309-001]","This work was supported in part by grants from the Taiwan Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST 104-2625-M-309-002 and MOST 109-2625-M-309-001).

This study conducted two experiments. Experiment 1 involved 14 participants using the present Taipei Main Station floor map to wayfinding, plan routes, and provide route descriptions for four specified destinations in the station. All participants were requested to recall the route that had just been taken and draw a cognitive map. In Experiment 2, 14 other participants were asked to perform the same tasks as Experiment 1 but with the new map. This study's results showed that the codes used by the participants in Experiment 1 revealed the differences in walking route distance and number of turns. Escalators and stairs that connected floors were often used as reference landmarks for wayfinding. In Experiment 2, the overall wayfinding performance of the participants was improved by using the new map. The wayfinding time was reduced and the time spent in wayfinding among users was more uniform, and their route planning strategies used became consistent. The new map that facilitates consistent action strategies among users and corresponds perfectly to the actual environment is able to create useful spatial knowledge for users.","Natl Taipei Univ Technol, Dept Ind Design, 1,Sec 3,Chung Hsiao E Rd, Taipei 10608, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,,"Zheng, MC (corresponding author), Natl Taipei Univ Technol, Dept Ind Design, 1,Sec 3,Chung Hsiao E Rd, Taipei 10608, Taiwan.",,,landmarks; wayfinding map; route description; Taipei station,10.3390/ijgi10040266,Article,NAVIGATION; STRATEGIES,MDPI,ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION,0,10,ISI,NATL TAIPEI UNIV TECHNOL,NATL TAIPEI UNIV TECHNOL,A
2021.0,ISPRS Int. J. Geo-Inf.,Determining Cover Management Factor with Remote Sensing and Spatial Analysis for Improving LongTerm Soil Loss Estimation in Watersheds,Tsai F;Lai J;Nguyen K;Chen W,"The universal soil loss equation (USLE) is a widely used empirical model for estimating soil loss. Among the USLE model factors, the cover management factor (C-factor) is a critical factor that substantially impacts the estimation result. Assigning C-factor values according to a land-use/land-cover (LULC) map from field surveys is a typical traditional approach. However, this approach may have limitations caused by the difficulty and cost in conducting field surveys and updating the LULC map regularly, thus significantly affecting the feasibility of multi-temporal analysis of soil erosion. To address this issue, this study uses data mining to build a random forest (RF) model between eight geospatial factors and the C-factor for the Shihmen Reservoir watershed in northern Taiwan for multi-temporal estimation of soil loss. The eight geospatial factors were collected or derived from remotely sensed images taken in 2004, a digital elevation model, and related digital maps. Due to the memory size limitation of the R software, only 4% of the total data points (population dataset) in each C-factor class were selected as the sample dataset (input dataset) for analysis using the stratified random sampling method. Seventy percent of the input dataset was used to train the RF model, and the other 30% was used to test the model. The results show that the RF model could capture the trend of vegetation recovery and soil loss reduction after the destructive event of Typhoon Aere in 2004 for multi-temporal analysis. Although the RF model was biased by the majority class's large sample size (C = 0.01 class), the estimated soil erosion rate was close to the measurement obtained by the erosion pins installed in the watershed (90.6 t/ha-year). After the model's completion, we furthered our aim to address the input dataset's imbalanced data problem to improve the model's classification performance. An ad-hoc down-sampling of the majority class technique was used to reduce the majority class's sampling rate to 2%, 1%, and 0.5% while keeping the other minority classes at a 4% sample rate. The results show an improvement of the Kappa coefficient from 0.574 to 0.732, the AUC from 0.780 to 0.891, and the true positive rate of all minority classes combined from 0.43 to 0.70. However, the overall accuracy decreases from 0.952 to 0.846, and the true positive rate of the majority class declines from 0.99 to 0.94. The best average C-factor was achieved when the sampling rate of the majority class was 1%. On the other hand, the best soil erosion estimate was obtained when the sampling rate was 2%.","Natl Cent Univ, Ctr Space & Remote Sensing Res, Taoyuan 320, Taiwan.;  Natl Cent Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Taoyuan 320, Taiwan.;  Feng Chia Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Taichung 40724, Taiwan.;  Natl Taipei Univ Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Taipei 10608, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,4,1.0,,"Chen, WL (corresponding author), Natl Taipei Univ Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Taipei 10608, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan (ROC); NSCMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [100-2628-E-008-014-MY3, MOST 108-2221-E-008-001-MY3, MOST 109-2121-M-027-001]","This study was supported, in part, by the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan (ROC) under project No. NSC 100-2628-E-008-014-MY3, MOST 108-2221-E-008-001-MY3, and MOST 109-2121-M-027-001.",universal soil loss equation; USLE; NDVI; SAVI; multi-temporal remote sensing; spatial data mining; C-factor; random forest,10.3390/ijgi10010019,Article,EROSION; USLE; GIS,MDPI,ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION,2,10,ISI,NATL CENT UNIV;NATL CENT UNIV;FENG CHIA UNIV;NATL TAIPEI UNIV TECHNOL,NATL TAIPEI UNIV TECHNOL,A

Geo-Inf.,Effect of Compositions of MRT System Route Maps on Cognitive Mapping,Zheng M;Liu Y,"Route maps, common in public transportation systems, refer to thematic maps drawn according to topological concepts. To simplify complex route information, a transport network is represented using primary graphic elements. First used in 1931 with topological concepts, the octilinear design has influenced the compositions of traffic route maps to this day. The current study involved cognitive mapping research on a representative route map in Taiwan: the Metro Taipei Route Map. Through two task experiments, this study analyzed users' cognitive behavior when using the route map and alternative route map representations. The results indicated that the route map composed of all curves resulted in higher user performance than maps using a hybrid system and the conventional octilinear system. The route map based on the hybrid system, which included a route in the shape of a perfect circle, was highly evaluated and subjectively preferred by the users. Thus, the addition of appropriate curves in route maps is beneficial for improving usability, cognitive memory, and subjective evaluation. Finally, adding travel time information to a route map effectively enhances users' decision-making during route planning.","Natl Taipei Univ Technol, Dept Ind Design, 1 Sec 3,Chung Hsiao E Rd, Taipei 10608, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,,"Zheng, MC (corresponding author), Natl Taipei Univ Technol, Dept Ind Design, 1 Sec 3,Chung Hsiao E Rd, Taipei 10608, Taiwan.",,,transit map; topological map; cognitive mapping; Taipei metro,10.3390/ijgi10080569,Article,PATH CHOICE; USABILITY; DESIGN; MIND,MDPI,ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION,1,10,ISI,NATL TAIPEI UNIV TECHNOL,NATL TAIPEI UNIV TECHNOL,A

Geo-Inf.,Exploring the Planning and Configuration of the Hospital Wayfinding System by Space Syntax A Case Study of Cheng Ching Hospital Chung Kang Branch in Taiwan,Chen M;Ko Y;Hsieh W,"With regard to the outpatient areas of a hospital, the smoothness of the route is now taken into consideration in the process of configuring the wayfinding system. As patients often spend time on ineffective wayfinding processes, and there is limited manpower at hospitals and a lack of clarity in the information provided by the wayfinding system, it is difficult to provide effective and timely consultation services for patients. This study was conducted at Cheng Ching Hospital, Chung Kang Branch (CCH/CKB) in Taiwan. This study attempts to investigate the relationships between the wayfinding system of the outpatient areas and the patients' behaviors in the hospital. Depthmap software based on space syntax is adopted to assist in the route analysis and wayfinding behaviors. It integrates axial mapping analysis and isovist analysis and gives suggestions on the location, format and content of the wayfinding system. The final results of the study show that in the wayfinding task experiment gender has no significant impact on the effect of wayfinding efficiency, while a significant difference is found for age. Older people need more time to complete the wayfinding task, which means that they have poorer performance in wayfinding efficiency. The analysis of the results of space syntax shows that a good wayfinding system should be a symmetric tree-branch structure rather than circular structure in a medical building, that areas where it is easy to become lost should have a clear signage guiding system planning and configuration, and that clear guidance information should be provided to the patients to achieve the goal of saving consultation time and improving the quality of the medical environment.","Tunghai Univ, Dept Ind Design, 1727,Sec 4,Taiwan Blvd, Taichung 40704, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,,"Ko, YT (corresponding author), Tunghai Univ, Dept Ind Design, 1727,Sec 4,Taiwan Blvd, Taichung 40704, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and Technology of TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 105-2410-H-029-035]",This research was funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan under grant MOST 105-2410-H-029-035.,health care facilities; outpatient areas; wayfinding system; space syntax; wayfinding behaviors,10.3390/ijgi10080570,Article,VISUAL IMPAIRMENT; DESIGN,MDPI,ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION,0,10,ISI,TUNGHAI UNIV,TUNGHAI UNIV,A
2021.0,ISPRS Int. J. Geo-Inf.,Identification of shrinking cities on the main island of taiwan based on census data and population registers A spatial analysis,Hu D,"At the end of the 20th century, the phenomenon of urban shrinkage received widespread attention, with population decline as its core characteristic. In 2020, the Taiwanese population had negative growth and faced a low fertility rate and an aging population. This study used exploratory spatial data analysis to identify shrinking cities in Taiwan based on census data and population registers. The results indicated that Taiwan has 11 shrinking counties and 202 shrinking towns. Urban shrinkage occurred in the 1980s and continued from the suburbanization stage to the re-urbanization stage. Five types of spatial patterns in the 11 shrinking counties were observed. In the majority of the shrinking counties, towns with high population densities were unable to avoid shrinkage. A global spatial autocorrelation analysis indicated that shrinkage and non-shrinkage have become increasingly apparent at the town level since 2005. A local spatial autocorrelation analysis indicates that the spatial clustering of towns with population growth or decline from 2000 to 2020 has changed. Based on each town’s development, a two-step cluster analysis was conducted in which all towns were divided into four categories. Shrinking towns exist in each category, but with a different proportion. Based on the results of two-step cluster analysis combined with spatial analysis, this study discovered that both urbanization and suburbanization cause shrinkage in Taiwan, but the affected localities are distinct. For most shrinking counties, their spatial model indicates a relationship between shrinking and the urbanization of their towns. Keelung City and Chiayi City have the most potential to reverse the shrinkage. This study helps authorities better manage growth and implement regional revitalization. © 2021 by the author.

The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method was used to perform a weighted analysis that comprehensively identified important hindering factors based on information from hotel industry, government, academic, and consumer representatives. Overall, in order of importance, the five dimensions of hindering factors identified by these experts and scholars were hotel internal environment, consumers' environmental protection awareness, environmental protection incentive policy, hotel laws and regulations policy, and hotel external environment. Among the 26 examined hindering factor indices, the three highest-weighted indices overall for hoteliers applying for green hotel certification were as follows: environmental protection is not the main consideration of consumers seeking accommodations, lack of support by investment owners (shareholders), and lack of relevant subsidy incentives. The major contribution of this study is that hoteliers can understand important hindering factors associated with applying for green hotel certification; therefore, strategies that can encourage or enhance the green certification of hotels can be proposed to improve corporate image in the hotel industry, implement social responsibility in this industry, and obtain consumers' approval of and accommodation-willingness for green hotels.","Chinese Culture Univ, Dept Appl Sci Living, Taipei 11114, Taiwan.;  Fu Jen Catholic Univ, Dept Restaurant Hotel & Inst Management, New Taipei 242062, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,4,1.0,,"Lee, CS (corresponding author), Fu Jen Catholic Univ, Dept Restaurant Hotel & Inst Management, New Taipei 242062, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and Technology, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [109-2410-H-030-047]","This research was funded by Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan: 109-2410-H-030-047-.",green hotel; corporate social responsibility; green hotel certification,10.3390/ijgi10040255,Article,,MDPI,ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION,2,10,ISI,CHINESE CULTURE UNIV;FU JEN CATHOLIC UNIV,FU JEN CATHOLIC UNIV,A
1997.0,J Syst Integr,Cognitive management system based support for bank credit granting decision An integrated and practical design for Taiwan,Kuo H,"Taiwan has in recent years vigorously taken part in the international trend toward deregulation, and credit granting management for banks is currently getting a great deal of attention under deregulation. However, bank credit granting process is traditionally determined almost exclusively on the basis of the borrower's ability to put up collateral in Taiwan, To improve these problems, an integrated and objective bank credit granting system is needed. It might be valuable to make the bank much more vitally important to the economic development. This paper provides a cognitive framework regarding the setting up of a credit granting DSS for banks in Taiwan from an integrated and practical point of view Thus the development of a modified DSS architecture to manage bank credit granting effectively is main contribution in this paper. To propose an adaptive approach abandons the previous practice of depending almost purely upon collateral and suggest some necessary modified steps. And, the proposed system will significantly strengthen the competitive position of domestic banks against their foreign counterparts. This article employs cognitive concept and multi-stage decision model to develop a bank credit granting DSS for Taiwan. The proposed system is designed specifically to meet the problems currently confronting Taiwan, and is also used easily by personal computer. Hopefully, it will benefit us to redesign the credit granting model through an objective DSS. Furthermore, this paper describes an example of credit granting decision to verify the functions of the current system.","Inst. of Intl.

Earth Syst.,Multilocalization data assimilation for predicting heavy precipitation associated with a multiscale weather system,Yang S;Chen S;Kondo K;Miyoshi T;Liou Y;Teng Y;Chang H,"High-resolution numerical simulations are regularly used for severe weather forecasts. To improve model initial conditions, a single short localization is commonly applied in the ensemble Kalman filter when assimilating observations. This approach prevents large-scale corrections from appearing in a high-resolution analysis. To improve heavy rainfall forecasts associated with a multiscale weather system, analyses must be accurate across a range of spatial scales, a task that is difficult to accomplish using a single localization. This study is the first to apply a dual-localization (DL) method to improve high-resolution analyses used to forecast a real-case heavy rainfall event associated with a Meiyu front on 16 June 2008 in Taiwan. A Meiyu front is a multiscale weather system characterized by storm-scale convection, a mesoscale front, and large-scale southwesterly monsoonal flow. The use of the DL method to produce the analyses was able to correct both the synoptic-scale moisture flux transported by southwesterly monsoonal flow and the mesoscale low-level convergence offshore of southwestern Taiwan. As a result, the forecasted amount, pattern, and temporal evolution of the heavy rainfall event were improved. © 2017.

TaiESM1 is developed on the basis of the Community Earth System Model version 1.2.2, with the inclusion of several new physical schemes and improvements in the atmosphere model. The new additions include an improved triggering function in the cumulus convection scheme, a revised distribution-based formula in the cloud fraction scheme, a new aerosol scheme, and a unique scheme for three-dimensional surface absorption of shortwave radiation that accounts for the influence of complex terrains. In contrast to the majority of model evaluation processes, which focus mainly on the climatological mean, this evaluation focuses on climate variability parameters, including the diurnal rainfall cycle, precipitation extremes, synoptic eddy activity, intraseasonal fluctuation, monsoon evolution, and interannual and multidecadal atmospheric and oceanic teleconnection patterns. A series of intercomparisons between the simulations of TaiESM1 and CMIP6 models and observations indicate that TaiESM1, a participating model in CMIP6, can realistically simulate the observed climate variability at various time scales and are among the leading CMIP6 models in terms of many key climate features. © 2021.

1997.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Evolution of Pliocene to Pleistocene sedimentary environments in an arccontinent collision zone evidence from the analyses of lithofacies and ichnofacies in the southwestern foothills of Taiwan,Hong E,"Lithofacies and ichnofacies analyses reveal an excellent example of gradually subsiding and rapid infilling and uplifting of the sedimentary basin in the southwestern foothills of Taiwan, along the strike of the active Plio-Pleistocene orogeny. Ten well-exposed sections, roughly evenly distributed along a southwestern transect, were studied to construct the three-dimensional distribution of lithofacies and ichnofacies. Basin evolution is discussed in terms of temporal and spatial facies variations. In early Pliocene time, the shallow marine facies of the northern part of the study area were deposited on the passive Eurasian continental shelf. The sedimentary basin was deeper in the south, with a lower slope and/or basin floor setting. The ongoing are-continent collision caused flexural bending of the crust, inducing gradual subsidence of the basin during Pliocene and early Pleistocene time. Around 0.98 Ma, the onset of more rapid orogenic movements accelerated the basin subsidence, as indicated by rapid deepening of the facies northward along the basin axis, as well as by the widespread development of mass gravity transportation deposits and channel cutting structures. However, the basin was soon infilled and uplifted as part of the orogen within 0.8 my. Basin subsidence is much greater than previously indicated.

1997.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Kaoping Shelf Morphology and tectonic significance,Yu H;Chiang C,"Thirty bathymetric profiles across the southwestern Taiwan margin reveal two distinct physiographic features: a shelf and a slope separated at Fangliao. The Kaoping Shelf northwest of Fangliao is the offshore extension of the Pingtung Valley, and the unnamed slope west of the Hengchun Peninsula is a part of the submerged southern Central Range. The Kaoping Shelf is a short, narrow and shallow shelf (100 km long, 20 km wide and 80 m deep). This shelf can be divided into two subshelves. The one to the north is terraced with an average width of 28 km and the other to the south is a very narrow (9 km) and shallow (40 m) platform. The average gradient (5 m/km) of the shelf is greater than that (2.5 m/km) of the average shelf worldwide. The width of the shelf, ranging from 7 to 40 km, increases progressively from southeast to northwest and is a factor of 2-4 narrower than that of others in the world. The gradient and width reflect the youthful stage of development of the Kaoping Shelf. The seaward progradation of the sediments from the coastal plain of the Pingtung Valley resulted in the prograding Kaoping Shelf, as suggested by cored sediment samples and seismic profiles. The morphology of the Kaoping Shelf depends mainly on the tectonic setting of the uplifted Taiwan orogen and the accompanying foreland-basin sedimentation. This young (less than 400,000 years) shelf is still growing and prograding southward in a parallel direction with the southward propagating arc-continent collision in the Taiwan region.

2000.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Evolution of the southern TaiwanSinzi Folded Zone and opening of the southern Okinawa trough,Kong F;Lawver L;Lee T,"Recent interpretation of seismic sections and free-air gravity anomalies in offshore northern Taiwan reveals that the southern Taiwan-Sinzi Folded Zone began to form in late Middle Miocene, though it was mainly constructed in the Late Pliocene with strong reverse faulting and folding. Two westward progradational sequences were deposited in the shelf basin with sediments supplied from the southern Taiwan-Sinzi Folded Zone and the southern Ryukyu Are. These two structures are displaced by several northwest-striking dextral strike-slip faults that were active in the early Quaternary when the clockwise-rotated southern Ryukyu Are and the folded southern Taiwan-Sinzi Folded Zone were broken. It is believed that recent extension in the southern Okinawa Trough started in the early Quaternary because uplift on the southern Taiwan-Sinzi Folded Zone continued to latest Pliocene-early Quaternary. Paleogene-Miocene sediments of the East China Sea Shelf in the western part of the southern Okinawa Trough Basin are interpreted to indicate that the East China Sea Shelf Basin extended to the east of the southern Taiwan-Sinzi Folded Zone.

2000.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Late Holocene 2 ka sea level river discharge and climate interrelationship in the Taiwan region,Liew P;Hsieh M,"Based on the palynological study of two alpine lakes of the central mountains and a lake at 460 m elevation in northeastern Taiwan, a warm event which lasted several hundred years from about cal 2 ka, followed a cool-dry interval from about cal 3.7-2.0 ka. Evidence indicates a warmer annual temperature of 1-2 degrees C and relatively higher precipitation during the warm interval compared with the cool-dry interval. Sea level at cal 2-1.5 ka is estimated to have been 130-150 cm higher than at present based on data from the Penghu Islands off western Taiwan (Chen and Liu, Quaternary Research 45, 254-262, 1996). In northern Taiwan, the corresponding sea level rise is recognized by a widening of the estuary in the Taipei Basin (Lin, Development of Taipei City, pp. 159-246, 1981), which is consistent with the distribution of archaeological sites around cal 2 ka. The age of lower river terraces in northern (Lanyang) and southern (Erhjen) Taiwan, are consistently in the range cal. 2.5-1.5 ka. This suggests an island-wide morphological process, probably relating to climate change. This study discusses the inferred climate change and possible morphological responses.

2000.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Melting experiment of a Wannienta basalt in the Kuanyinshan area northern Taiwan at pressures up to 20 GPa,Liu T;Chen B;Chen C,"Melting experiments involving fifteen runs were performed at pressures between 1.0 and 2.0 GPa in order to locate the liquidus temperatures, the solidus temperatures, and the melting intervals of the Wannienta basaltic magma, northern Taiwan. The experimental results showed that the liquidus and solidus temperatures were raised by 60 GPa and 40 GPa respectively. The liquidus mineral at 1.0 GPa is orthopyroxene, whereas the liquidus mineral is clinopyroxene at 1.5 and 2.0 GPa. The crystallized phases are clinopyroxene and plagioclase at temperatures between 1220 and 1270 degrees C and pressures between 1.0 and 2.0 GPa. Garnet appears at 2.0 GPa near the solidus. The geochemical evolution of the residual magma with decreasing temperature show the following trends: At 1.0 GPa, Al, Na, and K are progressively enriched while depletions occur in Mg. At 2.0 GPa, Si, Fe and K are progressively enriched with decreasing temperature while depletions occur in Mg, Ca, and Na. The fractionation trend of the Kuanyinshan volcanic series is similar to the trend observed in residual magmas at pressures between one atmosphere and 1.0 GPa. These results indicate that the depth for fractional crystallization of the Wannienta basaltic magma to produce andesites could be modeled at low pressure. The fractionates involved included iron-titanium oxides, olivine, plagioclase, and clinopyroxene. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

2000.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,The morphology of thrust faulting in the 21 September 1999 Chichi Taiwan earthquake,Bilham R;Yu T,"The 80-km-long surface rupture of the Chelungpu fault in the 21 September 1999, Chichi, Taiwan Mw=7.6 earthquake resulted in a surface scarp with vertical throws of 2-9 m, and horizontal heaves of 4-8 m. Few major thrust faults have broken the surface in the past century, and the Chelungpu surface rupture is of interest in that it provides a morphological template for the identification of paleo-surface thrusts in similar neotectonic environments such as the Himalaya. The toe of the thrust is found emplaced gently over underlying hanging-wall materials, partly by prograde hanging-wall rotation and partly by simple shear, leaving few overt clues as to the total amount or sense of slip. Despite the large surface slip near the toe of the Chelungpu thrust its emplacement appears to have been relatively slow. MSK (the Medvedev-Sponheuer-Karnik 1981 revision of the Seismic Intensity Scale MSK81 supersedes the Mercalli Intensity scale for the description of acceleration-induced damage to modern buildings) Intensity VIII accelerations were imposed on buildings on the hanging-wall, and Intensity VII on the footwall, decaying in both directions by perhaps one intensity unit a few hundred meters from the rupture. The somewhat moderate amplitude of these accelerations, for a rupture with several meters of slip, is attributed to non-linear dissipative deformation near the toe of the rupture. The partitioning of thrusting into basal slip and hillside steepening in some locations on the Chelungpu fault suggests that the estimation of paleoseismic slip from the offset of piercing points crossing historic thrust faults elsewhere may result in underestimates of fault slip.

2001.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Structural evolution from Paleogene extension to Latest MioceneRecent arccontinent collision offshore Taiwan comparison with on land geology,Huang C;Xia K;Yuan P;Chen P,"Marine structures observed in seismic profiles across the NE South China Sea-Taiwan Strait-Luzon Arc region show that they are comparable to those observed onshore Taiwan. The Hanjiang Depression and Dongsha Uplift off the SE China coast extend to the Penghu Basin and Penghu Platform, respectively, in the Taiwan Strait, while the Tainan Basin in the south of Penghu Platform is connected to the Chaoshan Depression south of the Dongsha Uplift. The Hanjiang Depression and the Penghu Basin are composed of Paleogene syn-rift sequences on the Mesozoic basement and are uncomformably overlain by Neogene post-rift strata. Similar successions are found underneath the coastal plain or have been thrust up as a fold-and-thrust belt bordering the Peikang Basement High onshore central Taiwan. East of the Manila Trench, off southwestern Taiwan, parts of the Tainan Basin are thrust into the submarine syn-collision accretionary wedge (the fold-and-thrust Kaoping Slope) in the initial arc-continent collision zone. They have also been exposed in the fold-and-thrust Western Foothills south of the Peikang Basement High in southern Taiwan during an advanced stage of arc-continent collision since the Late Pliocene. Further east, the pre-collision accretionary wedge (the Hengchun Ridge) shoals northward to the Hengchun Peninsula, with Late Miocene turbidites unconformably overlain by Plio-Pleistocene shallow-marine slope basin sequences. In the arc domain, cast of the arc-prism boundary fault, the western forearc sequences in the North Luzon Trough are deformed. Two normal-faulted intra-arc basins occur on the eastern part of the Lanhsu Island in the Luzon Arc. The scenario of the deformed forearc sequences and the development of the two intraarc basins in the initial arc-continent collision zone are analogous to the Lichi Melange-Taiyuan Basin and the intra-arc basins in the southern Coastal Range, eastern Taiwan. Additionally, the lateral change in the marine structure from the passive Asian continental margin to the Manila subduction system is comparable to the temporal evolution from Paleogene normal faulting, through Neogene subduction, to Latest Miocene-Recent are-continent collision observed onshore Taiwan.

2001.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Titanite inclusions in altered biotite from granitoids of Taiwan microstructures and origins,Yui T;Shen P;Lin H,"Biotites with three sets of titanite inclusions (i.e., sagenitic biotites) have been reported from both igneous and metamorphic rocks. Two formation mechanisms have been postulated: the 'precipitation' model for the sagenitic biotite of igneous origin (Shau, Y.H., Yang, H.Y., Peacor, D.R., 1991. On oriented titanite and rutile inclusions in sagenitic biotite. Am. Mineral 76, 1205-1217.) and the 'percussion figure' model for the sagenitic biotite of metamorphic origin (Xu, S., Ji, S., 1991. Biotite percussion figures in naturally deformed mylonites. Tectonophysics 190, 373-380.) Sagenitic biotites in granitoids of the Tananao Metamorphic Complex of Taiwan were studied, especially with regard to the variable degrees of superimposed collision-induced deformation/metamorphism. Mass balance considerations, transmission electron microscopic observations and regional geological relations exclude the simple intra-biotite precipitation model as the possible mechanism. Instead, the formation of titanite inclusions in these igneous biotites is suggested more likely to be facilitated by inward diffusion of Ca and outward diffusion of Ti along the basal cleavage planes and the fracture surfaces induced by shear deformation (i.e., the percussion figure) in biotites under greenschist-facies temperature conditions. Interdiffusion may also account for the formation of rutile particles with varied size and varied crystallographic orientation in some titanite laths. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

2001.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Vitrinite reflectance as a possible indicator of metamorphic grade and stratigraphic position of formations a study of Oligocene metapelites in NE Taiwan,Lin M;Lin C;You M,"A total of 47 samples of Oligocene metapelites collected from the northeastern (NE) Hsuehshan Range, Taiwan, were studied by measuring vitrinite reflectance. The vitrinite reflectance of the three studied stratigraphic units, from top to bottom, are as follows: the Tatungshan Formation: (R) over bar (max)(mean maximum vitrinite reflectance) = 1.35-2.76% and (R) over bar (m)(mean random vitrinite reflectance) = 1.18-2.56%; the Tsuku Formation: (R) over bar (max) = 2.89-3.51% and (R) over bar (m) = 2.37-3.26%; and the Kankou Formation: (R) over bar (max) = 4.06-5.97% and (R) over bar (m) = 3.04-5.07%. Either (R) over bar (max) or (R) over bar (m) changes continuously along the studied geologic sections, and the variation serves well as a metamorphic grade indicator. In the studied area, each stratigraphic formation has its own characteristic vitrinite reflectance value range. It is postulated that, in the future, vitrinite reflectance can also serve as an indicator of stratigraphic position of formations to aid stratigraphic identification and correlation in geologic mappings.

2002.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Identification of diagenetic artifacts in foraminiferal shells using carbon and oxygen isotopes,Shieh Y;You C;Shea K;Horng C,"We have analyzed carbon and oxygen isotopes of two groups of planktonic foraminiferal shells from sediments near the Pliocene/Pleistocene (P/P) and the Miocene/Pliocene (M/P) boundaries, in the Lower Gutingkeng Formation in southwestern Taiwan. The P/P shells display heavier isotopic compositions (delta(18)O = -1.5parts per thousand, delta(13)C = 1.5parts per thousand) over a narrow range, suggesting a pristine environmental signature. On the other hand, the M/P shells are much lighter (delta(18)O = -3 to -7parts per thousand, delta(13)C = 1 to -1.5parts per thousand), and more scattered, associated with secondary carbonate diagenesis. Our detailed SEM examination confirms this proposition. The P/P shells display a clean micro-texture and are free from carbonate recrystallization. However, there are abundant secondary calcite crystals in the M/P shells. Therefore, the extreme shift of delta(18)O and delta(13)C in foraminiferal shells provides a guideline for evaluation of diagenetic artifacts of deeply buried sediments that have been uplifted on land.

2002.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Lithofacies of volcanic rocks in the central Coastal Range eastern Taiwan implications for island arc evolution,Song S;Lo H,"The Miocene igneous rocks in the central Coastal Range, eastern Taiwan, consists of intrusive diabase, andesitic lavas, andesitic to dacitic volcaniclastic rocks, ignimbrites and basaltic lavas. Based on rock characteristics, they can be grouped into ten lithofacies. Furthermore, these lithofacies can be appropriately linked to form five lithofacies associations according to paleoenvironments and type of volcanism. The volcanic eruptions may have commenced on a deep ocean floor in the early Miocene, poured out in a shallowing environment in the middle to late Miocene and, finally, taken place in a subaerial condition at the end of the Miocene. Subaqueous eruptions produced voluminous pillow lavas and breccias, hyaloclastites, massive lavas and thick volcaniclastic deposits. Subaerial eruptions yielded only limited amounts of ignimbrites and basaltic lavas. After the cessation of volcanism due to the arc-continent collision, the volcanoes rapidly subsided and were later overlain by thick terrigenous sediments. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Asian Earth Sci.,Thrustrelated river terrace development in relation to the 1999 ChiChi earthquake rupture Western Foothills central Taiwan,Chen W;Chen Y;Shih R;Liu T;Huang N;Lin C;Sung S;Lee K,"The 21 September 1999 earthquake (M-W 7.6) produced a surface rupture that extended for 100-km in a general north-south direction in front of the Western Foothills, central Taiwan. The study area, located in a segment of the fold-thrust belt of central Taiwan, provides an important natural laboratory to study the relationship between active thrust deformation and fluvial terrace development. We recognize, from west to east, three subparallel thrusts, the Sanyi, Houli, and Shihkang faults in the northern part of the earthquake disaster area. The 1999 earthquake rupture occurred only along the Shihkang fault, whereas the other two faults were inactive. Along the Tachia River in the hanging wall of the Shihkang fault, eight well-developed terrace levels are observed, and can be subdivided into lateritic (Lt5-Ltl) and non-lateritic terraces (Ft3-Ft1). Five levels of lateritic terrace (Lt5-Lt1) are located in the hanging wall of the Houli fault, and a lateritic terrace (Lt5) is present in the hanging wall of the Sanyi fault. Stratigraphic and elevation correlations between these well-developed fluvial terraces in relationship to nearby geologic structures show that the Sanyi fault is the oldest structure. Lateritic terraces of at least 10,000 yr BP, for example, overlie the Sanyi fault, but correlative terraces associated with the Houli fault are offset. These types of terrace correlations allow us to define the progressive development of the thrust system within the Western Foothills.

2004.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Geomorphic evidence and kinematic model for quaternary transfer faulting of the Pakuashan anticline Central Taiwan,Sung Q;Chen Y,"The Pakuashan-Tatushan anticline and the related Changhua thrust are characterized by a regional curvature of the deformation front. which deviates from the general trend of the thrust system in the Western Foothills of Taiwan. A Quaternary transfer fault zone. which accommodates the motion of connected thrust sheets over an oblique feature of the preexisting margin basement. is proposed to explain this regional phenomenon. There are distinct morphological features in the Pakuashan ridge related to the transfer faulting. The stream valley orientations responding to the regional slope change and left-laterally offset valleys concur to support the existence of the tear faults. These observations lead us to propose a 2-D kinematic model in order to illustrate the geometry of the Pakuashan ridge adjusted by the tear faulting. Based on this kinematic model. we infer that the Changhua thrust system moves over an oblique ramp which bounds the Peikang Basement High. The oblique ramp is composed of three segments corresponding to the northern, central and southern Pakuashan. The gentle northern and southern ramps are connected by the steep central ramp. This ramp model can illustrate the kinematics of the Pakuashan transfer fault zone and has the potential to predict the local deformation (extension and compression) with respect to the geometry of the intersection of oblique ramps. The Pakuashan-Tatushan anticline and the related Changhua thrust system is one of typical examples of thrust sheet deformation associated with oblique ramps. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

2004.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Late Pleistocene to Holocene environmental changes as recorded in the sulfur geochemistry of coastal plain sediments southwestern Taiwan,Chen Y;Liu J;Shieh Y;Liu T,"A core, drilled at San-liao-wan in the southwestern coastal plain of Taiwan, has been analyzed for total sulfur contents, isotopic values, as well as ratios of pyritic sulfur to organic carbon. Our results demonstrate a close relationship between late Pleistocene sea-level change and the proxies generated in this study. The inorganic sulfur contents indicate that at our study site, the Holocene transgression started at similar to11 ka and remained under seawater for thousands of years until the late Holocene, corresponding to a depth of 20 m in the study core. The uppermost 20 m of core shows relatively high total organic carbon (TOC) and delta(34)S of inorganic sulfur, suggesting a transitional environment such as muddy lagoon or marsh, before the site turned into a modern coastal plain. In the lower part of the core, at depths of 110-145 m (corresponding ages of similar to12-30 ka), low sulfur contents are recorded, probably indicating fluvial sediments deposited during the oceanic isotope stage (OIS) 2, a sea-level lowstand. The lower part of the core, roughly within OIS 3, records at least two transgressions, although the transgressional signals may be somewhat obscured by subsequent weathering. The reworked origin of organic matter reported in previous studies is confirmed by our organic sulfur data; however, the marine organic source was periodically dominant. The modern high sulfate concentrations in pore water have no correlation to the other sulfur species in the sediments, probably indicating that the sulfate migrated into the site subsequent to early diagenesis.

2004.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Quantitative analysis of movement along an earthquake thrust scarp a case study of a vertical exposure of the 1999 surface rupture of the Chelungpu fault at Wufeng western Taiwan,Lee J;Rubin C;Mueller K;Chen Y;Chan Y;Sieh K;Chu H;Chen W,"A vertical exposure across the principal thrust scarp of the 1999 Mw 7.6 earthquake allows quantification of fault slip. The exposure is located on the active Chelungpu fault near Wufeng, along the range front of the fold-and-thrust belt in western Taiwan. The 1999 surface ruptures at the Wufeng site are characterized by a west-facing 2 to 3 m high principal thrust scarp and an east-facing lesser backthrust scarp. We mapped a 15 m-long, 5 m-deep exposure across the principal thrust scarp and characterized complex deformation structures, which include a main basal thrust fault, a wedge thrust, and a pop-up anticlinal fold with two secondary opposing thrust faults. The vertical displacement across the principal thrust scarp is measured directly from the offsets of the same sedimentary horizons between the hanging wall and the footwall. The average vertical displacement is 2.2 +/- 0.1 m, and the maximum displacement is 2.5 m, at the crest of the small pop-up fold. Horizontal displacement estimates were determined using line- and area-balancing methods. With line-length methods we estimated a horizontal displacement of 3.3 +/- 0.3 m across the principal scarp for four sedimentary horizons. For area balancing, first we selected three horizontal soil/sand deposits with a total thickness of about 0.5 m. The estimate yields an average horizontal displacement of 4.8 +/- 1.0 m. Using these individual and relatively thin stratigraphic layers yielded significant standard deviations in displacement estimates as a result of thickness variations. Second, we used the 3 m-thick overbank soil/sand and the lower part of fluvial pebble/cobble to calculate a horizontal displacement of 2.6 +/- 0.2 m with the area-balancing technique. According to the geometry of the dip angle (35-40degrees) of the basal thrust, the line-length measurement and the 3 m-thick package area balancing both provided reasonable results of horizontal displacement. By comparing the different deposits applied to the line- and area-balancing methods, we interpret that decoupling of deformation occur-red between the lower fluvial gravels and the upper overbank sand and mud deposits. Due to lesser confining pressure at the surface, additional deformation occurred in the upper 1-2 m thick overbank deposits. This additional deformation yielded further vertical uplift of 0.3-0.5 m and horizontal displacement of 0.2-0.8 m around the core of the pop-up fold. Our work suggests that determination of slip across surface thrust ruptures varies as a function of the mechanical behavior of young late Quaternary deposits. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

2006.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Shifting submarine canyons and development of a foreland basin in SW Taiwan controls of foreland sedimentation and longitudinal sediment transport,Yu H;Hong E,"The modem Penghu Submarine Canyon is a sea floor expression of the convergent boundary between the frontal Taiwan orogenic wedge and the Chinese cratonic margin. The canyon is about 180 km long and trends N-S, parallel to the strike of the Taiwan mountain belt. It is similar to 240 m deep at the head increasing to similar to 3200 m deep at its mouth before merging gradually into the Manila Trench. The Penghu Canyon is considered a tectonically controlled canyon rather than a slope canyon dominated by down-slope processes. Tectonic controls prevail over sedimentary processes. Tectonics controls the orientation and location of the Penghu Canyon while sedimentary processes contribute to its excavation and enlargement. The axis of the deep-water, underfilled basin off SW Taiwan dips southward and parallels the strike of the Taiwan orogen with a characteristic longitudinal sediment transport route. Hence, the Penghu Canyon developed under the gravitational mass movement with its main course along the N-S basin axis, not in a SW or SE downslope direction of both margins. The initial Penghu Canyon began at the intersection of the upper slopes of the South China Sea and Kaoping Slopes. Sediment flows cut into the slope sediments following regional dip toward the south, and excavated along the deepest part of the sea floor, forming the present Penghu Canyon. Shifting of axes of Late Pliocene-Pleistocene canyons from onshore SW Taiwan to the present-day position of the Penghu Canyon reflects the evolving foreland basins with a longitudinal canyon transport system progressively migrating southwestward. The linkage of canyon migration and evolution of the foreland basin may have significant implications for the overall sedimentation and tectonics of the SW Taiwan region. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

To explore the seismogenic mechanism and its causative fault system, we relocated the aftershocks, determined the focal mechanisms from P-wave polarities and used the Finite Dimension Source Model method to identify the fault plane. Based on our results, the earthquake can be divided into three seismic clusters: one is located in the east of the southern Longitudinal Valley, one on the Chilishang fault, and the other on the western side of the Luyeh fault to the south. Both the seismic distribution and Finite Dimension Source Model method show that east-dipping fault planes with thrust mechanisms coincide with previous studies based on background seismicity. The third seismic cluster suggests thrust mechanism along west-dipping fault plane that was not recognized by background seismicity. This seismic Cluster occurred along the Central Range Fault previously proposed as active by geomorphic and geologic evidence. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

2007.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Active deformation front delineated by drainage pattern analysis and vertical movement rates southwestern Coastal Plain of Taiwan,Yang C;Chen W;Wu L;Lin C,"Orogenesis in Taiwan results from an arc-continent collision between the Eurasian plate and the Philippine Sea plate. The southwestern part of Taiwan absorbs active shortening as evidenced by rapid crustal deformation and frequent earthquakes. Southwestern Taiwan may be subdivided into three tectonic-geomorphic domains, including the plain (PL), the tilted tableland (TT), and the low hills (LH), based on geomorphology, drainage pattern and stratigraphic records. The PL domain is the westernmost and is characterized by meandering rivers with relatively low surface slope and river gradient, but high river sinuosity. The TT domain has slightly tilted terraces with river meanders and many tributaries are developed on its surface. Anomalous river sinuosity occurs as a result of active tectonics. The LH domain has higher elevation and deformed geomorphic surfaces associated with a dissected landscape. This domain also has high stream gradients with low sinuosity which may indicate active deformation. We define crustal deformation, using Holocene deposits and radiocarbon dating in addition to geomorphic analysis that suggests a blind thrust may exist between the PL and TT domains. This blind thrust may indicate the position of the active deformation front of the orogenic belt of southwest Taiwan. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

2007.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Characterizing the Hsincheng active fault in northern Taiwan using airborne LiDAR data Detailed geomorphic features and their structural implications,Chan Y;Chen Y;Shih T;Huang C,"We applied newly acquired high-resolution airborne LiDAR data to study a segment of the Hsincheng fault, a well-known active fault near a large industrial park in northern Taiwan. The Hsincheng fault has received much attention and study in the past; but high spatial resolution digital elevation models have not previously been applied to the study of the fault and its surrounding structures. We processed the acquired LiDAR data and produced I in digital elevation models (DEMs) to investigate the active fault adjacent to the densely populated and important infrastructure in Taiwan. Using the LiDAR DEMs, aerial photographs and topographic maps, we show highly detailed geomorphic characteristics around the study area of the Hsincheng fault. Three major characteristics of the study area are defined that include three very well preserved river terraces at varying levels, the fault/fold scarp of the Hsincheng fault, and meandering river systems. Using the LiDAR DEMs, we were able to detect with precision several fault/fold scarps and very gentle NE-trending folding of the river terraces. In general, the LiDAR DEMs have provided unprecedented clarity of landforms for one segment of the Hsincheng fault, which has helped the characterization of subtle but important geomorphic features.

Asian Earth Sci.,Fault activity and lateral extrusion inferred from velocity field revealed by GPS measurements in the Pingtung area of southwestern Taiwan,Hu J;Hou C;Shen L;Chan Y;Chen R;Huang C;Rau R;Chen K;Lin C;Huang M;Nien P,"Four campaigns of dense GPS measurements have been conducted since 1995 to investigate crustal deformation patterns in SW Taiwan. The station velocities decrease westwards from 42.2 to 55.5 mm/yr along the azimuths from 247.1 degrees V to 272.5 degrees. In central part of the study area, GPS stations move nearly toward the west, whereas in the Pingtung-Kaohsiung coastal area, displacement vectors demonstrate a clear counter-clockwise deviation toward the SW. The transtensional deformation and the along-strike variation of southward increase of extensional deformation is due to the low lateral confining conditions related to the Manila subduction zone as a free boundary or/and the presence of the prominent Peikang High as a rigid indentor. The Chishan Fault is dominated by right-lateral motion with a fault slip rate similar to 7 mm/yr in a N50 degrees W direction. The Kaoping Fault is dominated by left-lateral motion with a similar to 4-8 mm/yr in a N-S direction. The significant right-lateral component of motion of similar to 24-30mm/yr is accommodated along the active structures west of the Chishan Fault. The right-lateral and left-lateral structures facilitate the southwestward extrusion. The velocity gradients of the GPS stations across the Chaochou Fault are not significant. This implies that the Chaochou Fault is locked along the fault plane. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

2007.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Lahars in and around the Taipei basin Implications for the activity of the Shanchiao fault,Song S;Chen T;Tsao S;Chen H;Liu H,"In the last decade, more than 21 deep geological cores have been drilled in the Taipei basin to obtain a firmer grasp of its basic geology and engineering properties prior to the construction of new infrastructure. Thirteen of those cores contain lahar deposits, with the number of layers varying from one to three and the thickness of each layer varying from several to over 100 m. Based on their occurrence, petrology and geochemistry, it has been determined that the deposits originated from the southern slope of the Tatun Volcano Group (TVG). K-Ar age dating has shown that the lower layer of lahars was deposited less than 0.4 Ma, and this is clearly correlated to outcrops in the Kauntu, Chengtzeliao and Shihtzutao areas. These findings may well suggest that the Taipei basin has been formed in last 0.4 Ma and that the Shanchiao normal fault commenced its activity within this period. The surface trace and the activity of the Shanchiao normal fault have also been inferred and subsequently defined from stratigraphic data derived from these cores. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The earthquake created a 95-km-long surface rupture and associated fault-related fold scarps. This study focused on the fault-related fold at two locations, where the fold scarp is characterized with trench excavation and shallow cored boring results. The structural characteristics revealed by the two trench sites are consistent with a trishear fault-propagation fold growth above a blind thrust. Several characteristics of the fold observed in the Holocene deposits show smoothly rounded fold-hinges, unconformities, onlapped structure, and downward steepening of forelimb strata. Results from these structures suggest that the fold grows by progressive limb rotation of growth strata in sequential coseismic growth episodes. The growth strata show several unconformable contacts as indicated by paleosoil horizons developed on event horizons. Based on the syntectonic sedimentary structure, three events are revealed at the Siangong-Temple site and two paleoearthquake events on the Shijia site. Integration with the two trenches and the previous studies suggests the three paleoearthquake events occurred 300-430, 710-800, and 1710-1900 yr B.P. These data on the two trench sites indicate that the average slip rate is 4.2 and 4.5 mm/yr, respectively. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Asian Earth Sci.,Reevaluation of the surface ruptures of the November 1951 earthquake series in eastern Taiwan and its neotectonic implications,Shyu J;Chung L;Chen Y;Lee J;Sieh K,"The earthquakes of November 1951 constitute the most destructive seismic episode in the recorded history of the Longitudinal Valley, eastern Taiwan. However, information about their source parameters is sparse. To understand the relationship between the 1951 ruptures and new interpretations of the regional neotectonic architecture of the Longitudinal Valley, we re-evaluated the November 1951 ruptures by analyzing old documents, reports and photographs, and by interviewing local residents who experienced the earthquake. As a result, we have revised significantly the rupture map previously published. We divide the surface ruptures from south to north into the Chih-shang, Yuli, and Rueisuei sections. The first shock of the 1951 series probably resulted from the Chihshang rupture, and the second shock probably resulted from the Yuli and Rueisuei ruptures. The lengths of these ruptures indicate that the two shocks had similar magnitudes. The Chihshang and Rueisuei ruptures are along segments of the Longitudinal Valley fault, a left-lateral oblique fault along which the Coastal Range thrusts westward over the Longitudinal Valley. The Yuli rupture, on the other hand, appears to be part of a separate, left-lateral strike-slip Yuli fault, which traverses the middle of the Longitudinal Valley. The complex behavior of these structures and interaction between them are important in understanding the future seismic hazard of the area. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

2007.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,River terrace development in response to folding above active wedge thrusts in Houli Central Taiwan,Chen Y;Hung J;Lai K;Lin Y;Wilcox T;Mueller K,"Folding at the leading edge of the western Taiwan thrust belt is well preserved by a flight of fluvial terraces at Houli. Strain in this region is driven by slip on the north trending Changhua and Sanyi blind wedge thrusts and occurs at the boundary between the Miaoli and Taichung neotectonic domains located respectively to the north and south. In the past century, two large historical earthquakes occurred in these two domains and produced surface ruptures within or close to the study area, indicating Houli is not only tectonically active but also critical for understanding the interaction between the neighboring active systems. Although abundant river terraces and their deformation by active structures have long been well known in the area, a kinematical model for this region has not yet been proposed. We have therefore remapped the geomorphic features using the 40m DEM and aerial photos to identify often subtle structural features in order to separate the effects of folding interference produced by different active structural systems. Besides the Tuntzuchiao fault (TTCF), which generated the 1935 earthquake, two other active regional scale structural systems have been reported in Houli area: the Tiechanshan (TCS) anticline and the Changhua fault (CHF). Our results demonstrate a number of tectonic scarps and warped surfaces in association with the CHF and its coupled back thrust, indicating that the CHF system is active. In contrast, the flight of fluvial terraces distributed in the middle of the study area cannot be related to the growth of the TCS anticline. Instead, terraces here record growth of another smaller and previously unknown anticline, Yuehmei (tentatively named in this study and shortened to YM in the text). Although it has developed parallel to the TCS anticline, relevant seismic profiles show the YM anticline as a local drag-fold attached to the southern limb of the TCS anticline and restricted in the Houli area. Based on the above observation, the TCS anticline can be interpreted as becoming less active where strain is instead transferred to the more rapidly uplifting YM anticline. This structural switch may be the result of interference between the newly developed southern Taichung system and the preexisting TCS anticline. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

2007.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Structure of the 1999 ChiChi earthquake rupture and interaction of thrust faults in the active fold belt of western Taiwan,Lee J;Chan Y,"We summarize the structural characteristics of the surface ruptures of the 1999 Mw 7.6 Chi-Chi earthquake in western Taiwan and discuss the geological interaction of the Chelungpu fault with adjacent faults. Based on geological investigations, seismological analyses, and GPS measurements of surface co-seismic displacements, we describe the regional 3-D fault plane and slip distribution of the Chi-Chi earthquake and compare these to the geological features of the Chelungpu fault. We find that one key feature of the Chelungpu fault is the stratigraphy-controlled slip surface: at the level of the uppermost few kilometers, the Chelungpu fault slip plane generally follows the bedding plane of the Pliocene Chinshui shale. The second key feature of the Chelungpu fault is the difference in structurally geometric configuration between its northern and southern segments. The northern Fengyuan segment shows a bedding-parallel thrust fault within east-dipping strata in both footwall and hanging wall. In contrast, the southern Tsaotun segment exhibits east-dipping strata are overthrust onto flat-lying recent alluvial deposits. These two features not only explain a hinterland imbricate thrusting on the hanging-wall of the Fengyuan segment, but also explain the change in strike of the Chi-Chi surface ruptures at the northern end. The southern end of the 1999 Chi-Chi rupture is interpreted to be linked to a series of NW-trending strike-slip faults. In particular, we propose that the Luliao strike-slip fault served as the lateral ramp of the Chelungpu fault, and the Gukeng strike-slip fault acted as a barrier to end the southern propagation of the 1999 rupture. Geomorphic features and paleoseismological data indicate that the range-front Chelungpu fault has aenerated large earthquakes during the last several thousand years. Alternatively, in the Miaoli area to the north and the Chiayi area to south, historical earthquakes as well as active geomorphic features are not restricted on the range-front thrust faults. Instead, more complicated structures, including tightly spaced folds, duplex structures, and strike-slip faults are involved in seismogenic processes. A more detailed investigation of regional structural characteristics is needed for mitigation against the seismic hazards in the 300-km-long active fold belt in western Taiwan, where several damaging large earthquakes have been documented during the last century.

2007.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,The Chiuhsiungken fault A candidate to trigger a hazardous earthquake in western Taiwan,Lin C;Hsu C;Yu T,"The Chiuhsiungken fault located along the boundary between the Western Foothills fold-and-thrust belt and the Coastal Plain in the Chiayi-Yunlin area of Taiwan has been identified as an active thrust through geological and geomorphic investigations. Young geomorphic features provided by shortening across the Chiuhsiungken fault are well preserved and provide excellent examples to illustrate features provided by active thrust faulting. Historic seismicity records show that the deformation front in the Chiayi-Yunlin area is very active, and the fault slips at a rate of mm/yr based on tectonic geomorphic investigation. The Chiuhsiungken fault has the potential to produce large earthquakes in the future. The fault, with a length about 15 km, can be traced northward to the sinistral Kuken transfer fault and southward to near the sinistral Chuchi transfer fault. The maximum potential magnitude of an earthquake triggered by the Chiuhsiungken fault is estimated to be a M-w 6.4. However, the magnitude of the earthquake could be larger than expected if the adjacent faults rupture together with the Chiuhsiungken fault. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

2009.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Foreshock characteristics in Taiwan Potential earthquake warning,Lin C,"Although foreshocks are often considered as a potential precursor in the short-term earthquake prediction, how to identify foreshocks before the mainshock Occurred is a problem. Abundant earthquakes in the Taiwan area might provide a good opportunity for investigating general foreshock characteristic as well as the potential earthquake warning. Here 10 earthquake sequences with significantly felt foreshocks (M(L) >= 4.0) are identified from an examination of 161 earthquakes (M(L) >= 5.0) in the Taiwan area during the period between 1990 and 2004. In addition to addressing larger magnitudes (ML >= 4.0), the criteria for selecting foreshocks have considered that (I) the earthquakes occurred within a distance of 15 km and 5 days to the main shock and (2) focal mechanisms of the main shock and foreshocks were generally consistent. The results show felt foreshocks Often Occurred at the strongly heterogeneous crust, particulary along the convergent zone between the Eurasian and Philippine Sea plates. Besides, the absence Of Clustered earthquakes after some large foreshocks may be considered as a criterion to distinguish felt foreshocks from the main shock for improving our ability of earthquake warnings in the Taiwan area.

2009.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Modeling tsunami hazards from Manila trench to Taiwan,Wu T;Huang H,"The 2006 dual Pingtung earthquake event and the 2004 South Asia tsunami highlighted the potential tsunami hazards from Manila trench. Manila trench is only about 100 km away from Taiwan. therefore one shall punctuate the importance of thorough study on all possible tsunami scenarios for hazard mitigation. Based on the faults parameters issued by USGS and the seismic record from Global CMT, this Study creates a hypothetical earthquake tsunami scenario caused by seismic motion at Manila trench. The magnitude of the earthquake is 9.35 (M-w), the total length is 990 km, and the maximum initial free-surface height is 9.3 m. The initial displacement profile is provided in this paper. An open source code, COMCOT. is adopted to perform the simulation of the tsunami propagation, runup, and inundation around Taiwan. Nested grid system and moving boundary technique are adopted to study runup and inundation. The result shows that the maximum wave height is 11 m in southern Taiwan. Serious flooding is observed in the southwest coast of Taiwan. Tsunami inundation is able to reach 8.5 km inlandward. Due to the refraction effect, 8 m wave height is noted in the northeast coast of Taiwan. The detailed tsunami behavior around Taiwan is described in the context. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

2009.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Origin of methane in higharsenic groundwater of Taiwan Evidence from stable isotope analyses and radiocarbon dating,Liu T;Chen K;Yang T;Chen Y;Chen W;Kang S;Lee C,"Groundwaters in the confined aquifers of the Chianan and Ilan coastal plains of Taiwan are rich in dissolved methane (CH(4)). Serious endemic ""blackfoot disease"", which occurred in the Chianan plain, especially during AD1950-1970, has been demonstrated to have arisen from drinking highly reducing groundwater with abnormal arsenic and humic substance levels. In order to explore the origin of CH(4) and its hydrological implications, stable carbon isotope ratios (delta(13)C) and radiocarbon ((14)C) ages of exsolved CH(4), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and sedimentary biogenic sediments from a total of 34 newly completed water wells at 16 sites were determined. The main results obtained are as follows: (1) The delta(13)C(CH4) (-65 parts per thousand to -75 parts per thousand) values indicate that, except for one thermogenic sample (delta(13)C(CH4) = 38.2 parts per thousand) from the Ilan plain, all CH(4) samples analyzed were produced via microbially mediated CO(2) reduction. Many delta(13)C(DIC) values are considerably greater than -10 parts per thousand and even up to similar to 10 parts per thousand due to Rayleigh enrichment during CO(2) reduction. (2) Almost all the (14)C ages of CH(4) samples from the shallow aquifer (I) (<60 m depth) are greater than the (14)C ages of coexisting DIC and sediments, suggesting the presence of CH4 from underlying aquifers. (3) The (14)C ages of coexisting CH(4), DIC and sediments from aquifer (II) of the Chianan plain are essentially equal, reflecting in-situ generation of CH(4) and DIC from decomposition of sedimentary organic matter and sluggishness of the groundwater flow. On the other hand, both CH(4) and DIC from each individual well of the relatively deep aquifers (III) and (IV) in the Chianan plain are remarkably younger than the deposition of their coexisting sediments, indicating that current groundwaters entered these two aquifers much later than the deposition of aquifer sediments. (4) Each CH(4) sample collected from the Ilan plain is older than coexisting DIC, which in turn is distinctly older than the deposition of respective aquifer sediments, demonstrating the presence of much older CO(2) and CH(4) from underlying strata.

Asian Earth Sci.,Portable broadband seismic network in Vietnam for investigating tectonic deformation the Earths interior and earlywarning systems for earthquakes and tsunamis,Huang B;Le T;Liu C;Toan D;Huang W;Wu Y;Chen Y;Chang W,"As part of a collaborative project involving researchers from the Vietnamese Academy of Science and Technology (Hanoi, Vietnam), National Taiwan University (Taipei, Taiwan), and Academia Sinica (Taipei, Taiwan), a 25-station broadband seismic array was installed in northern Vietnam during December of 2005 with the aim of acquiring a wide dynamic range of seismic data at a high spatial density. The stations were designed to image and interpret crustal and mantle Structures beneath northern Vietnam, including information that Would help to reconstruct the geodynamic evolution of the Red River Fault Zone. Since its deployment, the array has recorded significant local, regional, and teleseismic events. The high-quality distance and azimuth coverage of available events will help LIS to answer questions regarding the nature of deep seismic structures beneath the array and the regional tectonic evolution. As an unexpected bonus, the array recorded near-antipodal seismic waves from significant seismic events in South America, thereby providing valuable seismic data for analysis of the Earth's deep interior. A similar network is planned for South Vietnam in the near future with the aim of studying the deep structure of the South China Sea. The proposed stations are scheduled for upgrades to enable the real-time transmission of data for earthquake monitoring and tsunami warnings for the South China Sea. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

2009.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Seismic velocities density porosity and permeability measured at a deep hole penetrating the Chelungpu fault in central Taiwan,Wang J;Hung J;Dong J,"On September 20, 1999, the M(s)7.6 Chi-Chi earthquake ruptured the Chelungpu fault in central Taiwan. After the earthquake, two deep boreholes cutting the fault were drilled. The seismic velocities (P- and S-wave velocities denoted by v(p) and v(s)) were well-logged at a 2000-m deep hole. The values of density, porosity and permeability of ten rock samples obtained at different depths were measured in the laboratory. Well-logged and measured results are used to study the following problems: (1) the depth variations in seismic velocities, porosity, and permeability; (2) the relationship between P- and S-wave velocities; (3) porosity-dependence of P- and S-wave velocities and their ratio: and (4) porosity-dependence of density. Results show that the polynomial can describe the depth variations in seismic velocities. The porosity slightly decreases with increasing depth. The permeability is depth-dependent and can be described by a polynomial, but the functions are different for different rock types. The porosity and permeability in the fault zone cannot be evaluated from the related depth-dependent functions inferred from wall rocks. A linear relationship, which is different from v(s) = 0.58 v(p) for the perfectly elastic materials, exists between v(s) and v(p). Seismic velocities linearly decrease with increasing porosity. The ratio of v(p) to v(s) slightly depends on the porosity. The porosity-dependent functions of bulk and shear modulus are constructed and their values for dry rocks are also evaluated. (C) 2009.

A network of eight GPS receivers is used to construct daily latitude-time-TEC (LTT) plots to monitor the crest of equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA) in the Taiwan area. Three parameters of the strength, location, and formation time of the EIA crest are extracted. A 15-day running medians of the three parameters and the associated upper and lower quartiles are utilized as the references for identifying abnormal signals for all of the 150M >= 5.0 earthquakes in the Taiwan area during 2001-2007. Results show that the EIA crest significantly moves equatorward (poleward) and appears in an earlier (later) time of the afternoon period a few days before (after) the earthquakes along the Taiwan longitude. The two parameters of the EIA crest location and occurrence time can be employed to detect ionospheric earthquake precursors. The results further imply that atmospheric electric fields generated around the epicenter of a forthcoming earthquake during the preparation period are essential.

2010.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Corich sulfides in mantle peridotites from Penghu Islands Taiwan Footprints of Proterozoic mantle plumes under the Cathaysia Block,Wang K;O'Reilly S;Honda M;Matsumoto T;Griffin W;Pearson N;Zhang M,"Abundant primary sulfides occur as inclusions in silicates and as discrete grains in mantle-derived spinel lherzolite xenoliths from Miocene intraplate basalts on the Penghu Islands, Taiwan, which is located at the southeastern margin of Cathaysia Block. These sulfides are dominantly mixtures of Fe-rich and Ni-rich monosulfide solid solutions (MSS), with minor pentlandite, millerite and chalcopyrite, and are considered to represent sulfide melts crystallized at high temperatures (>900 degrees C). Some sulfides from the Tungchiyu (TCY) islet (37 out of 118 grains) have remarkably high Co contents resulting in subchondritic Ni/Co ratios (<21; 5-20, median = 12), distinct from the superchondritic values (Ni/Co = 48-157, median = 83) typical of mantle sulfides worldwide. The Co-rich nature of the TCY sulfides is considered to be a primary characteristic as no secondary processes can be identified to account for the feature. They are similar to Ni-Co-rich sulfides from Lac de Gras, Slave Craton (Aulbach et al. (2004) Chemical Geology 208, 61-88) interpreted as being derived from the lower mantle. Experimental studies suggest that the sulfide melt/silicate melt partition coefficient of Ni becomes lower than that of Co at pressures greater than 28 GPa, similar to recent estimates of the magma ocean conditions. Os model ages of the TCY Co-rich sulfides reveal four episodes of generation: 2.0, 1.7, 1.4 and 0.8 Ga; this is consistent with the age pattern of all Penghu sulfides, indicating significant lithosperic mantle formation, melt extraction or metasomatic events at these time periods. These events closely correspond to the global 1.9-Ga superplume event related to the assembly of the Nena/Columbia supercontinent, a minor 1.7-Ga superplume event in SW Laurentia prior to breakup of Nena/Columbia, the 1468 Ma Moyie event in the Belt Basin region in western Laurentia and the similar to 0.8 Ga breakup of Rodinia, with which the Cathaysia Block was associated at various stages during its Proterozoic evolution (Li et al. (2008) Precambrian Research 160, 179-210 and references therein). Olivine in a peridotite sample from the TCY locality has distinctly high He-3/He-4 (11 R-A), whereas other peridotites from the KP and TCY localities have He-3/He-4 similar to 6.7 R-A, lower than MORB. The high He-3/He-4 further suggests that materials from the deep mantle have interacted with the host peridotite of Co-rich sulfides. We thus propose that the Co-rich sulfide melts may have been trapped in the lower mantle during core-mantle differentiation and then transported to shallow depths by mantle plumes that entrained lower mantle materials at several different time periods. This study provides the first substantial evidence from the lithosperic mantle beneath the Cathaysia Block to support the activity of mantle plumes related to the breakup of the supercontinents Nena/Columbia and Rodinia in Proterozoic time.

2010.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Highresolution sequence stratigraphic analysis of Late Quaternary deposits of the Changhua Coastal Plain in the frontal arccontinent collision belt of Central Taiwan,Chen H;Lee T;Wu L,"Detailed analysis of the sequence stratigraphy in 30 cores from the Late Quaternary deposits of the Changhua Coastal Plain provides a 25 ka record of the depositional history of a region situated in the frontal arc-continent collision belt of Taiwan. Twenty-five lithofacies and nine facies associations are recognized. An alluvial plain was the dominant feature during a pronounced sea-level fall at 25-20 ka ago. Between 20 and 10 ka, alluvial fans were deposited along the western front of the Pakua Tableland during movement along the Changhua Fault, and a local sag basin was produced. No other deposits in the seaward area are recognized between 20 and 16 ka, or in the landward area between 20 and 10 ka. Between 16 and 6 ka, the Changhua Coastal Plain experienced rising sea level and retrogradational deposition. From 16 to 10 ka, estuarine deposits (lower transgressive systems tract) were deposited, and the base of these deposits defines the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) unconformity (sequence boundary), now preserved in four regions to the east of the plain. From 10 to 6 ka, shelf, shoreface, and lagoonal deposits (upper transgressive systems tract) were laid either on top of the estuarine deposits or directly on the LGM unconformity surface. By about 7-6 ka, sea level had reached its peak (maximum flooding surface), and shelf and marginal marine sediments covered most of the study area. After 6 ka, the highstand was dominated by progradation of offshore-transition, shoreface, lagoonal, tidal channel, tidal flat and alluvial plain deposits. One-thousand-year-old fluvial deposits in incised channels are preserved in the central part of the Changhua Coastal Plain. Since then, fluvial channels shifted southward to the present-day Chuoshuei River. The depositional patterns in this tectonically active area during the last interglacial period reflect the complex interplay between high-frequency sea-level fluctuations, tectonics (subsidence and uplift), and autocyclic processes. In the seaward area, however, fluctuations in sea level were clearly the dominant factor in controlling the nature of depositional facies. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

2010.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Moho depth variation in Taiwan from teleseismic receiver functions,Wang H;Zhu L;Chen H,"We determine lateral variation of Moho discontinuity, crustal thickness, and Vp/Vs ratios in the vicinity of Taiwan by analyzing all the available teleseismic waveform data collected by the Broadband Array in Taiwan for Seismology network from 1998 to 2004. The crustal thickness and the average crustal Vp/Vs ratio beneath each station are obtained by stacking Ps, PpPs and PpSs + PsPs phases coherently. The best estimated crustal thickness of Taiwan from 27 broadband stations is 30 km on average. The thinnest crust (11-15 km) is found east of the Longitude Valley suture zone, as part of the oceanic crust of the Philippine Sea plate. In other places. the crustal thickness varies from 17-19 km in northern Taiwan to 32-39 km in the southwestern island. The deepest Moho is found to be 53 km beneath station SSLB in central Taiwan. The average crustal Vp/Vs ratio in Taiwan is 1.74, with higher values of 1.74-1.99 in the north and lower values of 1.60-1.74 in the south. The crustal thickness variation is supported by gravity measurements in Taiwan and indicates that the collision between the Philippine Sea plate and Eurasian plate in Taiwan involves the whole crust. The thin crust and high Vp/Vs ratios in northern Taiwan are believed to be related to the volcanism in Tatun and Keelung located in the southwestern extent of the Okinawa Trough.

2010.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Origins of Taiwans mud volcanoes Evidence from geochemistry,Sun C;Chang S;Kuo C;Wu J;Shao P;Oung J,"The supply of natural gas from mud volcanoes is commonly attributed to the migration of gas-bearing fluids from a deeper source area. However, the relative importance of these gas sources is not well known. Onshore mud volcanoes in Taiwan are mainly located in the Foothills of southwestern Taiwan and in the Coastal Range of eastern Taiwan, generally along structurally weak zones. Geochemical analyses of gases and sediments from 17 mud volcanoes were undertaken in this study. Using molecular and stable isotopic compositions, hydrocarbon gases were characterized by type and source maturity. Source rock assessments and nanofossil analyses were carried out to evaluate the potential, and to infer the origin of sediments. A particular effort was directed towards determining the genetic relationships between mud volcanic gas and associated sediments. Gases from Taiwan's mud volcanoes are predominantly CH4-enriched, with the exception of a few mud volcanoes where CO2 predominates. The origins of hydrocarbon gases in these systems range from microbial to thermally over-mature sources; while, excess CO2 may be derived from an inorganic origin as indicated by measured delta C-13(CO2) values. The integration of geochemistry and local geology has yielded models with which to evaluate possible mechanisms for the formation of mud volcanoes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

2010.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Residual luminescence in modern debris flow deposits from western Taiwan A single grain approach,Wu T;Jaiswal M;Lin Y;Chen Y;Chen Y,"In an active fold-and-thrust belt, sediment is commonly transported in the form of debris and colluviums, and the ages of such deposits can be important for seismic hazard assessment These sediments are mainly transported by high concentration flows that travel very short distances before burial, and therefore have very few opportunities for daylight exposure and bleaching, which limits the application of luminescence dating in such environments. Luminescence studies on modern debris flow deposits and channel sediments in central Taiwan indicate a mixed population of bleached and unbleached grains The well bleached grains constitute a small proportion of the sediments and could only be identified using the single grain dating technique, doing single aliquot analysis may result in overestimation of the age of such sediments by 3-25 ka. The data reveal that outwash sediments are better bleached than debris flow sediments Our results show that quartz that has experienced partial resetting can be used for luminescence dating only through the use of the single grain technique (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved","Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,INDIA,5,1.0,1.0,"Jaiswal, MK (corresponding author), Indian Inst Sci Educ & Res Kolkata IISER K, Dept Earth Sci, Mohanpur Campus, Nadia 741246, W Bengal, India.","National Science Council and Central Geological Survey, Taiwan [NSC94-2119-M-002-002, NSC95-2119-M-002-041]","This study is financially supported by National Science Council and Central Geological Survey, Taiwan under Grant numbers NSC94-2119-M-002-002 and NSC95-2119-M-002-041.",Optical dating; SAR; OSL dating; Single grain OSL dating; Debris flow in Taiwan,10.1016/j.jseaes.2010.02.002,Article,OPTICALLY STIMULATED LUMINESCENCE; DOSE DISTRIBUTIONS; FLUVIAL DEPOSITS; QUARTZ; EARTHQUAKE; THERMOLUMINESCENCE; LIQUEFACTION; SEDIMENTS; FAULT; OSL,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES,7,38,ISI,NATL TAIWAN UNIV,INDIAN INST SCI EDUC AND RES KOLKATA IISER K,B2
2010.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Zircon LAICPMS UPb ages and Hf isotopes of Huayu Penghu Islands volcanics in the Taiwan Strait and tectonic implication,Chen C;Hsieh P;Wang K;Yang H;Lin W;Liang Y;Lee C;Yang H,"Huayu, the only non-basalt islet in the Penghu Islands, consists mainly of andesite lavas intruded by some intermediate (dacite/granodiorite) and felsic (rhyolite/granite) dikes. The LA-ICPMS U-Pb zircon age determination yields 437 +/- 13 Ma (n = 16, MSWD = 6.9) for the andesite lava and 63.3 +/- 1.5 Ma (n = 7; MSWD = 2.9) for its potassic altered zone, and 58.7 +/- 0.8 Ma (n = 14: MSWD = 2.5) for one rhyolite dike. The old and young groups of zircon show distinctive Hf isotope compositions: epsilon Hf-(T) = -9 for similar to 437 Ma zircons vs. epsilon Hf-(T) = +9 to +6 and +9 to -1 for similar to 63 Ma and similar to 59 Ma zircons. On the other hand, Sr and Nd isotopic compositions of the andesite lava (ISr = 0.7034 and epsilon Nd-(T) = +3.9 if T = 437 Ma) are more depleted than the alteration zone and rhyolite dike (ISr = 0.7051 and epsilon Nd-(T) = -1.3 to -1.9). Decoupling of zircon epsilon Hf-(T) and whole-rock epsilon Nd-(T) values of the andesite lava rules out the possibility of 437 +/- 13 Ma to be the eruption time. Alternatively, based on the similarity between the published zircon fission track ages (65 +/- 3 Ma for the andesite lava and 61 +/- 2 Ma for the rhyolite dike; [Yang, H.C., Chen, W.S., Huang, J.C., Wang Lee, C.M., 2008. Volcanic lithofacies of the Huayu Island. Bulletin of Central Geological Survey 21, 143-164 (in Chinese with English Abstract)]) and our U-Pb zircon ages of the altered andesite zone and rhyolite dike, the span of 65-63 Ma is suggested to be the formation time of Huayu andesites. Since Huayu is situated in a NE-SW trending high-magnetic anomaly belt which has been generally interpreted as a remnant magmatic terrain, these data, along with the geochemical results, provide insights of this belt as a split part of the Southeast Coast Magmatic Belt in which Huayu volcanics represent the younger arc volcanism comparable with those appeared in southern Fujian.

2011.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,3D topography of the Moho discontinuity in the Taiwan area as extracted from travel time inversion of PmP phases,Hsu H;Wen S;Chen C,"The reflective signals are often used to find a particular reflective interface. Therefore, we used the travel time of the PmP phase to investigate the Moho depth beneath Taiwan in this study. We used the directionality and rectilinearity functions to increase the accuracy and the convenience of the PmP phase identification. In all, we selected 1054 earthquakes with 13,715 travel time data of the PmP phase to invert the attitude of the Moho discontinuity. From the results, we offer these conclusions: (1) The distribution of the Moho depth in Taiwan trends NNE-SSW, which is consistent with the topography. (2) The deepest part of the Moho discontinuity is beneath the Central Mountain Range, 38 km in depth. And the depth of the Moho discontinuity beneath the Peikang Basement High is only 26 km. (3) The Western Coastal Plain is divided into an active continental margin and a passive continental margin by the Peikang Basement High. (4) The Moho depth beneath the northern part of the Coastal Range is deeper than the southern part because of more vigorous collision activity. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

2011.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Climate changes inferred from integrated multisite pollen data in northern Taiwan,Wang L;Wu J;Lee T;Lee P;Chen S,"In this study, we synthesized the fossil pollen data from 10 lake sediments and 2 land cores to integrate the alteration of forest covered areas in northern Taiwan with changes in humidity and temperature over the last 2000 years. The abundance of arboreal pollen, fern spores and Tsuga pollen in the pollen and spore assemblages were used as indicators. Our results suggested that the climate in northern Taiwan was stably cool and dry during 2000-1000 cal. yr BP, but changed to wet and warm during 1000-500 cal. yr BP, which corresponded to the Medieval Warm Period (MWP). In addition, an increased density and dispersal of Tsuga pollen corresponding to 500-200 cal. yr BP was observed, which corresponded to the Little Ice Age (LIA). In recent years, a decline in Tsuga pollen density and increased fern spore density has been observed, which indicates an increase in temperature associated with elevated rainfall. Based on the synthesized data set, we conducted GIS mapping of such changes in the north of Taiwan over time. The results revealed that the temporal and spatial climate changes could be inferred from the palynological GIS mapping method, and that the fluctuations in temperature over time matched well with the global climate events, including MWP, LIA and recent warming.

The azimuthal variation from the BATS array center to both ends of the rupture fault is approximately 21 degrees, which is larger than that reported previously for seismic arrays used to image the rupture process of this earthquake, thereby providing a high spatial resolution in studying the source rupture behavior.. Two array-processing methods were used to analyze teleseismic P-wave trains. Both analyses were based on data recorded by a broadband network, covering a region of 200 x 400 km, with the aim of evaluating the rupture behavior of the earthquake. Consistent results from both analyses indicate that the earthquake had a rupture duration exceeding 500 s, with major asperities encountered at 80,260, and 330 s after the initiation of rupturing. We traced the ruptured fault for more than 1200 km from the point of initial rupture.

2011.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Groundwaterseawater interactions off the coast of southern Taiwan Evidence from environmental isotopes,Lin I;Wang C;Lin S;Chen Y,"We have conducted detailed hydrochemical surveys off the Pingtung Plain coast, SW Taiwan, using environmental isotope compositions (delta D, delta O-18, delta C-13(DIC), tritium, and Delta C-14) as the main tracers to investigate groundwater-seawater interactions in the region. The delta O-18 values of seawater in this area show significant variability with heavy isotope enrichment relatively to groundwater. The delta D and delta O-18 data also confirmed that submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) originated from meteoric water and were mixed with seawater. Due to an overdraft of groundwater, seawater has intruded inwardly through the offshore outcrops for both the unconfined and confined aquifers at a depth of 300 m. However, delta O-18-depleted layer is found along deep parts of Kaoping Canyon. This result provides evidence for SGD in this region. This phenomenon is also reflected in depleted delta C-13(DIC) and lower Delta C-14 values in deep canyon water than in adjacent seawater, and indicating that the discharge zone extends over a considerable distance to the offshore area (similar to 25 km). Based on these three parameters (delta O-18, delta C-13(DIC) and Delta C-14), we used two end-member mixing model to estimate that fresh submarine groundwater constitute. The submarine fresh groundwater contributed about 3%, and the estimated submarine fresh groundwater discharge was calculated as 4.5 x 10(9) m(3) per year. This result is comparable with groundwater annual loss in the Pingtung Plain. As documented by the isotopic composition of the collected samples, detailed results show that SGD in the Pingtung coastal zone raises a potential environmental concern and provides implication for the management of groundwater resource in the region.

2011.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Mineralogical and geochemical investigations of sedimentsource region changes in the Okinawa Trough during the past 100 ka IMAGES core MD012404,Chen H;Chang Y;Kao S;Chen M;Song S;Kuo L;Wen S;Yang T;Lee T,"We present a mineralogical and geochemical study of core MD012404, retrieved from the central Okinawa Trough (OT) of the East China Sea. Our studies reveal that the sediment sources of the core have been changed through time during the past 100 ka. Our mineralogical proxies indicate that the sediments source from the Yangtze River correlates well sea-level changes before 24 ka. Our Ti/Al ratios otherwise indicate an increase of sediment supply from eastern Taiwan after 26 ka. The cooler climate of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 23 similar to 19 ka) led to a reduction in fluvial sediments from the Yangtze River.

Our studies reveal that the sediment sources of the core have been changed through time during the past 100 ka. Our mineralogical proxies indicate that the sediments source from the Yangtze River correlates well sea-level changes before 24 ka. Our Ti/Al ratios otherwise indicate an increase of sediment supply from eastern Taiwan after 26 ka. The cooler climate of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 23~19 ka) led to a reduction in fluvial sediments from the Yangtze River. However, subsequent climate warming (after ~19 ka) resulted in an abrupt increase in fluvial sediments. After the LGM, the Kuroshio intrusion flow into the OT may have increased.

2011.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Normalizing XRFscanner data A cautionary note on the interpretation of highresolution records from organicrich lakes,Lowemark L;Chen H;Yang T;Kylander M;Yu E;Hsu Y;Lee T;Song S;Jarvis S,"X-ray fluorescence (XRF) scanning of unlithified, untreated sediment cores is becoming an increasingly common method used to obtain paleoproxy data from lake records. XRF-scanning is fast and delivers high-resolution records of relative variations in the elemental composition of the sediment. However, lake sediments display extreme variations in their organic matter content, which can vary from just a few percent to well over 50%. As XRF scanners are largely insensitive to organic material in the sediment, increasing levels of organic material effectively dilute those components that can be measured, such as the lithogenic material (the closed-sum effect). Consequently, in sediments with large variations in organic material, the measured variations in an element will to a large extent mirror the changes in organic material. It is therefore necessary to normalize the elements in the lithogenic component of the sediment against a conservative element to allow changes in the input of the elements to be addressed. In this study we show that Al, which is the lightest element that can be measured using the Wax XRF-scanner, can be used to effectively normalize the elements of the lithogenic fraction of the sediment against variations in organic content. We also show that care must be taken when choosing resolution and exposure time to ensure optimal output from the measurements. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

2011.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Origin of native sulfur ball from the Kueishantao hydrothermal field offshore northeast Taiwan Evidence from trace and rare earth element composition,Zeng Z;Chen C;Yin X;Zhang X;Wang X;Zhang G;Wang X;Chen D,"We first report the trace and rare earth element compositions of native sulfur ball with sulfur contents varying from 97.08 wt.% to 99.85 wt.% from the Kueishantao hydrothermal field, off NE Taiwan. We then discuss the sources of trace and rare earth elements incorporated into the native sulfur ball during formation. Comparison of our results with native sulfur from crater lakes and other volcanic areas shows the sulfur content of native sulfur ball from the Kueishantao hydrothermal field is very high, and that the rare earth element (REE) and trace element constituents of the native sulfur balls are very low (Sigma REE < 35 ppb). In the native sulfur ball, V, Cr, Co, Ni, Nb, Rb, Cs, Ba, Pb, Th, U. Al, Ti and REE are mostly derived from andesite; Mg, K and Mn are mostly derived from seawater; and Fe, Cu, Zn and Ni are partly derived from magma. Based on the sulfur contents, trace and rare earth element compositions, and local environment, we suggest that the growth of the native sulfur ball is significantly slower than that of native sulfur chimneys, which results in the relatively higher contents of trace and rare earth element contents in the native sulfur ball than in the native sulfur chimneys from the Kueishantao hydrothermal field. Finally, we suggest a ""glue pudding"" growth model for understanding the origin of the native sulfur ball in the Kueishantao hydrothermal field, whereby the native sulfur ball forms from a mixture of oxygenated seawater and acidic, low-temperature hydrothermal fluid with H2S and SO2 gases, and is subsequently shaped by tidal and/or bottom currents.

2011.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Significant crustal structural variation across the Chaochou Fault southern Taiwan New tectonic implications for convergent plate boundary,Tang C;Zhu L;Chen C;Teng T,"The Chaochou Fault, a major geological boundary in southern Taiwan is considered to be a part of the convergent plate boundary between the Eurasia Plate and the Philippine Sea Plate. We applied the Common Conversion Point stacking technique to teleseismic radial receiver functions and obtained Moho variation and crustal structure across the Chaochou Fault. In the Eurasia Plate to its west, the Moho depth is about 37 km and the crust is subducting to the east beneath the Philippine Sea Plate with a dip angle of about 30 degrees between the Backbone Belt and the Tananao Schist. In the Philippine Sea Plate, the Moho depth is about 17 km. The Longitudinal Valley marks the collision boundary between the Eurasia Plate and the Philippine Sea Plate. The results suggest that the depth extent of the Chaochou Fault is about 30-35 km and the fault becomes a ""shallow-angle"" thrust fault at depth. The Common Conversion Point image also shows several bending interfaces of velocity contrast in the crust. We proposed a simple model to explain the Philippine Sea Plate and Eurasia Plate collision process and the observed crustal deformations. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

2011.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Source variability of sediments in the Shihmen Reservoir Northern Taiwan Sr isotopic evidence,Liu H;You C;Chung C;Huang K;Liu Z,"High turbidity in water reservoirs during the monsoon season has caused serious problems for drinking water quality in Taiwan. In this study, we collected stream waters and streambed sediments, including bed loads and fresh landslide deposits, in the Dahan Stream and analyzed 101 (87)Sr/(86)Sr ratios in different grain-size fractions in the streambed sediments from the upper catchment and 3 sediment cores from the Shihmen Reservoir, as well as dissolved major and trace elements in stream waters, to identify possible changes of sediment sources in the reservoir. The (87)Sr/(86)Sr ratios in stream water and streambed sediments ranged from 0.71296-0.71349 and 0.71714-0.71843, respectively. The large Sr isotopic difference between the paired stream water and streambed sediments are evidence for disequilibrium water/rock interaction in the weathering limited regions. The Sr isotopic compositions in bulk sediments and various grain-size fractions showed no clear spatial variability. However, there is an interesting relationship between grain sizes and Sr isotope ratios, implying effects of mineral sorting during sediment transportation. The illite crystallinity and the illite chemistry index of streambed sediment suggest moderate to strong chemical weathering in this regions. The dissolved constituents in the Dahan stream support that silicate weathering is the predominated controlled mechanism and only minor carbonate dissolution occurred near the Central Mountain Range. The (87)Sr/(86)Sr ratios in the sediment cores suggest that modern reservoir sediment is mainly derived from the upper watershed, composed of primarily Oligocene sedimentary rocks. However, the sediment sources have changed significantly since the reservoir built 37 years ago, the (87)Sr/(86)Sr ratios were spread widely outside the present-day observations in the Dahan catchment. The homogeneous distribution of (87)Sr/(86)Sr in the upper reservoir cores reflected disturbance due to recent turbidity events within the reservoir. These new chemical and isotopic data provide useful spatial and temporal information of weathering sources in a high denudation sub-tropical mountainous watershed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

2011.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Tectonic erosion and the removal of forearc lithosphere during arccontinent collision Evidence from recent earthquake sequences and tomography results in eastern Taiwan,Shyu J;Wu Y;Chang C;Huang H,"A very common but important observation of collided and accreted volcanic arcs is that the forearc regions of these arcs are largely or even entirely missing. The processes and mechanisms responsible for the removal and transport of the forearc materials from the collisional belts are thus important issues in understanding tectonics and crustal growth. The young and ongoing collision between the Luzon volcanic arc and the Eurasian continental margin that forms the island of Taiwan provides a rare opportunity to examine these processes and mechanisms as they occur. From observations of a new detailed 3-D tomography combined with relocated hypocenters of two earthquake sequences occurred in 2003 and 2006, we found that the Luzon forearc lithosphere initially underthrusts westward after the collision began. As the collision proceeds, the forearc basement then subducts eastward beneath the colliding and accreting Luzon arc along a major fault system in eastern Taiwan. Thus the Luzon forearc lithosphere appears to be removed by tectonic erosion and is being transported eastward into the mantle. Our results from the active Taiwan orogen will provide important insights for interpreting rock records from many old arc-continent collisional belts in the world. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Asian Earth Sci.,The effect of typhoon induced rainfall on settling fluxes of particles and organic carbon in Yuanyang Lake subtropical Taiwan,Yang T;Lee T;Meyers P;Fan C;Chen R;Wei K;Chen Y;Wu J,"A sediment-trap monitoring program measured the fluxes of settling particles and organic carbon in Yuanyang Lake, northern Taiwan, from July 2004 to July 2006 and assessed their relations to the amounts of normal monthly and typhoon-event precipitation. The flux of settling particles varied from 0.7 mg cm(-2) month(-1) to 14.7 mg cm-2 month-1, and the monthly precipitation ranged from 56 mm to 1218 mm during the survey period. The contributions from typhoon-event precipitation to monthly rainfall amounts were generally larger than 70%. Higher inputs of both particulate and organic carbon into the lake were found during typhoon seasons. Of the annual settling particle loading of 14.9 tons year(-1) to the lake floor, 69% occurred during the typhoon months, and 62% of the annual organic carbon loading of 2.3 tons year(-1) happened during the typhoon months. These results show the importance of typhoon events on the fluxes of settling particles and organic carbon and their delivery to lakes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The composite horizontal peak amplitude data used in this study is comprised a total of 202 amplitude records from 14 broadband stations, which measure 36 shallow earthquakes with focal depths less than 36 km, occurred in and around north-western Vietnam during 01/2006-10/2007. The new distance-correction function obtained in this' study is - logA(0) = 1.74 log(r) + 0.00048r - 0.522, where A(0) and r are the empirically determined distance correction and hypocentral distance, respectively. This distance-correction relation for Northern Vietnam is quite similar to one for southern California, implying relative efficient attenuation with distances. The correlation between the new M-L and duration magnitudes (M-d), which is still being used for making the official earthquake bulletin in Vietnam, is expressed as M-L = 0.955M(d) + 0.17.

Asian Earth Sci.,A seismicity burst following the 2010 M 64 Jiashian earthquake implications for shortterm seismic hazards in southern Taiwan,Chan C;Wu Y,"Following the 4 March 2010 M-W 6.4 Jiashian earthquake the seismicity rate in southern Taiwan was determined to be significantly higher than before the quake and aroused seismic hazard awareness. In this work, seismic hazards were investigated in terms of earthquake activity, the Coulomb stress change, the rate-and-state friction model, and short-term seismic hazard assessments. The significantly higher seismicity rate that followed the 2010 Jiashian earthquake was found to mainly be attributed to aftershock decay, in terms of the modified Omori formula. The results suggest that aftershock duration may continue until the end of 2012. The spatial migration of seismicity was modeled using the Coulomb stress changes of large earthquakes. Most of the consequent events were distributed in the vicinity of large earthquakes. The observations corresponded to a remarkable stress increase within the same area. Additionally, large events were located within regions with stress increases promoted by previous earthquakes. The results confirm interactive relationships between large events. By considering time-dependency, the seismicity rate evolution was estimated using the rate-and-state friction model. The results indicated that a high seismic rate will persist at least until the end of 2012. Short-term probabilistic seismic hazard assessments were also applied in terms of the probability of strong ground motion. Using this application, a sudden jump in seismic hazards in southern Taiwan was accompanied by each large earthquake. At the end of 2012 it is expected that hazards will return to a background level.

Our findings point out to a significant discrimination among these data in terms of multifractal characteristics of the signals, indicating a strong influence of the environmental settings of the measurement sites on the temporal fluctuations of magnetic field H.

2012.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Boron sources and transport mechanisms in river waters collected from southwestern Taiwan Isotopic evidence,Liu Y;You C;Huang K;Wang R;Chung C;Liu H,"Boron (B) isotopes are sensitive tracers for constraining water-rock interactions and pollution sources in river systems. In this study, we analyzed delta B-11 using multi-collector inductive coupled plasma mass spectrometry, in addition to major and trace elements, to delineate B sources and transport mechanisms in two river catchments, the largest Kao-ping River and the most polluted Erren River in southwestern Taiwan. Dissolved delta B-11 values vary more than 35 parts per thousand in Kao-ping River, but keep relatively constant in Erren River, 12.2-26.7 parts per thousand. Four major B sources identified in these river waters are cyclic seasalt, water/rock interaction, geothermal water and anthropogenic inputs. All specimens collected near the estuaries were influenced strongly by the seawater, B = 4.5 mg/L and delta B-11 = 39.5 parts per thousand. The Erren River results provide unique information on B and delta B-11 compositions in anthropogenic sources, in particular for fertilizer and hog manure, characterized with high B (up to 3.43 mg/L) and intermediate delta B-11 (average 13 parts per thousand). The low delta B-11 values in 2006 Kao-ping River are attributed to contributions from local geothermal inputs, average 2.5 ppm and 2 parts per thousand, prior to massive landslides caused by 2009 Morakot typhoon. Mass balance calculations suggest that major contribution of B in river waters was derived from silicate weathering, characterized by low B and intermediate delta B-11, contributed approximately 49-97% in 2010 Kao-ping River. The detected changes of delta B-11 (Delta(w-rock)) reaches a maximum variation of 18 parts per thousand during chemical weathering in catchment and highlights the importance of water/rock interaction enhancement after major climatic events.

2012.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Clay mineralogy and geochemistry investigations in the host rocks of the Chelungpu fault Taiwan Implication for faulting mechanism,Kuo L;Song S;Yeh E;Chen H;Si J,"The Chelungpu fault, with northward propagating ruptures, was ruptured as a result of the M-w 7.6 earthquake which struck Central Taiwan on 21st September 1999. To understand the consequences of clays in fault gouges, we examined the clay mineralogy and major element geochemistry of the ""host rocks"" of the Chelungpu fault from four outcrops, shallow boreholes at Fengyuan (455.3 m in depth), Nantou (211.9 m in depth), and a deep borehole of the Taiwan Chelungpu fault Drilling Project (2003 m in depth). Results revealed different degrees of chemical weathering, the intensity, as documented by differences in the smectite content, could be further understood through the relative clay percentage of smectite, illite chemistry index, and illite crystallinity. These mineralogical proxies combined with the chemical index of alteration (CIA) and the intensity of chemical weathering indicate that the degree of chemical weathering is a function of depth, i.e., the most severe on the surface and the mildest in the TCDP samples. The mineralogical and geochemical data obtained in this study also suggest that chemical weathering, rather than leaching, seems to be the main driving force for the phase changes of clays. The amount of smectite produced by chemical weathering varies with depth, and it suggests that the previous idea of weak-fault caused by the presence of smectite in the fault zone will be risky without considering weathering processes. The observations of clay mineralogy and major element geochemistry in this study indicate that the presence of smectite in the outcrops may not play a significant role during faulting, and suggest that fault-weakening as a result of the presence of smectite cannot be applied to the Chelungpu fault.

Asian Earth Sci.,Geochemical and SrNd isotopic constraints on the genesis of the Cenozoic Linzizong volcanic successions southern Tibet,Lee H;Chung S;Ji J;Qian Q;Gallet S;Lo C;Lee T;Zhang Q,"The Linzizong volcanic successions that crop out in the Lhasa terrane, southern Tibet have been conventionally regarded as the products of northward subduction of the Neotethyan oceanic slab beneath South Asia. This study reports geochemical data of 100+ volcanic rocks from the Lhasa terrane to better constrain the temporal-spatial distribution and petrogenesis of the Linzizong volcanism. The Linzizong volcanic successions consist dominantly of calc-alkaline rocks that erupted from ca. 69 to 43 Ma and show typical arc-lava geochemical features marked with LILE enrichment and HFSE depletion in the spidergram. Their Sr and Nd isotope ratios [epsilon(Nd)(T) = +3.3 to -2.4; I-Sr = 0.7048-0.7072] are generally similar to those of the associated Gangdese I-type granitoids. The Linzizong volcanism is characterized by a flare-up period (ca. 50 Ma) that shows significant geochemical variations, manifested by the coexistence of five types of volcanic rocks: (1) the main suite of calc-alkaline rocks [SiO2 = 45-80 wt.%; La = 12-45 ppm; epsilon(Nd)(T) = +3.8 to -4.9; I-Sr = 0.7037-0.7105] that could be interpreted by partial melting of the mantle wedge followed by assimilation and fractional crystallization (AFC) processes with >10% crustal contamination and/or magma mixing; (2) the low-K, low-REE suite (SiO2 = 48-61 wt.%; K2O = 0.5-1.1 wt.%; La = 7-10 ppm) that has the highest Nd isotope ratios [epsilon(Nd)(T) = +5.9 to 3.5], suggesting a juvenile mantle origin possibly related to decompression melting of the asthenosphere; (3) the shoshonitic suite [SiO2 = 53-71 wt.%; K2O = 3.8-6.7 wt.%; epsilon(Nd)(T) = -2.8 to -6.1] from small-degree melting of the metasomatized lithospheric mantle; (4) the high-REE suite [SiO2 = 61-75 wt.%; La =36-87 ppm; epsilon(Nd)(T)= -2.6 to -3.2] originating from remelting of a newly underplated basaltic lower crust; and (5) the evolved suite of rhyolitic flows and ignimbrites (SiO2 > 65 wt.%) that have the lowest epsilon(Nd)(T) values of -14 to -18, representing remelting products of the basement or continental crust of the Lhasa terrane. Such geochemical heterogeneities are attributed to breakoff of the subducted Neotethyan slab under southern Tibet that occurred in the early stage of the India-Asia collision. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

2012.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Lithological control on shearwave velocity anisotropy in core samples from the Taiwan Chelungpu Fault Drilling Project,Humbert F;Louis L;Barnes C;Robion P;David C;Song S,"The present study provides laboratory constrains on the in situ source of shear wave birefringence in siltstone and sandstone lithologies from the Taiwan Chelungpu Fault Drilling Project (TCDP). Bench top measurements at ambient pressure and temperature are performed across the end faces of vertically drilled samples while the polarization angle of the source and receiver is rotated from 0 to 360 degrees in azimuth. Shear wave birefringence in siltstone is low (similar to 3.5%) and controlled by low angle (similar to 30 degrees) bedding dip. The sandstone samples exhibit moderate (similar to 15%) shear wave anisotropy due to a network of vertical microcracks with normal about the bedding strike direction. As related studies infer that the microcracks responsible for shear wave birefringence in sandstone are also open at depth, our results suggest that anisotropy in borehole measurements can simply be accounted for by the observed siltstone and sandstone microstructures, i.e., without invoking larger scale objects, nor randomly oriented cracks/fractures subjected to triaxial stress state.

2012.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Miocene shallowmarine cold seep carbonate in foldandthrust Western Foothills SW Taiwan,Chien C;Huang C;Chen Z;Lee H;Harris R,"A mound-shaped authigenic carbonate buildup (50 m wide and 5 m high) occurred in the middle part of the Late Miocene shallow marine succession (the Hunghuatzu Formation) exposed along the Nantzuhsien River, SW Taiwan. The carbonate concretions are classified into four types based on morphology, which appeared to develop in upward sequence with vague boundaries: (1) flat-pipe shaped nodules: highly dolomitic small pipes or nodules subparallel to the host strata, (2) bulb-shaped nodules: discrete or combined small mesoclots with subspherical to irregular shapes, (3) mushroom-shaped concretions: large mushroom-like or irregular shaped blocks with chimney or vent structures, and (4) carbonated layers with sedimentary structures. These concretions are mainly composed of dolomite micrites, quartz, feldspar, muscovite, and clay minerals, ubiquitously interweaved with blackish brown colored low magnesium calcite (LMC) veins. Low (delta C-13(VPDB) values (-51.8 parts per thousand to -29.8 parts per thousand) of all types of the carbonates reveal that the carbonates were mainly derived from anaerobic oxidation of hydrocarbons. Many samples are also O-18-depleted (delta O-18(VPDB): -11.5 parts per thousand to 1.00 parts per thousand) due to the mixture with isotopically light LMC veins, likely precipitated from meteoric waters. There are numerous chemosymbiotic bivalve fossils (genus Monitilora? diameter 3-4 cm) in growth position just above the carbonate buildup. According to the geological and isotopic signatures, the Hunghuatzu carbonates are related to a cold seep pseudobioherm, which formed in a very shallow marine environment like tidal-flat in a passive margin setting. Exposures of the Hunghuatzu pseudobioherm may provide clues for tracking and comparing the evolution history of gas reservoir systems and hints of active tectonics of the SW Taiwan region.

2012.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Plate coupling along the Manila subduction zone between Taiwan and northern Luzon,Hsu Y;Yu S;Song T;Bacolcol T,"We use GPS data, trench parallel gravity anomaly (TPGA), and bathymetry to infer plate coupling patterns along the Manila subduction zone. Using a block model and a fault geometry constrained by seismicity, we simultaneously solve for the location of Euler pole and angular velocity between the Sunda and Luzon blocks as well as the slip-deficit rate on plate interface. Our estimates show that the Euler pole between the Sunda and Luzon blocks is situated at southern Palawan near 8.3 degrees N and 119.4 degrees E with the angular velocity of 4.6 Myr(-1). The estimated convergence rate along the Manila Trench continuously decreases southward from 91 mm/yr at the northern tip of Luzon to 55 mm/yr north of Mindoro. The inversion of GPS data reveals partially locked fault patches extending from the West Luzon Trough to the east of Scarborough Seamount chain. The slip-deficit rate in this region is in the range of 20-30 mm/yr corresponding to a coupling ratio of 0.4. However, the fault slip behavior is not well resolved near the North Luzon Trough. Based on a good correlation between locations of large subduction zone earthquakes and areas possessing gravity low, we investigate a variety of TPGA-based plate coupling models assuming different scaling between TPGA values and plate coupling ratios. The TPGA-based plate coupling models offer plausible rupture scenarios which are not constrained by current GPS data. The partially locked fault zone near 15-16.5 degrees N may be associated with the subducted Scarborough Seamount wherein oceanic floor is highly fractured. The great subduction zone earthquake propagates beneath the Scarborough Seamount seems to be unlikely.

Asian Earth Sci.,Reexamining the source parameters of the 2010 M L 64 JiaSian Taiwan earthquake using the inversion of teleseismic Pwaves,Hwang R;Lin T;Wu C;Chang W;Chang J,"A moderate-sized earthquake (M L=6.4), named the 2010 JiaSian earthquake, occurred in southern Taiwan on March 4, 2010. Reports from several institutes indicated that the JiaSian earthquake had focal depths of 18-28km and ruptures with a thrust mechanism. However, modeling of teleseismic P-waves in previously reported source parameters revealed significant differences between the observed and synthetic P-waves. Therefore, this study reexamined the source parameters of the 2010 JiaSian earthquake using a teleseismic P-wave inversion method. The inversion showed that the earthquake had a depth of 22km, a best double couple of 304°/28°/48° and 170°/70°/110° (strike/dip/rake), and a seismic moment of 2.31×10 18Nm (M W=6.2). Rupture directivity analysis also suggested that the earthquake was a unilateral faulting event on the fault plane of 304°/28°/48°. The average source duration and the rupture length were ~5.2s and ~19.4km, respectively. The optimal rupture direction, measured counterclockwise from the strike on the fault plane, was 347°, which was projected onto the surface to correspond to the northwestward rupture, consistent with the aftershock distribution. The analysis also suggested a high rupture velocity during faulting, probably approximate to the crustal S-wave velocity, which may have resulted in a low static stress drop and caused the differences in PGA distribution along the direction of earthquake rupture. The dip angles of the fault plane estimated from the initial and centroid depths showed the initial rupture at a lower dip-angle plane and the later rupture at a higher dip-angle one. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Department of Geology, Chinese Culture University, No. 55, Hwa-Kang Rd., Yang-Ming-Shan, Taipei 111, Taiwan; Seismology Center, Central Weather Bureau, Taipei 100, Taiwan; Institute of Geophysics, National Central University, Chung-Li 320, Taiwan; Department of Natural Sciences, National Science Council, Taipei 106, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,5,1.0,1.0,"Hwang, R.-D.; Department of Geology, No. 55, Hwa-Kang Rd., Yang-Ming-Shan, Taipei 111, Taiwan; 電子郵件: hrd@faculty.pccu.edu.tw",,"The authors would like to express their gratitude to the IRIS for providing us with the GSN data, and thank the CWB (Central Weather Bureau, Taiwan) for the use of the earthquake catalog.

2012.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Significant contribution of the shallow crust to seismic PKP traveltime residuals and implications An example from Taiwan and nearby islands,Huang B;Chen P;Hao K;Kim K;Teng T,"Array observations indicate that the relative PKP travel-time residuals in the Taiwan region vary from -2.5 to +2.0 s, a range greater than the largest known teleseismic travel-time residuals from deep Earth. PKP waves are generally employed to probe structures of the deep Earth; however, the contribution of shallow geological structures to PKP waves is generally undefined and the implications of such a contribution have rarely been discussed. Current travel-time tomographic models of Taiwan are able to predict less than 40% of the observed PKP residuals, and the PKP residuals are consistent with the pattern of station corrections used in determining local earthquakes. Detailed island-wide gravity measurements indicate that the distribution of Bouguer anomalies, which were previously proposed to be induced by thick sedimentary deposits in large tectonic basins, is consistent with the pattern of PKP travel-time residuals. In conclusion, the observed PKP residuals are strongly affected by shallow sediments. Therefore, the contribution of residuals from shallow crustal structures should be carefully considered when employing PKP observations for imaging structures of the deep Earth or the deep crust and upper mantle.

Ground motion data are collected by a portable broadband seismic network in northern Vietnam as a part of cooperation between the Institute of Geophysics, Vietnamese Academy of Science and Technology, Vietnam and Institute of Earth Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taiwan. The database comprises a total of 330 amplitude records by 14 broadband stations from 53 shallow earthquakes, which were occurred in and around northern Vietnam in the period between 01/2006 and 12/2009. These earthquakes are of local magnitudes between 1.6 and 4.6, focal depths less than 30 km, and epicentral distances less than 500 km. The new attenuation relationships for PGA and PGV are: log(10)(PGA) = -0.987 + 0.7521M(L) log(10)(R) - 0.00475R, log(10()PGV) = -3.244 + 0.9008M(L) log(10)(R) - 0.00322R, where PGA is in cm/s(2). PGV is in cm/s, and R is the epicentral distance in kilometers. The site corrections are also derived in this study. These site corrections are very suitable with the station corrections for M-L and imply the qualification of the resulting attenuation relationships. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

2012.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,The seismic velocity and attenuation structure beneath the Tatun volcanic area Taiwan,Wen S;Chang Y;Chen C;Chen Y;Teng T,"We have investigated the structure beneath the Tatun volcanic zone north of Taipei metropolitan area of Taiwan, area of five million people. We used the data collected from a seismic network deployed for 5 years over the volcanic zone. This plus another data from Taiwan regional networks allow us to carry out tomographic inversions for V-p, V-p/V-s and Q(p) structures beneath the Tatun volcanic zone. Based on our results and other geological, tectonic, and seismic findings, we reconstruct the structural evolution of the crust in the Tatun volcanic zone, and discuss the implication to the surrounding faults, fractured zones, and discuss potential future volcanic activities. From the tomographic results, there appear to exist a tube-shaped, highly fractured ancient magma passage with high seismic velocities that parallel to the Chinshan fault, and magma passage extends to the southeast at the depth about 20 km. This structure suggests plutonic intrusion passage beneath the Tatun volcano group that may have been associated with the earlier subduction of the Philippine Sea plate, melting of the subducted plate at depth has generated the magma intrusion that has brought about the Tatun volcanic activities. The high seismicity today also implies a highly fractured crust due to the hydrothermal activities and induced crustal stress. The hydrothermal fluid-rich upper crust as indicated by the low V-p/V-s ratio may have important bearing on the potential hazards associated with the two active faults cutting through both the Taipei Basin as well as the Tatun volcanic groups.

2012.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Various links between landslide debris and sediment flux during earthquake and rainstorm events,Lin G;Chen H;Shih T;Lin S,"The variation of riverine dissolved ions is an important clue to understand the connection between earthquake and rainstorm-triggered landslide to the transference of sediment flux. The 2006 M-L 6.2 Taitung earthquake increased the annual sediment discharge of 27 Mt in 2006; more than 2-fold the annual average 12 Mt/yr of the preceding decade in the Luye catchment of southeastern Taiwan. During the same period of time, the proportion of area disturbed by landslides to total catchment area increased from 1.3% before to 2.3% after the earthquake. There was huge amount of vegetable delivered with the transport of landslide debris into channel to increase the concentrations of particulate organic 'carbon in water. However, those sediment flux produced from landslides in wet seasons usually included more particulate silicate material to dilute the occupied ratio of particulate carbon in sediment, which was lower in wet seasons but increased 4-fold in dry seasons. Besides, even through the variations of dissolved ions were relatively stable whether in wet or dry seasons because huge amount of fine material could be provided for whole year, we also found the concentrations of Na+, K+ and Mg+ had significantly increased during the rainstorms following the 2006 Taitung earthquake. This increase should still be attributed to the delivery of landslide debris into the channel, which had a positive impact on the sediment flux after earthquake and subsequent typhoon events.

2013.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,A preliminary seismic study of Taal Volcano Luzon Island Philippines,You S;Gung Y;Lin C;Konstantinou K;Chang T;Chang E;Solidum R,"The very active Taal Volcano lies in the southern part of Luzon Island only 60 km from Manila, the capital of the Philippines. In March 2008 we deployed a temporary seismic network around Taal that consisted of 8 three-component short period seismometers. This network recorded during the period from March to November 2008 about 1050 local events. In the early data processing stages, unexpected linear drifting of clock time was clearly identified for a number of stations. The drifting rates of each problematic station were determined and the errors were corrected before further processing. Initial location of each event was derived by manually picked P-/S-phases arrival times using HYPO71 and a general velocity model based on AK135. Since the velocity structure beneath Taal is essentially unknown, we used travel times of 338 well-located events in order to derive a minimum 1D velocity model using VELEST. The resulting locations show that most events occurred at the shallow depth beneath the Taal Volcano, and two major earthquake groups were noticed, with one lying underneath the western shore of Taal lake and the other one spread around the eastern flank of the Taal Volcano. Since there is no reported volcano activities during the operation period of out seismic array, we are still not confident to interpret these findings in terms of other natures of volcano at the current stage. However, our work represents an important pioneer step towards other more advanced seismic studies in Taal Volcano. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

To assess the dose-response relationship and identify hot spots, we analyzed the national death registry data of Taiwan from 1971 to 2000. We adopted data on 311 townships gathered by a nationwide survey of drinking water and divided arsenic levels into three groups: below 0.05 mg/L, 0.05-0.35 mg/L, and above 0.35 mg/L. Using the direct standardization method to adjust for the effects of age, we calculated the standardized mortality rates of lung cancer in both genders and evaluated their associations with arsenic levels. We also used the geographical information system to identify the hot spots. During the 30-year study period, we identified 64,954 male and 27,039 female lung cancer deaths in the study townships. We found significant increases in lung cancer mortality associated with arsenic levels above 0.35 mg/L in both genders, but the increases associated with levels between 0.05 and 0.35 mg/L were statistically significant in men only. Using both 0.05 and 0.35 mg/L as the cut-offs, we found most of the hot spots were in the southwestern coast and northeastern areas, but the southwestern coast area had some hot spots where the percentages of high risk population were higher than any hot spots in the northeastern area.

2013.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Arsenic in the watersoilplant system and the potential health risks in the coastal part of Chianan Plain Southwestern Taiwan,Kar S;Das S;Jean J;Chakraborty S;Liu C,"The present study investigates the bioavailability, soil to plant transfer and health risks of arsenic (As) in the coastal part of Chianan Plain in southwestern Taiwan. Groundwater used for irrigation, surface soils from agricultural lands and locally grown foodstuffs were collected from eight locations and analyzed for As to assess the risks associated with consuming these items. The concentration of As in groundwater ranged from 13.8 to 881 mu g/L, whereas surface soil showed total As content in the range of 7.92-12.7 mg/kg. The available As content in surface soil accounted for 0.06-6.71% of the total As content, and was significantly correlated with it (R-2 = 0.65, p < 0.05). Among the leachable fraction, the organic matter (3.23-54.8%) and exchangeable portions of oxides (6.03-38.4%) appear to be the major binding phases of As. The average As content in fourteen studied crops and vegetables varied from 10.3 to 151 mu g/kg with maximum in mustard and minimum in radish. All the plants showed considerably higher As content (21.5 +/- 3.64-262 +/- 36.2 mu g/kg) in their roots compared to the edible parts (9.15 +/- 1.44-75.8 22.9 mu g/kg). The bioaccumulation factor (BAF) based on total As (ranging from 0.0009 to 0.144) and available As in soil (ranging from 0.039 to 0.571) indicate that mustard, rice, amaranth and spinach are the highest accumulators of As. Although the health risk index (HRI) of the studied crops and vegetables ranged from only 0.0068-0.454, with the maximum in rice, the combined HRI indicates an alarming value of 0.88.

Asian Earth Sci.,Decreasing intensity of the last glacial stadials in low latitude terrestrial East Asia inferred by a new observation of pollen records in central Taiwan,Liew P;Chen B;Hsieh M;Huang S;Lee C,"The cold intensity of the last glacial stadials corresponding to marine isotope stage (MIS) 5d (or 5b), MIS 4 and MIS 2 in terrestrial East Asia monsoon area is not discussed much due to the paucity of long continuous pollen records. A palynological study of drilling cores from three closely-linked intramontane basins (Toushe, Sun-moon Lake and Yuchi) in central Taiwan provides a history of shifting altitudinal vegetation zones in surrounding mountains during late Quaternary climate changes. By integrating these records, we found that the alpine conifer forest approached its lowest altitude, about 614 m, during the earliest stadial (=MIS 5d or 5b), and 745 m during the early stadial (=MIS 4) based on records of Yuchi Basin and Sun-moon Lake. In addition, the pollen records of Toushe Basin and Sun-moon Lake show more temperate conditions for the late stadial (=MIS 2) than the early stadial (MIS 4). This leads to an interpretation of a decreasing intensity of stadials during the last glaciation, which might follow the regional insolation amplitude. Such a decreasing trend in coldness during the last glacial stadials does not exist in the record for the South China Sea which reflects a different sensitivity and response to climatic forcings between terrestrial and marine.

2013.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Earthquakeinduced crustal gravitational potential energy change in the Philippine area,Lin J;Lo C,"The crustal gravitational potential energy change (Delta GPE) caused by earthquakes in the Philippine area from January 1976 to November 2011 was estimated in this study. The active convergence between the Philippine Sea Plate and the Sundaland-Eurasian margin is reflected by the greatest gains in GPE along the Philippine, Negros and Cotabato trenches, whereas the Manila Trench is covered by a GPE loss pattern. Although the Philippine Mobile Belt (PMB) itself is actually affected by the ongoing collision and subduction processes, almost the entire Philippine Fault Zone is dominated by GPE loss, revealing a slightly extensional environment along the fault. The time evolution of the cumulated Delta GPE for different segments along the Philippine archipelago shows distinct patterns. Due to the numerous large under-thrusting events that have occurred along the Philippine Trench, the cumulated Delta GPE is regularly increasing in its most southern segment. However, in the middle segments, where the Palawan Block enters into collision with the PMB, the increase in cumulated Delta GPE is relatively small. In the most northern segment, where the North Luzon is located, a decrease of cumulated Delta GPE demonstrates that the seismic characteristic of the Manila Trench is dissimilar from other subduction systems in the world. We suggest that the collision of both the Palawan Block and the Benham Rise with the PMB promotes the rotation of the PMB and facilitates the northward escape of the northeastern Luzon, resulting in a decrease of cumulated Delta GPE in the northern Philippines.

Here we report for the first time an enriched mantle component that is additionally recorded in this crustal section. New whole rock major and trace element data are presented for nine mafic volcanic rocks from a section of the ophiolite that has not been previously examined. These moderately evolved tholeiitic basalts were found to have resulted from the bulk mixing of 10% ocean island basalt components with depleted mantle. Drawing together various geochemical characteristics reported for different rock suites taken as representatives of the South China Sea crust, including the enriched MORB (EMORB) and NMORB of the East Taiwan Ophiolite, the NMORB from previous studies of the Amnay Ophiolite and the younger ocean floor eruptives of the Scarborough Seamount-Reed Bank region, a veined mantle model is proposed for the South China Sea mantle.

2013.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Evaluating color reflectance spectral methods for estimating biogenic contents of South China Sea sediments,Pan H;Chen M,"The biogenic contents of marine sediment cores are useful proxies for revealing past oceanic and climatic variability. Color reflectance spectral methods provide a rapid and non-destructive avenue for acquiring high-resolution biogenic content data from the split surfaces of marine sediment cores. This study presents new results on the applications of color reflectance methods for determining the biogenic contents of sediment cores retrieved from the South China Sea (SCS), a dynamic setting that receives biogenic components such as carbonate, total organic carbon (TOC), and opal from the sea, and terrestrial sediments transported by the Pearl River and Kao-Ping River from the north, and the Sunda Shelf from the south. Our study found that the color reflectance methods that are based on a regionally limited calibration provide more optimal estimates of the biogenic content of marine cores from the SCS than do basin-scale calibration methods. Though the regional calibrations appear to be successful, our analyses indicate the complexity of applying color reflectance methods in marine sediment core studies. We also performed a controlled experiment that was designed to quantitatively test how the carbonate content increased the influence of color reflectance changes, using outcropped, Pleistocene-aged sediment samples taken from the ""Moon World (MW)"" in southwestern Taiwan as control data. The results of this experiment suggest that the regression equations for estimating CaCO3 content based on core data are not solely driven by input variables responding directly to CaCO3 content changes, and that the composition of terrestrial sediment inputs into the SCS are complicated both spatially and temporally. Our studies also suggest that a better understanding of the compositional changes of terrestrial sediment inputs into the SCS will be required to minimize the uncertainties of biogenic content estimations by color reflectance methods.

2013.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Evaluation of environmental fate and sinks of PCDDFs during specific extreme weather events in Taiwan,Chi K;Lin C;Ou Y C;Hsu S;Chen Y;Luo S;Kao S,"Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) are persistent organic pollutants (POPs) that are formed and released unintentionally from anthropogenic sources. The high persistence of PCDD/Fs results in the concentrations of these contaminants in environment decreasing only very slowly. Two transport pathways, air and water, carry PCDD/Fs into all regions of the world. Recently, more frequent extreme weather events, such as storms and floods, have been projected to occur as a result of global warming. Extreme weather events have a documented impact on the remobilization and subsequent bioavailability of POPs. In this study, three specific episodes, namely winter monsoon, southeast biomass burning and tropical cyclone (typhoon) events, which influence the environmental fate and transport of PCDD/Fs in Taiwan, were evaluated based on a climate change scenario. During the winter (northeast) monsoon period, the temperature and relative humidity observed in northern Taiwan decreases sharply. During this time, the quantity of PCDD/Fs adsorbed onto suspended particles, as observed at background sites, was found to increase from 300+/-127 to 630+/-115 pg I-TEQg-TSP-1, which is even higher than that measured in Taipei City (438+/-80 pg I-TEQg-TSP-1). Hence, the winter monsoon not only brings cold air but also transports air pollutants and dust over long distances from mainland China to Taiwan. During the 2010 Southeast Asia biomass burning events (2010/3/22-3/28), the level of atmospheric PCDD/Fs were measured in central Taiwan (Mt. Lulin) and in the source region of northern Thailand (Chiang Mai): this revealed that the variations in atmospheric PCDD/F concentrations at these two sites followed a similar pattern. On 25 March 2010, the atmospheric PCDD/F concentration increased dramatically from 1.43 to 6.09 fg I-TEQ m(-3) at Mt Lulin and from 7.64 to 12.1 fg I-TEQ m(-3) in northern Thailand. However, the atmospheric PCDD/F concentration decreased dramatically 1 day after the biomass burning event Based on the measurements from a dated sediment core collected at a reservoir in northern Taiwan, the sharp increases in input fluxes of PCDD/Fs and mineral-derived elements levels in 1990 (20 ng I-TEQ m(-2) year(-1)), 2001 (17 ng I-TEQ m(-2) year(-1)), 2004 (16 ng I-TEQ m(-2) year(-1)) and 2005 (15 ng I-TEQ m(-2) year(-1)) seem to be a result of a deep turbid layer formed upstream due to landslides and/or mud flows during the typhoon season. This finding demonstrates the effect of typhoon events on the long-term remobilization of PCDD/Fs as well as supporting the hypothesis that such events would have the potential to remobilize pollutants that have been deposited previously.

The performed statistics indicate that the day-time measurements present higher disorder and lower organization than the night-time measurements. Such difference is more evident for the high-frequency band of resistivity data, which suggests that possibly some source of the electromagnetic field could be of anthropic origin. Furthermore, we also note the characteristics of so-called MT dead-band with the periodicity of similar to 10 s could be revealed in the high values of Shannon entropy power. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

2013.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Inverting ground motion from a seismometer array to obtain the vertical component of rotation A test using data from explosions,Chi W;Lee W;Lin C;Liu C,"To study factors that affect reliability of the derived vertical rotational ground motions (about vertical axis) from translational array waveforms, we have conducted a field test using explosion. The dataset was collected on March 4, 2008 from an active source experiment of the Taiwan Geodynamics Research project (TAIGER, 2008), in which 750 kg of explosives were set off about 500 m away from a specially designed seismic array in free field consisting of 8 tri-axial rotational sensors, 13 tri-axial accelerometers, and 12 six-channel, 24-bit dataloggers with GPS receivers. Our results show that the waveform fits were greatly improved when the explosion-induced crustal strains were less than 2 x 10(-5) for our station configuration. As a result, our modeling for the large amplitude part of the mainshock was not entirely successful. However, we have successfully recovered the first order features of the later part of the vertical rotational ground motions using translational velocity waveforms in the 0.5-20 Hz bandwidth using the Spudich and Fletcher's procedure (2009). Moreover, we used a modified Jaeger's (1,969) formula and derived similar rotational synthetics. We found that the best rotational rate waveform fits were derived using a station configuration of a dense, small-aperture, translational array combined with a few large-offset stations. A small-aperture array is needed to fulfill the uniform rotation assumption. However, inverting data from an array of small spatial dimension requires waveforms of high signal to noise ratio and high sampling rates. Surprisingly, large-offset translation stations provided additional constraints in time and space, helping to fit the low frequency waveforms. Using the inverted result, we forward predicted the vertical translational waveforms not used in the inversion and got excellent fits. This suggests that the inverted results are of good quality for predicting the complete translational ground motions, even though only horizontal components were used in the inversion. Array-derived or directly measured rotational ground motions can be used to predict translational ground motions in the near-by region. Lessons learned from this study could be helpful for future studies using translational ground motions to derive dynamic ground strains, tilts, and torsions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We recruited 8086 residents in 1991-1994 and monitored them for their newly developed types of cancers, identified by computerized linkage with the national cancer registry profile. There were 37 newly diagnosed urothelial carcinoma cases and 223 new lung cancer cases during the follow-up period (until 2007). The lifetime (3585 years old) cumulative risk of developing urothelial carcinoma from an arsenic concentration in the drinking water of <10, 10-99, and 100+ mu g/L was 0.29%, 1.07% and 3.43%, respectively. The corresponding probabilities were 7.42%, 8.99% and 17.09% for the lifetime risk of developing lung cancer. Cigarette smoking was associated with an increased risk of urothelial carcinoma and lung cancer, showing the hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) of 2.48 (1.27-4.82) and 3.44 (2.00-5.90) after adjusting for the arsenic concentration in drinking water. After adjusting for cigarette smoking, the hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) of developing urothelial carcinoma caused by the arsenic concentration in drinking water of <10, 10-99 and 100+ mu g/L was 1.0 (the reference group), 2.18 (0.59-8.01), and 8.71 (2.49-30.48), respectively. The corresponding figures were 1.0 (the reference group), 1.14 (0.80-1.61), 1.84 (1.28-2.65) for lung cancer. Synergistic effects on the development of urothelial carcinoma and lung cancer existed between the arsenic exposure level and cigarette smoking. It is suggested that people who have had a high exposure to arsenic in drinking water should stop smoking cigarettes to lower their lifetime risk of urothelial carcinoma and lung cancer.

2013.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Maximum magnitudes in aftershock sequences in Taiwan,Chan C;Wu Y,"In this work, Bath's Law, the b-value in Gutenberg-Richter Law (G-R Law) in the form of the 1/beta relationship, and both the a- and b-values in the G-R Law were introduced in order to estimate maximum aftershock magnitudes of earthquake sequences in the Taiwan region. The averaged difference of magnitude between the mainshock and the maximum aftershock is 1.20, and is consistent with Bath's Law, however, with a large uncertainty. The large uncertainty implies that the difference may result from a variable controlled by other factors, such as the aftershocks number of an earthquake sequence and magnitude threshold for mainshock. With 1/beta, since 86% of the earthquake sequences with a M >= 6.0 mainshock follow this relationship, the upper bound of the maximum magnitude can be estimated for an earthquake sequence with a large mainshock. The a- and b-values in the G-R Law was also considered by evaluating maximum aftershock magnitudes. As there are low residuals between the model and the observations, the results suggest that the G-R Law is a good index for maximum aftershock magnitude determinations. In order to evaluate the temporal decays of maximum aftershock magnitudes, modified Omori's Law was introduced. Using the approaches mentioned above, the maximum magnitudes and the temporal evolution of an earthquake sequence could be modeled. Among them, the model of the G-R Law has the best fit with observations for most of earthquake sequences. It shows its feasibility. The results of this work may benefit seismic hazards mitigation in the form of rapid re-evaluations for short-term seismic hazards immediately following devastating earthquake.

2013.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Methane flux from miniseepage in mud volcanoes of SW Taiwan Comparison with the data from Italy Romania and Azerbaijan,Hong W;Etiope G;Yang T;Chang P,"Mud volcanoes (MVs) are considered important methane (CH4) sources for the atmosphere; gas is not only released from macro-seepage, i.e., from craters and visible gas bubbling manifestations, but also from invisible and pervasive exhalation from the ground, named miniseepage. CH4 flux related to miniseepage was measured only in a few MVs, in Azerbaijan, Italy, Japan, Romania and Taiwan. This study examines in detail the flux data acquired in 5 MVs and 1 ""dry"" seep in SW Taiwan, and further compares with other 23 MVs in Italy, Romania and Azerbaijan. Miniseepage from the six manifestations in SW Taiwan MVs and seeps annually contribute at least 110 tons of methane directly to the atmosphere, and represents about similar to 80% of total degassing during a quiescent period. Combining miniseepage flux and geo-electrical data from the Wu-shan-ding MV revealed a possible link between gas flux and electrical resistivity of the vadose zone. This suggests that unsaturated subsoil is a preferential zone for shallow gas accumulation and seepage to the atmosphere. Besides, miniseepage flux in Chu-huo everlasting fire decreases by increasing the distance from the main gas channeling zone and molecular fractionation (methane/ethane ratio) is higher for lower flux seepage, consistently with what observed in other MVs worldwide. Measurements from Azerbaijan, Italy, Romania, and Taiwan converge to indicate that miniseepage is directly proportional to the vent output and it is a significant component of the total methane budget of a MV. A miniseepage vs. macro-seepage flux equation has been statistically assessed and it can be used to estimate theoretically at least the order of magnitude of the flux of miniseepage for MVs of which only the flux from vents was evaluated, or will be evaluated in future. This will allow a more complete and objective quantification of gas emission in MVs, thus also refining the estimate of the global methane emission from geological sources. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

2013.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Observation of surface displacements from GPS analyses before and after the Jiashian earthquake M64 in Taiwan,Chen C;Wen S;Yeh T;Wang C;Yen H;Liu J;Hobara Y;Han P,"A blind thrust fault with a unique strike, which is orthogonal to the strike of most tectonic structures in Taiwan, triggered the Jiashian earthquake on March 4, 2010 (M = 6.4; 22.96 degrees N, 120.70 degrees E). This study utilizes 100 global positioning system stations to examine changes of surface displacements during the Jiashian earthquake. We mitigate effects of short-term noise and long-term plate movements from surface displacement data using a frequency dependent filter via the Hilbert-Huang transform and compute the horizontal azimuth (i.e. GPS-azimuth) using residual data at the NS component relative to residual data at the EW component Analytical results show that orientations of horizontal azimuths were aligned and orthogonal to the strike of the blind thrust fault. Meanwhile, inverse orientations are observed before and after the earthquake that agrees well with the seismic rebound theory. As stress disturbed on strata a few days before the earthquake, an impeded region can be clearly identified by disordered orientations of horizontal azimuths for anticipating the mainshock. These results provide an additional view to explore stress disturbance associated with earthquakes and offer more information to examine diverse models of tectonic evolution in this region.

From these samples, 17 selected samples with large delta C-13(TOC) fluctuations were analyzed for n-alkane and delta D of the C27 and C29 n-alkanes. Combining with the detailed high-resolution pollen and geochemical records, this study reveals more detailed climatic variations in terms of temperature and precipitation as well as abrupt climatic events during the past 30 Kyrs. Before the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), climate was cold and damp with predominantly woodland vegetation in Toushe Basin, and turned to cold and dry after 25 Kyr BP. Climatic conditions there were the worst during LGM over the past 30 Kyrs, especially around 23 and 18 Kyr BP when the woodland was diminished and C4 grass was dominated. Although short durations of relatively wet conditions could be found at 17, 16 and 14 Kyr BP, cold and dry climates were prevailing during 29.5-28, 24-22, 17-15 and 13-11.5 Kyr BP, corresponding to Heinrich (H) Events 3, 2, 1, and Younger Dryas (YD), respectively. During the early Holocene, dry climate occurred at similar to 11, similar to 10, 9.7-9.2 and similar to 8 Kyr BP; whereas wet condition appeared at 10.3, 9.8, 9-7.5 Kyr BP. In the middle Holocene, climate kept warm and moderate wet in the first half period, but many dry events existed in the second half following a cold and dry event at 6 Kyr BP. After a sharply warm peak at 5.2 Kyr BP, the climate in Toushe turned to cold quickly, and tree/shrub vegetation disappeared completely with the replacement of C3 grasses. In the late Holocene, climate was relatively wetter with predominant C3 grasses in the basin. Our climatic interpretations based on the peat records agree well with the Greenland ice core and Chinese speleothem records on millennium time scales during the last glacial period. Dry climates corresponding to weakening of the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) during the Heinrich events and Younger Dryas in central Taiwan and eastern China demonstrate the climatic forcing on such long time scales in concert with regional monsoon climate. However, the discrepancies exist between our peat record and the Dongge/Hulu stalagmite record on: (1) the age of H2; (2) climate intensities of LGM and HI; and (3) wetness condition during Holocene. These observations call for further study on high-resolution climatic changes especially on moisture budget in the East Asian monsoonal region. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Comparison with a published high-SST and high-salinity equatorial tropical Pacific record, MD98-2181 located at the Mindanao Current (MC) at 6.3 degrees N, reveals an anomalous time interval at 3.5-1.5 kyr ago (before 1950 AD).

2013.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Plate tearing in the northwestern corner of the subducting Philippine Sea Plate,Lin J;Hsu S;Sibuet J;Lee C;Liang C,"The Philippine Sea Plate (PHS) simultaneously subducts northwestward and collides eastward with the Eurasian Plate (EU) in northeast Taiwan. These two tectonic events induce high seismic activity, which makes northeastern Taiwan one of the most seismically active zones in the world. To understand the mechanical processes at work, we used existing geophysical data and the aftershocks recorded following a recent large strike-slip event occurring within the PHS oceanic crust. During this event, a NW-SE trending left-lateral sub-parallel to the PHS/EU convergence vector was active. As a consequence of the collision/subduction plate geometry, we show that the lithosphere of the northwestern corner of the PHS has been torn in a NW-SE orientation. This tectonic feature is associated with an abrupt tectonic stress boundary and could generate large intra-plate earthquakes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

2013.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Presentday crustal deformation along the Philippine Fault in Luzon Philippines,Yu S;Hsu Y;Bacolcol T;Yang C;Tsai Y;Solidum R,"The Philippine Fault results from the oblique convergence between the Philippine Sea Plate and the Sunda Block/Eurasian Plate. The fault exhibits left-lateral slip and transects the Philippine archipelago from the northwest corner of Luzon to the southeast end of Mindanao for about 1200 km. To better understand fault slip behavior along the Philippine Fault, eight GPS surveys were conducted from 1996 to 2008 in the Luzon region. We combine the 12-yr survey-mode GPS data in the Luzon region and continuous GPS data in Taiwan, along with additional 15 International GNSS Service sites in the Asia-Pacific region, and use the GAMIT/GLOBK software to calculate site coordinates. We then estimate the site velocity from position time series by linear regression. Our results show that the horizontal velocities with respect to the Sunda Block gradually decrease from north to south along the western Luzon at rates of 85-49 mm/yr in the west-northwest direction. This feature also implies a southward decrease of convergence rate along the Manila Trench. Significant internal deformation is observed near the Philippine Fault. Using a two dimensional elastic dislocation model and GPS velocities, we invert for fault geometries and back-slip rates of the Philippine Fault. The results indicate that the back-slip rates on the Philippine Fault increase from north to south, with the rates of 22,37 and 40 mm/yr, respectively, on the northern, central, and southern segments. The inferred long-term fault slip rates of 24-40 mm/yr are very close to back-slip rates on locked fault segments, suggesting the Philippine Fault is fully locked. The stress tensor inversions from earthquake focal mechanisms indicate a transpressional regime in the Luzon area. Directions of sigma(1) axes and maximum horizontal compressive axes are between 90 degrees and 110 degrees, consistent with major tectonic features in the Philippines. The high angle between sigma(1) axes and the Philippine Fault in central Luzon suggests a weak fault zone possibly associated with fluid pressure. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

2013.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Rare earth elements in finegrained sediments of major rivers from the highstanding island of Taiwan,Li C;Shi X;Kao S;Liu Y;Lyu H;Zou J;Liu S;Qiao S,"Thirty-eight sediment samples from 15 primary rivers on Taiwan were retrieved to characterize the rare earth element (REE) signature of fluvial fine sediment sources. Compared to the three large rivers on the Chinese mainland, distinct differences were observed in the REE contents, upper continental crust normalized patterns and fractionation factors of the sediment samples. The average REE concentrations of the Taiwanese river sediments are higher than those of the Changjiang and Huanghe, but lower than the Zhujiang. Light rare earth elements (LREEs) are enriched relative to heavy rare earth elements (HREEs) with ratios from 7.48 to 13.03. We found that the variations in (La/Lu)(UCC)-(Gd/Lu)(UCC) and (La/Yb)(UCC)-(Gd/Yb)(UCC) are good proxies for tracing the source sediments of Taiwanese and Chinese rivers due to their distinguishable values. Our analyses indicate that the REE compositions of Taiwanese river sediments were primarily determined by the properties of the bedrock, and the intensity of chemical weathering in the drainage areas. The relatively high relief and heavy rainfall also have caused the REEs in the fluvial sediments from Taiwan to be transported to the estuaries down rivers from the mountains, and in turn delivered nearly coincidently to the adjacent seas by currents and waves. Our studies suggest that the REE patterns of the river sediments from Taiwan are distinguishable from those from the other sources of sediments transported into the adjacent seas, and therefore are useful proxies for tracing the provenances and dispersal patterns of sediments, as well as paleoenvironmental changes in the marginal seas.

2013.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Recognition of large scale deepseated landslides in forest areas of Taiwan using high resolution topography,Lin C;Tseng C;Tseng Y;Fei L;Hsieh Y;Tarolli P,"Large deep-seated landslides can be reactivated during intense events, and they can evolve into destructive failures. They are generally difficult to recognize in the field, especially when they develop in densely forested areas. A detailed and constantly updated inventory map of such phenomena, and the recognition of their topographic signatures is absolutely a key tool for landslide risk mitigation. The aim of this work is to test in forested areas, the performance of the new automatic and objective methodology developed by Tarolli et al. (2012) for geomorphic features extraction (landslide crowns) from high resolution topography (LiDAR derived Digital Terrain Models - DTMs). The methodology is based on the detection of landslides through the use of thresholds obtained by the statistical analysis of variability of landform curvature. The study was conducted in a high-risk area located in the central-south Taiwan, where an accurate field survey on landsliding processes and a high-quality set of airborne laser scanner elevation data are available. The area has been chosen because some of the deep-seated landslides are located near human infrastructures and their reactivation is highly dangerous. Thanks to LiDAR's capability to detect the bare ground elevation data in forested areas, it was possible to recognize in detail landslide features also in remote regions difficult to access. The results, if compared with the previous work of Tarolli et al. (2012), mainly focused on shallow landslides, and in a not forested area, indicate that for deep-seated landslides, where the crowns are more evident, and they are present at large scale, the tested methodology performs better (higher quality index). The method can be used to interactively assist the interpreter/user on the task of deep-seated landslide hazard mapping, and risk assessment planning of such regions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

2013.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Rupture behavior of a moderate earthquake MW 59 April 2006 and its close relation with the 2003 Chengkung earthquake MW 68 at the southern termination of the plate boundary southeast Taiwan,Mozziconacci L;Huang B;Delouis B;Lee J;Lee S,"The Taiwanese orogen is the result of the active and vigorous collision between the Eurasian and the Philippine Sea plates. In this strong convergence context, a one month-long earthquake sequence composed of two mainshocks of magnitude 6 occurred in April 2006 in the Taitung area. The first main-shock (T1) mobilized a structure just west to the plate boundary, while the second one (T2) is located on the other side. In order to retrieve the exact fault geometry of T2, we inverted waveforms from stations located at local and teleseismic distances. We performed a grid search on strike and dip (each strike-dip couple defining a geometry) considering the source as a point source then as an extended source. In the last case, a simple average over stations misfit failed to isolate a precise geometry. To overcome this problem, we used a more statistical approach on the distribution of misfits to define the best geometry. Comparing the best model to local structures, it appears the generative fault was the plate boundary that rotates from a strike pointing at N20 degrees E north of the event to N0 degrees E in T2 area with an identical eastward dip of 35 degrees. For this model, the fault slip inversion provides a critical slip of 3.5 cm above which slip, rake and rupture time are constrained with uncertainties of 29%, 14 degrees and 0.47 s respectively. The average slip along the rupture was 20 cm with a maximum of 46 +/- 13 cm. The movement was inverse with a minor left-lateral component similar to the faulting behavior of the plate boundary. In addition, the slip pattern of T2 is contained within the southern portion of the deepest segment of the plate boundary and at the edge of the rupture area of the 2003 Chengkung earthquake (M-w 6.8), a large event also generated by the plate boundary but 2.5 years earlier. After 1 s of aseismic spreading, the rupture propagated seismically and circularly outward before being stopped by the fault bending. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

2013.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Sediment dispersal and accumulation in tectonic accommodation across the Gaoping Slope offshore Southwestern Taiwan,Hsu H;Liu C;Yu H;Chang J;Chen S,"Distribution and architecture of slope basins across a continental slope vary as a consequence of accommodation forming, sediment dispersal rates, canyon cutting, sediment filling and different sediment transporting mechanisms. The area offshore Southwestern Taiwan is generally recognized as having active tectonics and high sediment deposition rates. In the Gaoping Slope, slope basins are formed by the developments of folds, faults and diapiric intrusions. Portions of the sediments discharged from the Taiwan mountain belt have been trapped in these basins in the Gaoping Shelf and Gaoping Slope. The rest of the sediments were transported to deep sea areas through submarine canyons. This complex system of folds, faults, diapirs, slope basins, submarine canyons, and sediment deposits has also readjusted the morphology of the Gaoping Slope. This study examines the linkage between accommodation spaces of tectonic and sedimentary processes in the Gaoping Slope through seismic facies analysis. Four seismic facies which include convergent-symmetrical facies, convergent-baselapping facies, chaotic facies, and parallel and drape facies, and different deposition patterns have been recognized in the Gaoping Slope basins. The thick mud layers which are regarded as the source of diapiric intrusions are first observed beneath the basin. Strata records show that the accommodation spaces in various slope basins have increased or decreased during different stages of basin evolution. Because of the competition between regional tectonism (accommodation space variations) and sediment routing distance from provenance to depository (sediment input variations), most under-filled basins lie in the lower slope domain in the Gaoping Slope, but also in the upper slope domain east of the Gaoping Submarine Canyon. This observation suggests that in the inner Gaoping Slope west of the Gaoping Submarine Canyon, sediment deposition rate is higher than the basin subsidence rate, the topography of the upper slope domain there is ""healed"", and most sediments are overfilled in the slope basins now. Besides the sequential steps of sedimentary disposal in the filling-and-spilling model, we have also observed evidences which indicate that mass movements and submarine canyons in the area have significantly changed the sediment dispersal patterns in the slope basins of the Gaoping Slope. We suggest that although filling-and-spilling is a key sedimentary process in the Gaoping Slope, tectonic activities, mass wasting events and canyon feeding processes have diversified sediment transporting mechanisms from the inner to outer slopes in the area offshore Southwest Taiwan.

2013.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Sediment dispersal system in the TaiwanSouth China Sea collision zone along a convergent margin A comparison with the Papua New Guinea collision zone of the western Solomon Sea,Hsiung K;Yu H,"Through a large-scale examination of the morpho-sedimentary features on sea floors in the Taiwan-Luzon convergent margin, we determined the main sediment dispersal system which stretches from 23 degrees N to 20 degrees N and displays as an aligned linear sediment pathway, consisting of the Penghu Canyon, the deep-sea Penghu Channel and northern Manila Trench. The seafloor of South China Sea north of 21 degrees N are underlain by a triangle-shaped collision marine basin, resulting from oblique collision between the Luzon Arc and Chinese margin, and are mainly occupied by two juxtaposed slopes, the South China Sea and Kaoping Slopes, and a southward tilting basin axis located along the Penghu Canyon. Two major tributary canyons of the Formosa and Kaoping and small channels and gullies on both slopes join into the axial Penghu Canyon and form a dendritic canyon drainage system in this collision marine basin. The canyon drainage system is characteristic of lateral sediment supply from flank slopes and axial sediment transport down-canyon following the tilting basin axis. The significance of the collision marine basin in term of source to sink is that sediments derived from nearby orogen and continental margins are transported to and accumulated in the collision basin, serving as a temporary sediment sink and major marine transport route along the basin axis. The comparison of the Taiwan-South China Sea collision zone with the Papua New Guinea collision zone of the western Solomon Sea reveals remarkable similarities in tectonic settings and sedimentary processes that have resulted in similar sediment dispersal systems consisting of (1) a canyon drainage network mainly in the collision basin and (2) a longitudinal sediment transport system comprising a linear connection of submarine canyon, deep-sea channel and oceanic trench beyond the collision marine basin.

2013.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Sedimentology and foreland basin paleogeography during Taiwan arc continent collision,Nagel S;Castelltort S;Wetzel A;Willett S;Mouthereau F;Lin A,"The Western foreland basin in Taiwan originated through the oblique collision between the Luzon volcanic arc and the Asian passive margin. Crustal flexure adjacent to the growing orogenic load created a subsiding foreland basin. The sedimentary record reveals progressively changing sedimentary environments influenced by the orogen approaching from the East. Based on sedimentary facies distribution at five key stratigraphic horizons, paleogeographic maps were constructed. The maps highlight the complicated basin-wide dynamics of sediment dispersal within an evolving foreland basin. The basin physiography changed very little from the middle Miocene (similar to 12.5 Ma) to the late Pliocene (similar to 3 Ma). The transition from a passive margin to foreland basin setting in the late Pliocene (similar to 3 Ma), during deposition of the mud-dominated Chinshui Shale, is dominantly marked by a deepening and widening of the main depositional basin. These finer grained Taiwan derived sediments clearly indicate increased subsidence, though water depths remain relatively shallow, and sedimentation associated with the approach of the growing orogen to the East. In the late Pleistocene as the shallow marine wedge ahead of the growing orogen propagated southward, the proximal parts of the basin evolved into a wedge-top setting introducing deformation and sedimentation in the distal basin. Despite high Pleistocene to modern erosion/sedimentation rates, shallow marine facies persist, as the basin remains open to the South and longitudinal transport is sufficient to prevent it from becoming overfilled or even fully terrestrial. Our paleoenvironmental and paleogeographical reconstructions constrain southward propagation rates in the range of 5-20 km/Myr from 2 Ma to 0.5 Ma, and 106-120 km/Myr between late Pleistocene and present (0.5-0 Ma). The initial rates are not synchronous with the migration of the sediment depocenters highlighting the complexity of sediment distribution and accumulation in evolving foreland basins.

2013.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Shearwave velocity model of the Chukuo fault zone Southwest Taiwan from cross correlation of seismic ambient noise,Yeh Y;Wen S;Lee K;Chen C,"The Chia-Nan (Chiayi-Tainan) area is in the southwestern Taiwan, and is located at the active deformation front of the collision of the Eurasian continental plate and the Philippine Sea plate, which causes complex folds as well as thrust fault systems in the area. The Chukuo fault zone is a boundary between the Western Foothill and the Western Coastal Plain in the Chia-Nan area. The nature of the crustal structure beneath the fault zone, especially the eastern part of the fault zone with mountain topography, has not been well known in detailed due to lack of drilling data as well as its limitation in using other geophysical methods, such as active source survey. In this study, we deployed an array with 11 broadband seismic stations to monitor the seismicity of the Chukuo fault zone. The array has recorded more than 1000 microearthquakes around this area. It provides an opportunity to use P- and S-wave travel time data to investigate the both the crustal P- and S-velocity in the fault zone, however due to the nature of the earthquake distribution, the ray density is relatively low at depth between 0 and 7 km. In addition, the uncertainty of S-wave reading for small earthquake also a limit in building precise S-velocity profile, Thus, we take the advantages of using cross-correlation of seismic ambient noise to investigate crustal S-velocity profile in the Chukuo fault area, especially in the mountain area where crustal faulting is a dominated phenomenon. The results indicate that S-wave velocity in the uppermost crust in the Chukuo fault zone is shown to be slower than previous studies. A low velocity layer exists at depth between 1 and 2 km in the east of the Chukuo Fault.

2013.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Significance of indigenous Eocene larger foraminifera Discocyclina dispansa in Western Foothills Central Taiwan A Paleogene marine rift basin in Chinese continental margin,Huang C;Yen Y;Liew P;He D;Chi W;Wu M;Zhao M,"The Western Foothills of Taiwan was known to be composed of Late Oligocene to Pleistocene shallow marine strata continuously deposited on the stable passive Chinese continental margin without significant stratigraphic break. Here we present multiple micropaleontological evidences, including occurrence of larger foraminifera Discocyclina dispansa ex. interc. sella-dispansa and calcareous nannoplanktons, to show that there are Middle Eocene marine strata (first named as the Chungliao Formation) exposed in the Tsukeng anticline of the Western Foothills, central Taiwan. Occurrences of intact tests with thin delicate outer rims and well-preserved embryonic chambers suggest that the Discocyclina dispansa ex. interc. sella-dispansa (Lutetian to Bartonian in the Tethys region) are buried indigenously on shallow inner shelf during an episodic transgression in the Early Middle Eocene. The conclusion is consistent with a biostratigraphy study of calcareous nannoplanktons (Zones NP14-15) in the shale/sandstone alternations overlying the Discocyclina-bearing bed of the Chungliao Formation and calcareous nannofossils of Zone NP16 integrated with an age dating of 38.8 +/- 1 Ma (Late Middle Eocene) on zircon grains of the overlying Pinglin Tuff. The Middle Eocene syn-rift sequences (Chungliao Formation and Pinglin Tuff) exposed along the Tsukeng anticline are unconformably covered by the latest Oligocene-Miocene post-rift sequence, a scenario similar to what have been drilled in the East China Sea-Taiwan Strait-South China Sea. This rift basin (named as the Nantou Basin) is sitting on the Peikang Basement High margin which further extends southwestward to the Central Uplift of the Pearl River Mouth Basin in the northern slope of the South China Sea. The present work documents a hitherto unknown occurrence of the exposed early Tertiary marine rift basin sequence in the Western Foothills of Taiwan. The study extends our knowledge of the Western Foothills geohistory from the Late Oligocene downward to the Early Middle Eocene. The occurrence of the Paleogene Nantou rift basin in the Western Foothills may also suggest that there could have similar Paleogene rift sequences exposed in other parts of the Taiwan mountain belt like the Hsuehshan Range and the Central Range east of the Western Foothills.

2013.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Static stress drop inferred from nearfault parameters for the 1999 ChiChi earthquake in Taiwan,Huang W;Huang B;Lee C,"In 2001, a special issue of the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America (BSSA) featured seismological research for the 1999 Chi-Chi Taiwan earthquake. This study uses source parameters suggested by the first author in this special issue to estimate static stress drop associated with the Chi-Chi earthquake. The waveform simulation method was used to carefully examine these source parameters. The simulation results indicate that source parameters, inferred from near-fault observations, are well determined. According to the rupture area and slip, the static stress drops (Delta sigma(s)) obtained were distributed between a small value of 47 bars near the epicentral region and a much larger value (>200 bars) to the north. Similar trends in dynamic stress drop (Delta sigma(d)) were also recognized by the first author in his paper published in 2001 BSSA special issue. Comparing the Delta sigma(s) with Delta sigma(d), satisfies the relation Delta sigma(s)/Delta sigma(d) approximate to 1. This relation suggests that fault motion is mostly spent releasing seismic wave energy during the rupture process of the Chi-Chi earthquake. The consistency between static and dynamic stress drops thus provides a measure of energy-moment (E-s/M-0) ratios, which range from 9.0 x 10(-5) to 6.5 x 10(-4). The average E-s/M-0 ratio estimated for the northern portions of the fault is 3.4 x 10(-4), which is about 3 times that of the south. Such a high E-s/M-0 ratio can be interpreted as having low strength in the rupture for the northern portions of the fault, where the fault would release less energy per unit rupture surface to create the new rupture.

2013.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,The association of diabetes mellitus with subsequent internal cancers in the arsenicexposed area of Taiwan,Hsu L;Wang Y;Chiou H;Wu M;Yang T;Chen Y;Tseng C;Chen C,"Background: Epidemiological studies have shown that diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with an increased risk of cancer. The aim of this study was to examine the association of diabetes with subsequent internal cancers in an arsenic-exposed area where the prevalence of diabetes is remarkably higher than in the general Taiwan population. Methods: The southwestern cohort was recruited from blackfoot disease (BFD) endemic townships with high arsenic levels in their well water, while the northeastern cohort was recruited from four townships in the Lanyang Basin with low-to-moderate arsenic level in their well water. These two cohorts were combined and a total of 9525 subjects were recruited for the analysis. The disease status of the subjects, including diabetes, hypertension or dyslipidemia, was ascertained through linkage with the computerized Taiwan National Health Insurance (NHI) database, while the cancer status of the subjects was ascertained through linkage with National Cancer Registry and via the NHI database for major illness/injury certificates/catastrophic illness cards. The subjects were followed from study entry through December 31, 2009. Cox regression analysis with time-dependent DM status was used to determine the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (Cls) for developing internal malignancies. Results: Diabetic patients had a 58% higher risk of any site internal cancer compared to non-DM individuals (HR, 1.58; 95% CI: 1.39-1.79) after adjusting for age, sex, education level, cigarette smoking, alcohol drinking, geographical location, cumulative arsenic exposure and history of hypertension or dyslipidemia. A significant association of DM with cancers of the stomach (HR, 1.75; 95% CI: 1.12-2.76), colon (HR, 1.76; 95% CI: 1.20-2.59), liver (HR, 2.46; 95% CI: 1.81-3.34), pancreas (HR, 2.80; 95% CI: 1.30-6.20) and lungs (HR, 1.35; 95% CI: 1.04-1.76) was observed. The association with lung, bladder and kidney cancer was largely confined to diabetic patients with arsenic level in consumed water 5001.tg/L, while the association with other cancer sites did not show such an effect. With the adjustment of arsenic exposure, marked attenuation for the association was observed, suggesting high level arsenic exposure plays an important role in the development of diabetes mellitus and concomitantly lung, bladder and kidney cancer.

2013.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,The first fossil skull of Alligator sinensis from the Pleistocene Taiwan with a paleogeographic implication of the species,Shan H;Cheng Y;Wu X,"A nearly complete fossil skull of Alligatoridae from the Pleistocene, Penghu Channel, east of Taiwan, is reported. It can be referred to the most latest clade of Alligatorinae, which includes Alligator sinensis, Alligator mississippiensis and Alligator mefferdi, on the basis of the following features: the splenial is excluded from the mandibular symphysis; the anterior tip of the splenial passes dorsal to the Meckelian groove; and the mandible is gently curved between the fourth alveoli and the mid dentary. It differs from A. mississippiensis and A. mefferdi mainly in the following characters: the breadth between the supratemporal fenestrae is approximately equal to the interorbital width, the snout is about half the length of the skull; and the anterior part of the snout is subtriangular in dorsal view. These features suggest that the Penghu alligator is most probably referable to A. sinensis. This is the only fossil skull of A. sinensis known. The discovery of the skull in Penghu Channel not only provides the first solid fossil evidence to indicate that the geological distribution of A. sinensis extended farther southeast than the historical/archeological range of the species but also adds new information on the biodiversity of the Penghu fauna.

This is the first discovery of the Eocene tuff exposed in the Western Foothills. The proposed Miocene ""Tsukeng Formation"" and ""Takeng Formation"" of Ho et al. (1956) named for sequences exposed in the Nantou area, Western Foothills, have to be abandoned and the standard Oligocene-Miocene lithostratigraphy used commonly in the Western Foothills of northern Taiwan is properly applicable in central Taiwan. The thick pink-brown-green colored volcanics unconformably beneath the uppermost Wuchihshan Formation is named for the first time as the Pinglin Tuff which contains Late Middle Eocene calcareous nannofossils (Zone NP16) consistent with a U-Pb age dating (38.8 +/- 1 Ma) on zircon grains in the tuff. The Pinglin Tuff is overlying the Middle Eocene Chungliao Formation which contains indigenous larger foraminifera Discocyclina dispansa ex. interc. sella-dispansa and calcareous nannofossils of Zones NP14-15. The Middle Eocene Pinglin Tuff and Chungliao Formation represent the Paleogene syn-rift sequence unconformably overlain by the Latest Oligocene-Miocene post-rift sequence. This is the first document with conclusive paleontological data and age dating showing an occurrence of Paleogene marine rift basin exposed in the Western Foothills.

2013.0,J.

Samples were collected from outcrops, soils, fluvial, lake, and marine sediment environments. Initial Ti/Al molar ratios of sediments are controlled by those of parent soils or rocks. These ratios tend to decline gradually as a result of heavy-mineral gravity fractionation during transportation. Sedimentary Ti/Al molar ratios in sink areas such as lakes and pelagic environments are lower than those in source regions. In this study, for the Changjiang River, Huanghe River, and Kaoping River, Ti/Al molar ratios decline considerably from downstream to estuary environments. Additionally, well sorted aeolian sands have extremely low Ti/Al molar ratios in northern China. The Ti/Al molar ratios of aerosol particles found in Taiwan and the East China Sea show reduced ratios as a result of Asia Dust Storm episodes. Furthermore, lower Ti/Al molar ratios in deep ocean sediments were discovered by tracing the distribution of sedimentary Ti/Al molar ratios in the South China Sea. When sea levels dropped during glacial periods, the river estuary was closer to deep marine areas and carried more terrestrial sediments into deep marine environments. The closer estuary with relatively higher Ti/Al ratio would lead increase of Ti/Al molar ratios in deep sea sediments. In this study, Ti/Al molar ratio is promoted as a new proxy to help with understanding changes in sedimentary environments. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

2013.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,The volcanoes of an oceanic arc from origin to destruction A case from the northern Luzon Arc,Lai Y;Song S,"Volcanoes were created, grew, uplifted, became dormant or extinct, and were accreted as part of continents during continuous arc-continent collision. Volcanic rocks in Eastern Taiwan's Coastal Range (CR) are part of the northern Luzon Arc, an oceanic island arc produced by the subduction of the South China Sea Plate beneath the Philippine Sea Plate. Igneous rocks are characterized by intrusive bodies, lava and pyroclastic flows, and volcaniclastic rocks with minor tephra deposits. Based on volcanic fades associations, Sr-Nd isotopic geochemistry, and the geography of the region, four volcanoes were identified in the CR: Yuemei, Chimei, Chengkuangao, and Tuluanshan. Near-vent facies associations show different degrees of erosion in the volcanic edifices for Chimei, Chengkuangao, and Tuluanshan. Yuemei lacks near-vent rocks, implying that Yuemei's main volcanic body may have been subducted at the Ryukyu Trench with the northward motion of the Philippine Sea Plate. These data suggest a hypothesis for the evolution of volcanism and geomorphology during arc growth and ensuing arc-continent collision in the northern Luzon Arc, which suggests that these volcanoes were formed from the seafloor, emerging as islands during arc volcanism. They then became dormant or extinct during collision, and finally, were uplifted and accreted by additional collision. The oldest volcano, Yuemei, may have already been subducted into the Ryukyu Trench.

2013.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Threedimensional seismic attenuation structure beneath the Taiwan region and its tectonic implication,Cheng W,"Three-dimensional (3-D) attenuation structures were determined for Taiwan region by inversion of earthquake intensity data set. The seismic intensity which is assumed to be a measure of the maximum acceleration of the S-wave at the seismic station is used to estimate the attenuation structure. The intensity data' set consists of about 5500 intensity readings for 1410 earthquakes reported by the Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan from 1987 to 2010. The 3-D attenuation maps consisting of five layers were constructed to a depth of 74 km. The obtained model reveals the following features: first, a high absorption zone exists in the western-most Okinawa trough. These high-attenuation anomalies seem to extend from upper crust to mantle beneath the Yilan Plain and Kueishantao Island. We interpret the high absorption zone as the presence of the relatively hot lower crust and uppermost mantle in response to the local opening of the Okinawa trough. Second, strong lateral variation of seismic attenuation is observed from the source region of the Chi-Chi earthquake in the central Taiwan. Most aftershocks were occurred beneath the Western Foothills which is characterized by a transition from high attenuation to low attenuation between the Chelungpu fault and Chuchih fault. However, the region east to the Chuchih fault is relatively quiescent. This study suggests that the high Vp/Vs and lateral variation of attenuation features existing beneath the Western Foothills could be associated with porous materials containing fluid which might affect the generation of the Chi-Chi earthquake.

2014.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Accumulation of terrestrial organic carbon on an active continental margin offshore southwestern Taiwan Sourcetosink pathways of riverborne organic particles,Hsu F;Su C;Wang C;Lin S;Liu J;Huh C,"Sediment samples (213 sites) collected from the tectonic-active continental margin, offshore southwestern Taiwan were analyzed for grain sizes, organic carbon, nitrogen and carbon isotopic composition to obtain mass accumulation rate of terrestrial organic carbon and carbon budget to evaluate fate of terrestrial organic carbon from small mountainous rivers on the continental margin offshore southwestern Taiwan. Terrestrial organic carbon accumulation rates range from 0.29 to 45.6 g Cm-2 yr(-1) with a total accumulation budget of 0.063 Mt yr(-1), which accounts for less than 13% of total river particulate organic carbon loads exported from the adjacent rivers, the Gaoping (a.k.a., Kaoping), Erhjen and Tsengwen rivers. This low burial efficiency of terrestrial organic carbon demonstrated that a majority of river-borne particles together with organic materials was moved away from the study area. For the river-borne particles from the Gaoping river, a pair of depocenters in the upper slope flanking the Gaoping submarine canyon are the locations where the maximum TCorg accumulation rate were observed which hold up to 45% (0.016 Mt yr(-1)) of the calculated accumulation found in the study region. On the other hand, the occurrence of higher-fraction terrestrial organic carbon in the upper and middle Gaoping submarine canyon suggests that a majority of particulate organic carbon of the Gaoping river was transported directly into the deep-sea basin through the Gaoping submarine canyon. Our results demonstrated that active margin with narrow shelf and slope is not an efficient sink for the large amount of terrigenous organic carbon supplied by the small rivers, but, a transient environment for these river derived particles.

2014.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Authigenesis of vivianite as influenced by methaneinduced sulfidization in coldseep sediments off southwestern Taiwan,Hsu T;Jiang W;Wang Y,"Authigenesis of iron-rich phosphate nodules occurs in iron-rich cold-seep sediments (MD052911 core) at Yung-An Ridge offshore southwestern Taiwan. Raman, FTIR, and quantitative X-ray energy-dispersive spectroscopic analyses indicate that the phosphate mineral is vivianite (or baricite) and shows Fe/Mg molar ratios spanning from ca. 0.6 to 4.0 and a general down core trend of increasing Fe/Mg ratios. The formation of vivianite is limited to a depth interval of 13-17 mbsf (meters below seafloor) and is most prominent at similar to 16 mbsf in association with high dissolved iron concentrations and depleted dissolved sulfide below a peak sulfidization zone (enriched in mackinawite and greigite). Alternate growths of vivianite and iron monosulfides and compositional zoning with Mg enriched towards the peripheries of individual nodules occur in the transition from the zone of vivianite mineralization to the sulfidization zone. The crystallization of vivianite below the sulfidization front could have been favored by scavenging of downward diffusive dissolved sulfide from pore waters in the sulfidization zone. Alternate growths and overlapping of the zones of iron monosulfides and vivianite can be attributed to fluctuations of the sulfidization front and methane flux. The discovery of vivianite in the Yung-An Ridge sediments implies that authigenic vivianite can be an important sink for phosphorus burial in cold-seep sediments that have high reactive-iron contents and high sedimentation rates.

2014.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Comparison of subtropical surface water chemistry between the large Pearl River in China and small mountainous rivers in Taiwan,Lou J;Chen C;Lui H;Selvaraj K;Zhang S;Lu X,"Small mountainous rivers in Oceania typically have higher sediment yields than larger rivers because of their steep gradients and frequent tropical storm-induced high rainfall. The high sediment yields of these small mountainous rivers enable them to transport a large amount of terrigenous material to the oceans. However, data are unfortunately sparse on this topic. In this study, we investigated the water quality and sediment geochemistry of 35 small rivers in Taiwan and compared these data with that of the large Pearl River. Although Taiwan and the Pearl River Basin are both traversed by the Tropic of Cancer, and thus have similar weather patterns, their water chemistry is quite different. The most notable difference is that despite higher rainfall in Taiwan, and hence, a larger dilution effect, the total dissolved solid concentration (TDS), Me+2, Ne++K+, Cl-, and SO4-2 are generally higher in the Taiwanese rivers compared to the Pearl River. On the other hand, the sediment load in Taiwanese rivers is higher compared with the Pearl River, as expected. These observations reflect the higher rate of chemical weathering and denudation in Taiwan due to its steeper terrain and the larger impact of typhoons, hence episodic heavy rains in that region. The pattern of distribution vs. altitude is also different, with higher TDS, Ca+2, Mg+2, HCO3- and pH values at higher altitudes in the Pearl River Basin, whereas these values are lower at higher elevations in Taiwan. We see this difference because the upper reaches of the Pearl River are primarily covered with limestone, whereas the high mountains of Taiwan are mainly composed of slate and schist that are more resistant to chemical weathering and less affected by acid rain compared with limestone. Pollution-related parameters such as non-sea-salt SO4-2 (nss-SO4-2), nss-SO4/(Na++K+) and Cl-/(Na++K+) also suggest that rivers in Taiwan are much more polluted than the Pearl River Basin, perhaps due to the widespread burning of coal and plastic-laden refuse in Taiwan.

2014.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Crustal and upper mantle Swave velocity structures across the Taiwan Strait from ambient seismic noise and teleseismic Rayleigh wave analyses,Huang Y;Yao H;Wu F;Liang W;Huang B;Lin C;Wen K,"Although orogeny tapers off in western Taiwan large and small earthquakes do occur in the Taiwan Strait, a region largely untouched in previous studies owing mostly to logistical reasons. But the overall crustal structure of this region is of particular interest as it may provide a hint of the proto-Taiwan before the orogeny. By combining time domain empirical Green's function (TDEGF) from ambient seismic noise using station-pairs and traditional surface wave two-station method (TS) we are able to construct Rayleigh wave phase velocity dispersion curves between 5 and 120 s. Using Broadband Array in Taiwan for Seismology (BATS) stations in Taiwan and in and across the Strait we are able to derive average 1-D Vs structures in different parts of this region. The results show significant shear velocity differences in the upper 15 km crust as expected. In general, the highest Vs in the upper crust observed in the coastal area of Mainland China and the lowest Vs appears along the southwest offshore of the Taiwan Island; they differ by about 0.6-1.1 km/s. For different parts of the Strait, the upper crust Vs structures are lower in the middle by about 0.1-0.2 km/s relative to those in the northern and southern parts. The upper mantle Vs structure (Moho - 150 km) beneath the Taiwan Strait is about 0.1-0.3 km/s lower than the AK135 model. The overall crustal thickness is approximately 30 km, much thinner and less variable than under the Taiwan Island. The inversion of seismic velocity structures using shorter period band dispersion data in the sea areas with water depth deeper than 1000 m should take water layer into consideration except for the continental shelves.

Asian Earth Sci.,Curie point depth from spectral analysis of magnetic data in Taiwan,Hsieh H;Chen C;Lin P;Yen H,"This study constructs an integrated magnetic anomaly map of Taiwan and its vicinity that combines land magnetic data and marine magnetic data. The reduction to pole (RTP) correction method was applied to the integrated magnetic anomaly data. The corrected magnetic anomaly results for a region roughly 880 km in width and 660 km in length fit well with geological tectonic signatures and are used to estimate the Curie point isotherm. The adopted Curie point depth method provides a relationship between the 2-D FFT power spectrum of the magnetic anomalies and the depth of magnetic sources by transforming the spatial data into the frequency domain. The basal depth of the magnetic sources is calculated from the magnetic data. Finally, the Curie point depth of Taiwan is obtained. The highest value of 17 km is located in northern Taiwan, and the lowest value of 6 km is located at southern Taiwan and also has the highest thermal gradient of 88 degrees C/km. The Curie point depth is consistent with heat-flow measurements with correlation coefficient 0.62. (C) 2014 The Authors.

2014.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Development of tectonostratigraphy in distal part of foreland basin in southwestern Taiwan,Yang K;Wu J;Cheng E;Chen Y;Huang W;Tsai C;Wang J;Ting H,"In the young and active tectonic belt of southwestern Taiwan, reconstructed stratigraphy in the distal part of the foreland basin reveals at least two regional unconformities with the younger ones covering the areas farther from the mountain belt. In contrast with the previously proposed monotonous basin development, the temporal-spatial distribution of the unconformities indicates the back-and-forth migration of the foreland basin margin. Three distinct episodes of rapid subsidence during the foreland basin development have also been identified. The onset of the basin development can be well constrained by the initial rapid subsidence at 4.4-4.2 Ma, which happened only in the proximal part of the basin. This was followed by two younger episodes of rapid subsidence events at 2-1.8 Ma and 0.45 Ma, which were encountered initially in the areas progressively farther from the orogenic belt. We propose a model of episodic tectonic evolution in the distal part of the foreland basin in southwestern Taiwan. During each episode of rapid subsidence, uplifting that corresponds to the forebulge began with a concurrent rapid subsidence in the areas closer to the basin center and was followed by rapid subsidence and deposition of widespread strata onlapping toward the basin margin. Part of the widespread strata and its overlying deposits would be eroded in the beginning of the next episode when the forebulge shifted toward the orogenic belt. In general, rate of forebulge migrating away from the orogenic belt during the early stage was slower than that derived from a previously proposed kinematic model of a steady migration of the orogenic belt. This might be due to a rifted and weaker lithosphere beneath the foreland basin. Once the foreland basin migrated onto the less stretched lithosphere, the basin would expand rapidly into the craton.

Asian Earth Sci.,Distribution and characters of the mud diapirs and mud volcanoes off southwest Taiwan,Chen S;Hsu S;Wang Y;Chung S;Chen P;Tsai C;Liu C;Lin H;Lee Y,"In order to identify the mud diapirs and mud volcanoes off SW Taiwan, we have examined similar to 1500 km long MCS profiles and related marine geophysical data. Our results show ten quasi-linear mud diapirs, oriented NNE-SSW to N-S directions. Thirteen mud volcanoes are identified from the multibeam bathymetric data. These mud volcanoes generally occur on tops of the diapiric structures. Moreover, the active mud flow tracks out of mud volcanoes MV1, MV3 and MV6 are observed through the high backscatter intensity stripes on the sidescan sonar images. The heights of the cone-shaped mud volcanoes range from 65 m to 345 m, and the diameters at base from 680 m to 4100 m. These mud volcanoes have abrupt slopes between 5.3 degrees and 13.6 degrees, implying the mudflow is active and highly viscous. In contrast, the flat crests of mud volcanoes are due to relative lower-viscosity flows. The larger cone-shaped mud volcanoes located at deeper water depths could be related to a longer eruption history. The formation of mud diapirs and volcanoes in the study area are ascribed to the overpressure in sedimentary layers, compressional tectonic forces and gas-bearing fluids. Especially, the gas-bearing fluid plays an important role in enhancing the intrusion after the diapirism as a large amount of gas expulsions is observed. The morphology of the upper Kaoping Slope is mainly controlled by mud diapiric intrusions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

2014.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Distributions and assemblages of microbial communities along a sediment core retrieved from a potential hydratebearing region offshore southwestern Taiwan,Lin L;Wu L;Cheng T;Tu W;Lin J;Yang T;Chen P;Wang Y;Wang P,"Assessing the impacts of methane released from hydrate-bearing environments on global carbon cycling would require detailed insights into the distributions and capacities of microbial communities at different horizons of sediment column. In this study, we conducted geochemical, gene abundance and diversity analyses for a sediment core retrieved from a potential hydrate-bearing region off southwestern Taiwan. Geochemical profiles were characterized by a sulfate-to-methane transition with decreasing total organic carbon and nitrogen in sediments, and increasing dissolved inorganic carbon, ammonium and total sulfur in sediments. Bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA and amoA gene abundances decreased with depth. In contrast, ANME-1 and -2 16S rRNA gene abundances increased significantly across the sulfate-to-methane transition and peaked at different horizons below this interface. A total of 124,379 bacterial and 130,351 archaeal reads were recovered through tag-pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes and categorized into 9014 bacterial and 6394 archaeal operational taxonomic units on the basis of 97% sequence similarity, respectively. Major bacterial phyla/divisions and archaeal groups (>5% of the total reads) detected included Chloroflexi, Planctomycetes, OP9, Deltaproteobacteria, BHI80-139, MBG-B, Halobacteria, MCG, Thermoplasmata, ANME-1 and MG-I. The abundance variations of most major OTUs (>0.5% of the total reads) were statistically correlated with those of geochemical parameters. These lines of evidence suggest that the populations represented by the major OTUs or detected by group-specific primers were compartmentalized into different horizons and involved directly or indirectly in the cycling of methane, sulfate, organic carbon and nitrogen. Overall, this study demonstrates that the deep sequencing coverage combined with the quantification of gene abundance and geochemical characterization would enable to uncover the detailed distributions and potential metabolic capabilities of specific groups from complexly structured microbial communities in methane-rich marine sediments.

2014.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Evolution of coseismic faultrelated folds induced by the ChiChi earthquake A case study of the Wufeng site Central Taiwan by using 2D distinct element modeling,Yang Y;Hu J;Lin M,"Coseismic fault-propagation folds are generally associated with blind faults, which are of considerable academic interest and have recently been recognized as critical for assessing seismic hazards. The Wufeng excavation site was characterized by a major east-dipping basal thrust exhibiting a dip angle of 340 and 2 opposing vergent thrusts generated a pop-up anticlinal fold in soil cover induced by the 1999 ChiChi earthquake (M-w = 7.6). In order to represent the soft soil behavior, we set up a direct shear simulation test to obtain valid parameters for soil. A series of 2D distinct element models possessing different bonding types and strengths was conducted to determine the deformation pattern near the surface and the evolution of the fault tip propagation. The coseismic deformation features of soft and plastic soil cover like the mutative limb thickness, complex ruptures and the overturned forelimbs in small-scale caused by the propagation of the blind fault tip were accurately predicted by contact-bond model in which grains were allowed to rotate and slip without cements breaking. Our results show that the alternative thrusts and pop-up structure developed before the main basal thrust fault ruptured through the ground surface at the Wufeng excavation site. We evaluated the slipping distance of the main fault at approximately 6 m in Wufeng during the 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

2014.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Geological variation in Swave velocity structures in Northern Taiwan and implications for seismic hazards based on ambient noise analysis,Lai Y;Huang B;Huang Y;Yao H;Hwang R;Huang Y;Chang W,"Ambient noise analysis in Northern Taiwan revealed obvious lateral variations related to major geological units. The empirical Green's functions extracted from interstation ambient noise were regarded as Rayleigh waves, from which we analyzed the group velocities for period from 3 to 6 s. According to geological features, we divided Northern Taiwan into seven subregions, for which regionalized group velocities were derived by using the pure-path method. On average, the group velocities in mountain areas were higher than those in the plain areas. We subsequently inverted the S-wave velocity structure for each subregion down to 6 km in depth. Following the analysis, we proposed the first models of geology-dependent shallow S-wave structures in Northern Taiwan. Overall, the velocity increased substantially from west to east; specifically, the mountain areas, composed of metamorphic rocks, exhibited higher velocities than did the coastal plain and basin, which consist of soft sediment. At a shallow depth, the Western Coastal Plain, Taipei Basin, and Ilan Plain displayed a larger velocity gradient than did other regions. At the top 3 km of the model, the average velocity gradient was 039 km/s per km for the Western Coastal Plain and 0.15 km/s per km for the Central Range. These S-wave velocity models with large velocity gradients caused the seismic waves to become trapped easily in strata and, thus, the ground motion was amplified. The regionalized S-wave velocity models derived from ambient noises can provide useful information regarding seismic wave propagation and for assessing seismic hazards in Northern Taiwan.

2014.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Heat flow in the rifted continental margin of the South China Sea near Taiwan and its tectonic implications,Liao W;Lin A;Liu C;Oung J;Wang Y,"Temperature measurements carried out on 9 hydrocarbon exploration boreholes together with Bottom Simulating Reflectors (BSRs) from reflection seismic images are used in this study to derive geothermal gradients and heat flows in the northern margin of the South China Sea near Taiwan. The method of Horner plot is applied to obtain true formation temperatures from measured borehole temperatures, which are disturbed by drilling processes. Sub-seafloor depths of BSRs are used to calculate sub-bottom temperatures using theoretical pressure/temperature phase boundary that marks the base of gas hydrate stability zone. Our results show that the geothermal gradients and heat flows in the study area range from 28 to 128 degrees C/km and 40 to 159 mW/m(2), respectively. There is a marked difference in geothermal gradients and heat flow beneath the shelf and slope regions. It is cooler beneath the shelf with an average geothermal gradient of 34.5 degrees C/km, and 62.7 mW/m(2) heat flow. The continental slope shows a higher average geothermal gradient of 56.4 degrees C/km, and 70.9 mW/m(2) heat flow. Lower heat flow on the shelf is most likely caused by thicker sediments that have accumulated there compared to the sediment thickness beneath the slope. In addition, the continental crust is highly extended beneath the continental slope, yielding higher heat flow in this region. A half graben exists beneath the continental slope with a north-dipping graben-bounding fault. A high heat-flow anomaly coincides at the location of this graben-bounding fault at the Jiulong Ridge, indicating vigorous vertical fluid convection which may take place along this fault.

To assess denudation rates that are statistically significant, we applied both the mean square weighted deviation approach and the bootstrap technique. For the central segment of the belt, where the collision is considered to be near mature, the orogen-scale pattern of denudation shows a two-fold pattern: (1) higher denudation values on the order of 4-5mm/yr characterize the eastern side of the belt (i.e., retro-wedge), with a slight increase towards the south and (2) lower denudation values on the order of 1-3mm/yr on the western side of the belt (pro-wedge) with a minimum value centered on the main recess of the deformation front. To the north and to the south of the central segment, the denudation rates converge towards lower values on the order of 2-3mm/yr.

2014.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Imaging seismic velocities for hydratebearing sediments using converted waves near YuanAn Ridge off southwest Taiwan,Cheng W;Shih T;Lin W;Wang T;Liu C;Wang Y,"Data from P-waves and from S-waves generated by P-S conversion on reflection from airgun shots recorded along four lines of ocean bottom seismometers were used to construct 2-D velocity sections near the Yuan-An Ridge, off southwest Taiwan. The locations of the ocean bottom seismometers were determined to high accuracy by an inversion based on the shot traveltimes. Traveltime inversion and forward modeling of multicomponent wide-angle seismic data result in detailed P-wave (Vp) and S-wave (Vs) velocities of hydrate-bearing sediment layers. The inversion indicates a relatively high P-wave velocity beneath topographic ridges which represent a series of thrust-cored anticlines develop in the accretionary wedge. S-wave velocities of the sediments over the entire section, down to 400 m below seafloor, range from 320 to 570 ms(-1). We suggested the lateral variation in Vp/Vs profiles in the hydrate-affected zones may be related to the migration conduit of gas-rich fluid and a characteristic of hydrate content. We model Vp using equations based on a modification of Wood's equation to estimate the gas hydrate saturation. The hydrate saturation varies from 5% at the top similar to 200 m below the seafloor to 10-15% of pore space close to the bottom simulating reflector (BSR) in the survey area. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

2014.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Marine controlled source electromagnetic method used for the gas hydrate investigation in the offshore area of SW Taiwan,Hsu S;Chiang C;Evans R;Chen C;Chiu S;Ma Y;Chen S;Tsai C;Lin S;Wang Y,"Bottom simulating reflectors (BSRs), high methane flux, shallow sulfide/methane interfaces, fluids venting from the seafloor, authigenic carbonates within sediments, methane reefs, and self-biomes are common seafloor features in the area off southwest Taiwan. The geophysical and geochemical signatures of these features suggest a high potential for gas hydrate (GH) reservoirs in the region. The BSRs are typically interpreted as the boundary between free gases and solid hydrate, whereas the upper reaches of the hydrate stability zone and the distribution of gas hydrate in shallow sediments are not well understood. This study shows the first results of a marine controlled-source electromagnetic survey, conducted in the offshore area of SW Taiwan in 2010. The survey aimed to provide electrical resistivity information of the shallow sediments. Three target areas were surveyed: (1) an area to the southeast of the Xiaoliuchiu Island (gas seep G96), (2) an area in the west of the Yung-An Ridge (YAR) and (3) an area in the northwest of the Good Weather Ridge (GWR). In total, fourteen survey lines with a total length of 72 km were completed. Our preliminary results show that relatively high resistivity anomalies occur within pockmarks and at gas seepage sites. The apparent resistivity is estimated to be about 1 Ohm-m higher than background in G96 and YAR sites, while an anomaly up to 2 Ohm-m is found in the GWR. At gas seep site G96, the high resistivity anomaly may be due to the existence of authigenic carbonates; whereas, the high resistivity anomaly in the NW of the GWR site may also be due to the existence of gas hydrate in the shallow seabed. Based on the resistivity anomaly, the gas hydrate saturation is about 16% in the shallow sediments below the pockmark area in the northwest side of the GWR site. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This moderately large event was located in the Longitudinal Valley, a suture zone of the Philippine Sea Plate and the Eurasia Plate. A joint source inversion analysis by using teleseismic body wave, GPS coseismic displacement and near field ground motion data was performed first. The inversion results derived from a western dipping fault plane indicate that the slip occurred in depths between 10 and 20 km. The rupture propagated from south to north and two asperities were resolved. The largest one was located approximately 15 km north of the epicenter with a maximum slip about 1 m. A 3D seismic wave propagation simulation based on the spectral-element method was then carried out by using the inverted source model. A strong rupture directivity effect in the northern area of the Longitudinal Valley was found, which was due to the northward rupture process. Forward synthetic waveforms could explain most of the near-field ground motion data for frequencies between 0.05 and 0.2 Hz. This numerical earthquake model not only helps us confirm the detailed rupture processes on the Central Range Fault but also gives contribution to regional seismic hazard mitigation for future large earthquakes.

Both petrographic study and detrital zircon U-Pb ages show that the Middle-Late Miocene turbidite sequences were primarily derived from Mesozoic granites and volcanic rocks of the Cathaysian Block in SE China, which were transported southeastward via rivers like Minjiang and jiulongjiang to the Taiwan area. This conclusion is further supported by Nd isotope analyses of shales intercalated within sandstone sequences showing negative epsilon Nd values (-13.3 to -10.5) of a continental origin. During the Late Miocene when global sea-level fell significantly, the SE China coastline shifted seaward to the eastern part of the present Taiwan Strait, which would have facilitated these continent-derived sediments being transported southeastward to the shelf-upper slope of the Chinese continental margin. These turbidite sequences were then deformed and accreted into the accretionary prism of the Hengchun Peninsula when the South China Sea oceanic lithosphere subducted eastward beneath the Philippine Sea Plate in the Late Miocene. Our study suggests that sedimentary deposition of the turbidite sequences in the Hengchun Peninsula could be strongly controlled by different river system supply, submarine channeling transport and fluctuations of sea-level.

2014.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Seismic behavior in central Taiwan Response to stress evolution following the 1999 Mw 76 ChiChi earthquake,Chan C;Wu Y,"Following the 1999 M-w 7.6 Chi-Chi earthquake, a large amount of seismicity occurred in the Nantou region of central Taiwan. Among the seismic activities, eight M-w >= 5.8 earthquakes took place following the Chi-Chi earthquake, whereas only four earthquakes with comparable magnitudes took place from 1900 to 1998. Since the seismicity rate during the Chi-Chi postseismic period has never returned to the background level, such seismicity activation cannot simply be attributed to modified Omori's Law decay. In this work, we attempted to associate seismic activities with stress evolution. Based on our work, it appears that the spatial distribution of the consequent seismicity can be associated with increasing coseismic stress. On the contrary, the stress changes imparted by the afterslip; lower crust-upper mantle viscoelastic relaxation; and sequent events resulted in a stress drop in most of the study region. Understanding seismogenic mechanisms in terms of stress evolution would be beneficial to seismic hazard mitigation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

2014.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Slab interactions in the Taiwan region based on the P and Svelocity distributions in the upper mantle,Koulakov I;Wu Y;Huang H;Dobretsov N;Jakovlev A;Zabelina I;Jaxybulatov K;Chervov V,"We present a new model of P- and S-velocity anomalies in the upper mantle beneath the Taiwan region based on the inversion of travel time data from the global International Seismological Center (ISC) catalog. We clearly observed the anomalies of high P- and S-velocities associated with the subducting plates beneath the Ryukyu and Luzon arcs. At depths in the range of 100-200 km, the anomalies related to both slabs seem to be connected, which might be evidence of the lithosphere collision of the two oppositely oriented subduction zones. This model has been carefully verified using different synthetic tests. Based on the derived seismic model, we propose a model of recent plate reconstructions in the region around Taiwan. Initially, we presume the existence of two oppositely oriented subduction zones underneath the Luzon Island and the Ryukyu arc, separated with a transform fault. The NW movement of the Philippine Sea Plate led to first a shortening and then a disappearance of this transform fault. As a result, the edge of the Luzon arc collided with the edge of the Ryukyu arc. Simple simulations indicate that in this edge area, very strong stresses and deformation might take place that result in significant shortening of the earth surface. We believe that the origin of the Taiwan island was caused by the collisional processes due to the interaction of the two subduction zones. Note that in this case, no other conditions, such as the existence of arcs and/or buoyant continental crustal blocks, are required to explain the origin of the thick, strongly shortened crust in Taiwan.

2014.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Toward realtime regional earthquake simulation II Realtime Online earthquake Simulation ROS of Taiwan earthquakes,Lee S;Liu Q;Tromp J;Komatitsch D;Liang W;Huang B,"We developed a Real-time Online earthquake Simulation system (ROS) to simulate regional earthquakes in Taiwan. The ROS uses a centroid moment tensor solution of seismic events from a Real-time Moment Tensor monitoring system (RMT), which provides all the point source parameters including the event origin time, hypocentral location, moment magnitude and focal mechanism within 2 min after the occurrence of an earthquake. Then, all of the source parameters are automatically forwarded to the ROS to perform an earthquake simulation, which is based on a spectral-element method (SEM). A new island-wide, high resolution SEM mesh model is developed for the whole Taiwan in this study. We have improved SEM mesh quality by introducing a thin high-resolution mesh layer near the surface to accommodate steep and rapidly varying topography. The mesh for the shallow sedimentary basin is adjusted to reflect its complex geometry and sharp lateral velocity contrasts. The grid resolution at the surface is about 545 m, which is sufficient to resolve topography and tomography data for simulations accurate up to 1.0 Hz. The ROS is also an infrastructural service, making online earthquake simulation feasible. Users can conduct their own earthquake simulation by providing a set of source parameters through the ROS webpage. For visualization, a ShakeMovie and ShakeMap are produced during the simulation. The time needed for one event is roughly 3 min for a 70 s ground motion simulation. The ROS is operated online at the Institute of Earth Sciences, Academia Sinica (http://ros.earth.sinica.edu.tw/). Our long-term goal for the ROS system is to contribute to public earth science outreach and to realize seismic ground motion prediction in real-time. (C) 2014 The Authors.

2014.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Two dimensional fluid flow models at two gas hydrate sites offshore southwestern Taiwan,Chen L;Chi W;Wu S;Liu C;Shyu C;Wang Y;Lu C,"Fluid migration patterns are important for understanding gas hydrate and hydrocarbon systems. However, conducting experiments on or below the seafloor is difficult because crustal fluid flow rates are usually very slow, so long term observations are needed. Temperature can be used as a good tracer for studying fluid flows. Temperatures derived from bottom-simulating reflectors (BSRs) might help to understand fluid migration patterns in shallow marine sediments. In this study, we studied 2D fluid flow patterns in two potential gas hydrate provinces offshore southwestern Taiwan: the Yung-An Ridge in the active margin and Formosa Ridge in the passive margin. We used 2D bathymetry, average seafloor temperatures and regional geothermal gradients measured by thermal probes, as constraints to construct 2D theoretical conductive temperature fields using finite element methods. We then compared the BSR-based temperature with the theoretical conductive temperature field. The results show a temperature discrepancy attributed to advective heat transfer due to fluid migration. For the Yung-An Ridge, the BSR-based temperatures are about 2 degrees C higher than the model: Especially in (1) near a fault zone, (2) under the eastern flank where there are strong seismic reflectors in a pseudo-3D seismic dataset, and (3) near a fissure zone. For the Formosa Ridge, our results showed a distinct decrease in temperatures around the southern peak of the ridge, where an active gas plume was found. BSR-based temperatures predict on average 2 degrees C lower than the model. At these two sites, the shallow temperature fields are strongly affected by 2D bathymetry. However, new insights regarding fluid flow patterns can be obtained using this model approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

2015.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,A threedimensional Vp Vs and VpVs crustal structure in Fujian Southeast China from active and passivesource experiments,Cai H;Hao K;Jin X;Wang C;Huang B;Yen H,"Fujian, Southeastern China, has experienced multistage tectonic activities since the Neoproterozoic Era and is currently influenced by collision between the Eurasian and Philippine Sea plates. Topography, fault zones, and patterns of seismicity are the imprints of tectonic evolution. Historically, there have been several catastrophic earthquakes in the southeastern part of Fujian. To understand the crustal structure related to the fault zones, we performed Vp, Vs, and Vp/Vs travel-time tomography using joint inversion of active and passive sources. A total of 75,827 and 31,044 arrivals of P and S waves, respectively, from 33 explosions and 2543 earthquakes are used in our study. As a result, seismicity has indicated that two NE strike seismogenic zones, the Zhenghe-Dapu and Changle-Zhaoan fault zones, are currently active. Low Vp/Vs ratios in inland Fujian imply that the crust is mainly composed of felsic rocks as part of the Eurasian continental crust, which is consistent with geological observations at the surface. Based on Vp tomography, the thickness of the crust along the coastline is shallower than that on land, which is related to higher heat flow and the Bouguer anomaly. This shallow crust phenomenon near the coastline could be related to the regional extensional stress: the remaining structure of the back-arc extension that stretched the continental crust during the Mesozoic Era or/and the Cenozoic extension due to South China sea opening in Taiwan Strait.

2015.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Active tear faulting in Hsinchu Taiwan A potential threat to Taiwans economy,Yeh Y;Wang W;Chang C;Wen S;Wu W,"Two unusual earthquake swarms struck Hsinchu County in northern Taiwan, near the Hsinchu Science and Industrial Park (HSIP), in 2012 and 2014. In this study, we analyze the focal mechanisms and conduct stress inversion for these swarms and three earthquake clusters located between them. Our results show that both swarms were dominated by right-lateral strike-slip events along a prominent lineation in NW direction. These earthquake ruptures may occur along two previously unrecognized tear faults as they were clearly associated with structural bends in the area. In between, NNE-NE-striking, high-angle reverse-faulting events with left-lateral strike-slip motions were dominant. The faults associated with these events may have originated as horse blocks in a strike-slip duplex bounded by the two tear faults that later rotated clockwise, resulting in bookshelf faulting. Our results suggest the Hsinchu Science and Industrial Park could be under threat of these two nearby tear faults. As the Hsinchu Science and Industrial Park creates about 36% of Taiwan's total trade surplus, our findings urge innovative thinking for hazard mitigation in Hsinchu County to reduce the potential impact on Taiwan's economy.

2015.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Estimating the extent of stress influence by using earthquake triggering groundwater level variations in Taiwan,Wang S;Hsu K;Lai W;Wang C,"Groundwater level variations associated with earthquake events may reveal useful information. This study estimates the extent of stress influence, defined as the distance over which an earthquake can induce a step change of the groundwater level, using earthquake-triggering groundwater level variations in Taiwan. Groundwater variations were first characterized based on the dynamics of groundwater level changes dominantly triggered by earthquakes. The step-change data in co-seismic groundwater level variations were used to analyze the extent of stress influence for earthquakes. From the data analysis, the maximum extent of stress influence is 250 km around Taiwan. A two-dimensional approach was adopted to develop two models for estimating the maximum extent of stress influence for earthquakes. From the developed models, the extent of stress influence is proportional to the earthquake magnitude and inversely proportional to the groundwater level change. The model equations can be used to calculate the influence radius of stress from an earthquake by using the observed change of groundwater level and the earthquake magnitude. The models were applied to estimate the area of anomalous stress, defined as the possible areas where the strain energy is accumulated, using the cross areas method. The results show that the estimated area of anomalous stress is close to the epicenter. Complex geological structures and material heterogeneity and anisotropy may explain this disagreement. More data collection and model refinements can improve the proposed model. This study shows the potential of using groundwater level variations for capturing seismic information. The proposed concept of extent of stress influence can be used to estimate the earthquake effect in hydraulic engineering, mining engineering, and carbon dioxide sequestration, etc. This study provides a concept for estimating the possible areas of anomalous stress for a forthcoming earthquake.

2015.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Frequent excitations of T waves by earthquakes in the South Mariana Arc,Chen P;Chen K;Cheng H,"We used broadband stations in Taiwan and on the Ryukyu Arc islands to investigate T waves induced by earthquakes in the Izu-Bonin-Mariana subduction zone. Of the 48 earthquakes that took place in 2005, 17 earthquakes exhibited T-wave signals consistent with predicted arrival times at stations. Of theses T-excited events, 13 were located in the South Mariana Arc, where the isobaths exhibit strong concave curvature, and were predominantly of normal faulting type. The energies of observed T waves were used quantitatively to evaluate the relative efficiency of receiver-side acoustic-elastic conversions by Gamma calculations. Results show that the steep slopes of offshore bathymetry together with nearly perpendicular angles of back azimuth relative to local isobaths are suitable conditions for T waves observations. In 2010, two clusters of repeated moderate earthquakes in the north and south ends of the Mariana Arc displayed stark contrasts in terms of T-wave excitations despite their normal faulting type. Examining of this discrepancy indicate that a specific curvature together with a specific radiation pattern accounts for the frequent excitations of T waves from shallow earthquakes in the South Mariana Arc.

2015.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Late Holocene environment of subalpine northeastern Taiwan from pollen and diatom analysis of lake sediments,Wang L;Behling H;Kao S;Li H;Selvaraj K;Hsieh M;Chang Y,"We used multi-decadal pollen and diatom records from sediment core TFL-1 from Tsuifong Lake to reconstruct the vegetation dynamics and hydroclimate in northeastern Taiwan during the past 3500 cal BP. Coarse grained sediments in association with higher percentages of wetland pollen (Cyperaceae) and upper conifer pollen (Tsuga and Pinus) in the lower part of the core indicate low lake levels and a relatively cold/dry climate between 3500 and 2030 cal BP, reflecting a decline of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM). Muddy sediments coupled with reduction of wetland pollen represent the rise of lake levels, implying the re-strengthening of the EASM during the past 2000 years. Paleotemperature was inferred from the variation of pollen origin from the upper and lower mountain forest, indicating the global temperature anomalies of the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and the Little Ice Age (LIA). In comparison to the main climate forces in the North Pacific, we suggest that the long-term climatic trend in Taiwan was controlled by variations in EASM intensity, while increased precipitation over the past 2000 years may also be linked to warmer sea surface temperature (SST) of the western Pacific Warm Pool (WPWP) and increased El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, which increased typhoon intensity. Higher diatom-inferred pH during 2930-2030 cal BP and the LIA suggest strong hydrological disturbances, reflecting more typhoons passing over Taiwan. The frequent typhoon events could be linked by an abrupt shift of typhoon track, due to the reduction of the WPWP and expansion of the Northwestern Pacific High, which move typhoons in a more westerly direction.

2015.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Multiple seismoanomalies associated with the M61 Ludian earthquake on August 3 2014,Zeng X;Lin Y;Chen W;Bai Z;Liu J;Chen C,"Multiple geophysical parameters including groundwater level, water temperature, water radon, crustal deformation, electromagnetic waves and total electron contents (TEC) in the ionosphere, are examined together to investigate pre-earthquake anomalous phenomena associated with the Mw6.1 Ludian earthquake on August 3, 2014. Cross-parameter comparison eliminates anomalies that are detected in one parameter only and examine earthquake-related phenomena in various fields, simultaneously. Retrieved anomalies show that abnormal decreases of water temperature and radon concentration related to anomalous uplift of groundwater levels appeared about 1-8 days before the earthquake even without contributions from rain. Significant step-like changes are observed from data recorded by strainmeters on July 31 and are consistent with water-related anomalies in timing. No significant anomalies can be found from electromagnetic data through the preliminary observation. In contrast, TEC appeared positive anomalies 1-3 days before the Ludian earthquake. Although causal mechanisms of the TEC anomalies from stressed rocks are not fully understood, multiple-parameter examination can increase credibility of determination regarding pre-earthquake phenomena.

2015.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Numerical earthquake models of the 2013 Nantou Taiwan earthquake series Characteristics of source rupture processes strong ground motions and their tectonic implication,Lee S;Yeh T;Huang H;Lin C,"On 27 March and 2 June 2013, two large earthquakes with magnitudes of M-L 6.2 and M-L, 6.5, named the Nantou earthquake series, struck central Taiwan. These two events were located at depths of 15-20 km, which implied that the mid-crust of central Taiwan is an active seismogenic area even though the subsurface structures have not been well established. To determine the origins of the Nantou earthquake series, we investigated both the rupture processes and seismic wave propagations by employing inverse and forward numerical simulation techniques. Source inversion results indicated that one event ruptured from middle to shallow crust in the northwest direction, while the other ruptured towards the southwest. Simulations of 3-D wave propagation showed that the rupture characteristics of the two events result in distinct directivity effects with different amplified shaking patterns. From the results of numerical earthquake modeling, we deduced that the occurrence of the Nantou earthquake series may be related to stress release from the easternmost edge of a preexistent strong basement in central Taiwan.

2015.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Potential relationships between seismodeformation and seismoconductivity anomalies,Chen C;Lin C;Wang C;Liu J;Yeh T;Yen H;Lin T,"This study examines the relationships between seismo-deformation and seismo-conductivity anomalies during two M6 earthquakes that occurred on March 27th and June 2nd, 2013 in Taiwan. The Hilbert Huang Transform is applied on surface displacement data to remove the effects of noise, semi-annual and annual cycles, and the long-term plate movements. The residual displacements have similar orientations when earthquake-related stress accumulates in the crust. Once the accumulated stress approaches the threshold for fault rupture, the orientations of the residual displacements generally become random, except in a small region near the epicenter. Interestingly, high-conductivity anomalies, which can be detected from the 3-component magnetic data via the magnetic transfer function, exist in places very close to this small region near the epicenter. Spatial and temporal correlations between the high-conductivity anomalies and the small region of seismo-deformation anomalies suggest that electric charges may migrate and become trapped in the region during seismogenic processes due to differential stress accumulation. These electric charges form a high-conductivity material that affects the Parkinson vector of the geomagnetic field. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

2015.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Presentday surface deformation and tectonic insights of the extensional Ilan Plain NE Taiwan,Kang C;Chang C;Siame L;Lee J,"Taiwan's mountain belt is an ideal location to address major questions regarding mechanisms of lithospheric deformation in convergent settings, mountain building processes from oceanic subduction to continental subduction, and post orogenic extension. In the northeast of this belt, the Ilan Plain is a triangular, deltaic plain characterized by a flat topography close to the sea level, and surrounded by the high mountains of the Hsuehshan Range to the northwest, and the Central Range to the southeast. Its eastern coast faces the western tip of the Okinawa Trough, the back-arc basin of the Ryukyu subduction zone. In this study, we analyzed the present-day surface deformation of the Ilan Plain, aiming at deciphering its relationships with basement faults and the regional geodynamic setting. Our approach is mainly based on surface vertical displacements revealed by Persistent Scatterer Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (PSI), which indicate that there is an area of active subsidence (similar to 18 mm/yr) located in the southern part of the plain in probable connection with active basement faults and in agreement with previous geodetic measurements and existing geophysical data. Our PSI results also suggest that the subsidence occurring in the flan Plain has moved from north to south during Quaternary in relation with extrusion of the belt due to the westward propagation of the Okinawa Trough through the Taiwan Mountains.

2015.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Statistical analysis of earthquakes after the 1999 Mw 77 ChiChi Taiwan earthquake based on a modified ReasenbergJones model,Chen Y;Huang C;Liu J,"We investigated the temporal-spatial hazard of the earthquakes after the 1999 September 21 M-w = 7.7 Chi-Chi shock in a continental region of Taiwan. The Reasenberg-Jones (RJ) model (Reasenberg and Jones, 1989, 1994) that combines the frequency-magnitude distribution (Gutenberg and Richter, 1944) and time-decaying occurrence rate (Utsu et al., 1995) is conventionally employed for assessing the earthquake hazard after a large shock. However, it is found that the b values in the frequency-magnitude distribution of the earthquakes in the study region dramatically decreased from background values after the Chi-Chi shock, and then gradually increased up. The observation of a time-dependent frequencymagnitude distribution motivated us to propose a modified RJ model (MRJ) to assess the earthquake hazard. To see how the models perform on assessing short-term earthquake hazard, the RJ and MRJ models were separately used to sequentially forecast earthquakes in the study region. To depict the potential rupture area for future earthquakes, we further constructed relative hazard (RH) maps based on the two models. The Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves (Swets, 1988) finally demonstrated that the RH map based on the MRJ model was, in general, superior to the one based on the original RJ model for exploring the spatial hazard of earthquakes in a short time after the Chi-Chi shock.

A median-based method together with the z test is employed to examine the TEC variations 30 days before and after the earthquake. It is found that the TEC significantly decreases 0600-1000 LT 1-6 days before the earthquake, and anomalously increases in 3 time periods of 1300-1700 LT 12-15 days; 0000-0500 LT 15-17 days; and 0500-0900 LT 22-28 days before the earthquake. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is then used to evaluate the efficiency of TEC for predicting M 6.0 earthquakes in China during a specified time period. Statistical results suggest that the SIP is the significant TEC reduction in the morning period of 0600-1000 LT.

If the S-wave velocity of the Tertiary Basement is assumed to be 1000 m/s, then the Quaternary alluvial thicknesses in the Taipei Basin are between about 100 m and 650 m. The thickness of the alluvium gradually increases from the southeast to the northwest. The inversion results are also in good agreement with well-logging data and seismic reflection studies of the Taipei Basin. The study concludes that microtremor array measurement is a useful tool for estimating S-wave velocity structure. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

2015.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Temporal variation of gamma rays as a possible precursor of earthquake in the Longitudinal Valley of eastern Taiwan,Fu C;Wang P;Lee L;Lin C;Chang W;Giuliani G;Ouzounov D,"A gamma-ray station has been established recently along the Longitudinal Valley in eastern Taiwan, which is a suture zone with NNE-striking on the boundary between Eurasia plate and Philippine Sea plate. Stresses arise in the crust in accordance with crustal deformations due to plate motions and geodynamic processes. Gamma-ray emission associated with the radioactive decay of radon, which is discharged into surface from deep source area, is continuously recorded in the station. Fluctuations of gamma-ray data are found to show a clear inverse correlation with atmospheric temperature. Based on the linear regression method, possible temperature effects can be removed and the corrected data can be obtained. Anomalous variations in the gamma-ray counting rate may appear as precursors a few days before some local earthquakes in eastern Taiwan. It is noted that there are two significant increases in the gamma-ray counting rate during the periods from March 20 to 26 and from April 22 to May 1, 2014. These increases are observed about one week before two earthquake swarms from March 26 to 27 and from May 3 to 5, 2014. Furthermore, a progressive anomaly with a continuous increase (similar to 8%) in gamma-ray count was recorded two weeks before the Fanglin Earthquake (M-L = 5.9, May 21, 2014) occurring in the Longitudinal Valley area. A continuous monitoring on the gamma-ray data can improve our understanding of the possible relationship between the observed gamma-ray variations and the earthquakes in the study area.

2015.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Testing the uncertainty of diffuse reflectance spectroscopy methods for estimating marine sediment components by fullresolution spectrophotometry and principle component analyses,Pan H;Yu P;Chen M,"Estimating terrestrial and biogenic component variations in marine sediment cores provide essential information in paleoceanographic studies. The variations of terrestrial and biogenic components can be used to infer the changes of sediment provenances that are important for understanding what processes have governed the sediment compositional changes in the cores. One non-destructive technique, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), is now commonly used to capture high-resolution information on sediment component changes. The DRS method is a quick and cost-effective procedure for sediment core analysis that requires no chemical analysis with complicated procedures. Recently, one DRS device for capturing visible (VIS) color reflectance data (CRD) (400-700 nm) from core surfaces, the Minolta CM-2600d, has become a standard tool in all marine sediment core analysis. However, by capturing the visible wavelength of CRD only, there are uncertainties in the CRD near the ultraviolet (UV) and near-infrared (NIR) obtained by Minolta CM-2600d are poorly known. In this study, we used a full-resolution (FR) DRS device, the Analytical Spectral Device (ASD) LabSpec((R)) Pro FR ultraviolet! visible! near-infrared (UV/VIS/NIR) spectrometer (250-2500 nm) to compare with the CRD obtained from the Minolta CM-2600d, using the marine sediment core MD103264 taken from offshore southwestern Taiwan. We compared the differences in the VIS wavelength range of CRD between the two devices by analyzing the derivatives and a VARIMAX-rotated Principle Components Analysis (VPCA) of the CRD from 420 samples from core MD103264. Our results show significant uncertainties in CRD near the wavelengths of 400-450 and 650-700 nm in the data from the Minolta CM-2600d. These uncertainties could result in biased or erroneous estimates for terrestrial and biogenic components of marine sediment cores. Our experiments indicate that the CRD obtained with any device with VIS wavelength range only should be interpreted with caution, particularly in the 400-450 and 650-700 nm range.

2015.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,The first highresolution stalagmite record from Taiwan Climate and environmental changes during the past 1300 years,Li H;Zhao M;Tsai C;Mii H;Chang Q;Wei K,"This paper presents the first high-resolution Holocene stalagmite record of Taiwan from Jianfei Cave (22 degrees 50.873 N; 120 degrees 21.255 E) in Dagangshan Mountain, South Taiwan. The 13.6-cm long stalagmite (DGS-1) has been dated by AMS C-14 dating, spanning from AD 700 to AD 1933. The delta(18) O, delta C-13 and XRF scanned elemental profiles reveal interannual variations in climate and environmental conditions, with light delta O-18 and delta C-13 excursions reflecting wet climate and better vegetation coverage under stronger East Asia Summer Monsoon (EASM). Dark layers in DGS-1 containing high Fe, Mn and Sr contents were formed during dry episodes. Five periods with different climate regimes and vegetation conditions can be identified in the DGS-1 record: Period I (AD 700-1200) and Period V (AD 1810-1933) had warm and wet climates with good vegetation coverage. A drying trend probably corresponding to the switch from El Nino-like to La Nina-like oceanic condition occurred during Period II (AD 1200-1400). Cold but relatively wet climates with good vegetation coverage were prevailed during Period III (AD 1400-1610), whereas cold and dry climates with poor vegetation coverage were dominated during Period IV (AD 16101810). Based on the rainfall record of Tainan since AD 1897 and the stalagmite record, we found that stronger total solar irradiation (TSI) resulting in strong EASM produces heavy rainfall in South Taiwan on interannual-to-decadal scales; and vice versa. The 117-yr instrumental rainfall record of Tainan showed that rainfall in Tainan decreased during April-to-June and strongly increased during July-to-September in many La Nina years (positive SOI and negative Nino 3.4). This may be because weaker Meiyu rainfall but stronger tropical Equatorial Pacific cyclones (or typhoon) under La Nina condition. Thus, it is better to use seasonal rainfall for detecting relationship between Tainan rainfall and ENSO. On decadal-to-centennial scales, strong El Nino-like state and warm Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) phase are in favor of wet conditions in South Taiwan. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

2015.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,The linkage between longitudinal sediment routing systems and basin types in the northern South China Sea in perspective of sourcetosink,Su M;Hsiung K;Zhang C;Xie X;Yu H;Wang Z,"Using bathymetric and seismic data, this study describes the morpho-sedimentary features in Qiongdongnan basin and southwest Taiwan collision basin, northern South China Sea and reveals the linkages between sediment routing system and basin types. The modern Central Canyon in the Qiongdongnan basin is located along the rift margin, and subparallel to the shelf-break southeast of Hainan Island. The modern Central Canyon develops along the basin axis (i.e., Xisha Trough) and longitudinally transports sediments eastward which are mainly supplied by northern continental slope. The Penghu Canyon in the southwest Taiwan collision basin is located along the collision boundary parallel to the strike of the adjacent uplifted Taiwan orogen. The Penghu Canyon develops along the tilting basin axis transporting sediments longitudinally southward to the deep-sea basin and Manila Trench. The Penghu Canyon is supplied with sediments from both flank Kaoping and South China Sea slopes where tributary canyons and channels transport sediments down-slope and feed the axial canyon. The certain basin types may be occupied by particular styles of sediment routing system. By comparing the morpho-sedimentary features and basin characteristics associated with the modern Central Canyon to that of the Valencia Channel in NW Mediterranean Sea, the longitudinal sediment routing system in rift basin type can be determined. In contrast, the longitudinal sediment routing systems in collision setting can be represented by the comparable examples of Penghu Canyon in southwest Taiwan collision basin and Markham Canyon in western Solomon Sea. The rift type sediment routing system is characterized by an axial canyon with a single sediment supply from land drainage margin. In contrast, sediment routing system in collision type basins consists of an axial canyon and dual sediment supplies from flank adjacent slopes. The axial canyons in collision basins are more active than that of the rift basin due to abundant sediment supply and active tectonics. The results demonstrate the role of longitudinal sediment transport in delivering terrestrial sediments for a long distance from land drainages (source) to far-field deep-sea basin (sink). This study has implication for better understanding of the linkages between basin mechanics, sediment routing systems and sedimentary processes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

2015.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,The seismogenic deformation and Qp temporal variation before the M62 Mingjen earthquake Taiwan,Wen S;Chen C;Ji Y;Chang Y;Chen C,"Detecting anomalies before an earthquake has become an important task in seismic hazard prevention. The purpose of this research is to use the intrinsic attenuative dispersion of the P-wave, Qp, to serve as an anomaly before an earthquake. On November 5, 2009, an earthquake (M-L = 6.2; depth = 24 km) occurred in Ming-Jen, Nantou county, Taiwan. The vertical-component of the first-cycle of P-wave data recorded from the Central Weather Bureau Seismic Network from 2009/01 to 2010/01 was calculated to obtain the Qp parameter. Meanwhile, this study also utilizes global positioning system stations to examine changes in surface displacements that occurred during the Mingjen earthquake. Analysis results indicate that 2-months before the mainshock occurred; the Qp began to decrease for all stations, which implies that the crustal area became more fractured owing to a high stress accumulation. Such a lead time of 2 months is equal to the average lead time of Seismic Electric Signals (SES) activities being also compatible with a physical model suggested long ago for the SES generation. With stress accumulating a few days before the earthquake, an impeded region can be clearly identified by relatively-large difference values when the mainshock is going to occur. We conclude that the analysis of the Qp parameter and GPS index are very sensitive to changes in the stress state and may serve as a useful index in early warning of earthquake.

2015.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,The Tienchi Pond on Lanyu Island Western Pacific Lake formation and potential as environmental archive,Lowemark L;Chen T;Gunnarson B;Su C;Yang T;Huang J;Lan Y;Burr G,"The formation, evolution, and potential as a climate archive of Tienchi Pond was evaluated using geomor-phology, sedimentology, geochemistry, and AMS radiocarbon measurements of tree ring cores. Tienchi Pond is a small ephemeral lake situated on the subtropical Lanyu Island in the Western Pacific Ocean about 90 km east of southern Taiwan. The lake is situated on a mountain ridge and is today characterized by numerous dead trees and stumps. The position at the boundary between the two main components of the SE Asian monsoon system, the Asian landmass and the Western Pacific, makes this lake particularly interesting as a potential natural climate archive. Since previous studies have shown that the bedrock underlying the lake formed over 2 my ago, a volcanic crater origin was ruled out. Rather, element ratios of K/Ti and Ca/Fe together with Pb-210 dating suggest a recent origin for the lake, probably as the result of a natural damming event in the southern, narrower, part of the lake basin, or as a result of increased precipitation at the end of the Little Ice Age (or a combination of both). Radiocarbon measurements on a dead tree near the lake perimeter show C-14 levels of more than 1.7% modern radiocarbon near the bark, suggesting that the tree died in the early 1970s. In contrast, by correlating a large number of radiocarbon measurements to a northern hemisphere reference curve, it was shown that trees closer to the center of the lake died in the early 20th century. This agrees with a scenario where a small lake formed by initial damming, and gradually grew larger through erosion of the surrounding shore lines caused by rapid lake level oscillations.

2015.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Very shortterm earthquake precursors from GPS signal interference based on the 2013 Nantou and Rueisuei earthquakes Taiwan,Yeh Y;Cheng K;Wang W;Yu S,"We set up a GPS network with 17 Continuous GPS (CGPS) stations in southwestern Taiwan to monitor real-time crustal deformation. We found that systematic perturbations in GPS signals occurred just a few minutes prior to the 2013 Nantou (M-L = 6.5) and Rueisuei (M-L = 6.4) earthquakes in Taiwan. The anomalous pseudorange readings were several millimeters higher or lower than those in the background time period. These systematic anomalies were found as a result of interference of GPS L-band signals by electromagnetic emissions (EMS) prior to the mainshocks. The EMs may occur in the form of harmonic or ultra-wide-band radiation and can be generated during the formation of Mode I cracks at the final stage of earthquake nucleation. We estimated the directivity of the likely EM sources by calculating the inner product of the position vector from a GPS station to a given satellite and the vector of anomalous ground motions recorded by the GPS. The results showed that the predominant inner product generally occurred when the satellite was in the direction either toward or away from the epicenter with respect to the GPS network. Our findings suggest that the GPS network may serve as a powerful tool to detect very shortterm earthquake precursors and presumably to locate a large earthquake before it occurs. Nevertheless, a direct measurement of EMs at the site of the GPS array is required in future studies to confirm this hypothesis. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

2016.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Coulomb stress changes and seismicity in central Taiwan due to the Nantou blindthrust earthquakes in 2013,Liao B;Huang H,"Due to the two earthquakes, 27 March 2013 event (M(L)6.2, namely 0327 event) and 2 June 2013 event (M(L)6.5, namely 0602 event), occurring at the Nantou area of the central Taiwan, we investigate the relationship between the Coulomb stress changes and the seismicity in the paper. We first employed the refined homomorphic deconvolution method to invert the kinematic source processes of these two earthquakes from the teleseismic data recorded by Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS), and then calculated the Coulomb stress changes of these two events. The total durations of the rupture process for the 0327 and 0602 events were 12 s and 15 s, respectively. The epicenter of the 0602 event and the epicenters of the aftershocks (M-L > 3) of the 0327 event were concentrated in a region with positive Coulomb stresses caused by the 0327 event. This indicates that the derived source process was available and coincided with physical properties in a manner that strongly suggests that the 0602 event was triggered by the 0327 event. According to the Coulomb stress changes caused by the 0602 event at a depth of 4 km and its vertical cross section, most of the aftershocks (M-L > 3) of the 0602 event were located in a region with positive Coulomb stress changes greater than 0.1 bar. In addition, almost all the epicenters of the earthquakes (M-L > 3) in central Taiwan between July 15, 2013, and January 27, 2015, were located in a region with positive Coulomb stress changes at a depth of 6 km contributed by the 0327 and 0602 events. These findings indicate that if the background stress in the central Taiwan is intense high, the Coulomb stress changes contributed by the two events may affect the seismicity of central Taiwan in this period of time, and that a region with extreme positive Coulomb stress changes may be the place in which potential earthquakes will occur in the future. Moreover, the proposed inversion method can derive the proper source model efficiently without any statistical assumptions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

2016.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Probable slow slips in the midcrust of Hsinchu northwestern Taiwan Temporal correlation between normal faulting earthquakes and relative uplift,Pu H;Lin C,"To investigate the seismic behavior of crustal deformation, we deployed a dense seismic network at the Hsinchu area of northwestern Taiwan during the period between 2004 and 2006. Based on abundant local micro-earthquakes recorded at this seismic network, we have successfully determined 274 focal mechanisms among 1300 seismic events. It is very interesting to see that the dominant energy of both seismic strike-slip and normal faulting mechanisms repeatedly alternated with each other within two years. Also, the strike-slip and normal faulting earthquakes were largely accompanied with the surface slipping along N60 degrees E and uplifting obtained from the continuous GPS data, individually. Those phenomena were probably resulted by the slow uplifts at the mid-crust beneath the northwestern Taiwan area. As the deep slow uplift was active below 10 km in depth along either the boundary fault or blind fault, the push of the uplifting material would simultaneously produce both of the normal faulting earthquakes in the shallow depths (0-10 km) and the slight surface uplifting. As the deep slow uplift was stop, instead, the strike-slip faulting earthquakes would be dominated as usual due to strongly horizontal plate convergence in the Taiwan. Since the normal faulting earthquakes repeatedly dominated in every 6 or 7 months between 2004 and 2006, it may conclude that slow slip events in the mid crust were frequent to release accumulated tectonic stress in the Hsinchu area.

2016.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Siteeffect estimations for Taipei Basin based on shallow Swave velocity structures,Chen Y;Huang H;Wu C,"Shallow S-wave velocities have been widely used for earthquake ground-motion site characterization. Thus, the S-wave velocity structures of Taipei Basin, Taiwan were investigated using array records of microtremors at 15 sites (Huang et al., 2015). In this study, seven velocity structures are added to the database describing Taipei Basin. Validity of S-wave velocity structures are first examined using the 1D Haskell method and well-logging data at the Wuku Sewage Disposal Plant (WK) borehole site. Basically, the synthetic results match well with the observed data at different depths. Based on S-wave velocity structures at 22 sites, theoretical transfer functions at five different formations of the sedimentary basin are calculated. According to these results, predominant frequencies for these formations are estimated. If the S-wave velocity of the Tertiary basement is assumed to be 1000 m/s, the predominant frequencies of the Quaternary sediments are between 0.3 Hz (WUK) and 1.4 Hz (LEL) in Taipei Basin while the depths of sediments between 0 m (i.e. at the edge of the basin) and 616 m (i.e. site WUK) gradually increase from southeast to northwest.

2016.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Swave velocity structure and site effect parameters derived from microtremor arrays in the Western Plain of Taiwan,Kuo C;Chen C;Lin C;Wen K;Huang J;Chang S,"In this study, microtremor array measurements were conducted at 45 sites in the Western Plain of Taiwan. The arrays were approximately 30 m or 60 m in radius, depending on the site. The maximum likelihood frequency-wavenumber method was adopted to obtain the phase velocities of Rayleigh waves, and then a genetic algorithm technique based on an inversion scheme of the fundamental mode of the Rayleigh waves' dispersion curves was applied to calculate a preliminary S-wave velocity (Vs) profile at each site. Because a layer of thick sediment covers the bedrock in the Western Plain of Taiwan, micro tremor arrays in this size range cannot estimate the structure of the entire sediment. Therefore, this study implemented further inversion of the horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratios of the microtremors to estimate the deeper structures up to the bedrock of Vs greater than 1000 m/s. Previously logged velocity profiles for different depths at or near our study sites were collected and compared with the Vs profiles derived from our microtremor array measurements; the results were found to be highly comparable. Therefore, we could delineate the depth distributions for the layer depths for Vs = 600 m/s and 1000 m/s in this region. The depth for Vs = 600 m/s is approximately 50 m in the piedmont area and approximately 300 m at the coastline; moreover, the depths for Vs = 1000 m/s increase from 200 m in the piedmont area to approximately 1000 m at the coastline. The depths for Vs = 1.0 km/s (Z1.0), which is an important parameter that accounts for the basin effect in recent ground motion prediction equations, are consequently available at the study sites. The distribution of Z1.0 as a function of Vs30 indicates higher similarity to that in Japan than in the San Francisco Bay area. (C) 2016 The Author(s).

2016.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,The epilog of the western paleoPacific subduction Inferred from spatial and temporal variations and geochemistry of the Late Cretaceous to Early Cenozoic silicic magmatism in coastal South China,Chen C;Lee C;Shinjo R,"The Late Cretaceous to Early Cenozoic magmatism in the South China coastal area produced some amounts of rhyolitic rocks in two phases, which may be used to unravel the geohistory of the epilog of the paleo-Pacific plate subduction system. Essence of the Phase I rocks is the high temperature rhyolite (A-type)-trachydacite association in north Fujian (95-91 Ma) that was coeval with regional A-type granites. They succeeded the vast rhyolite-dacite-andesite (RDA) associations and I-type granitoids (113.5-96 Ma) and preceded the silicic-dominating rhyolite/basalt bimodal suites or monolithologic rhyolite in Zhejiang (89-86 Ma). Phase II rocks include (a) the RDA association or rhyolite alone in some drifted continental fragments nearby (83-56 Ma) and (b) the following rift-basin related rhyolite-tra chyte/basalt bimodal suites in Guangdong and west Taiwan (56-38 Ma). The silicic volcanism, spatially changed from a NE-SW to the nearly E-W direction after 83 Ma, may reflect tectonic-driven eruptions occurred in the post-orogenic extensional (Phase I), resumed plate subducting (Phase Ha) and continental margin rifting (Phase IIb) stages. Rhyolitic rocks basically are shoshonitic to high-K calc-alkaline affinities while the Phase Ha RDA associations are mostly concentrated in the high-K to medium-K calc-alkaline series. All these rocks generally possess a continental arc character in tectonic discrimination diagrams, except shoshonitic rocks that have within-plate signatures. Based on the trace element and Nd-Pb isotope data, A-type rocks are suggested to have derived from mixing between trachydacitic (or syenitic) magmas and crustal melts of various sources under the high temperature condition (+/- metasomatism), and the succeeding silicic rocks are derivatives of the contaminated lithospheric mantle melts through crystal fractionation. On the other hand, Phase II silicic rocks are mainly the fractionation products of mafic magmas originated either from the lithospheric or the asthenospheric mantle. In reflection to such magmatotectonics with time, break-off of the subducted slab shortly before 113.5 Ma, change of the plate-moving direction between 86 and 83 Ma, and termination of plate movement probably at similar to 56 Ma signify the epilog of the paleo-Pacific plate.

2016.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Threedimensional density structures of Taiwan and tectonic implications based on the analysis of gravity data,Hsieh H;Yen H,"Taiwan is located in a collision and subduction area and has a complex tectonic history. To better understand the complicated structure beneath Taiwan, gravity studies, in addition to seismic and geological studies, provide useful geophysical information for studying shallow depths. Previous gravity studies of Taiwan in the last 30 years focused on local regionalized explanations and 2-D profile modeling. This study is the first to complete a 3-D gravity inversion of Taiwan, and it provides a more comprehensive and large-scale tectonic analysis. Following 3-D gravity inversion using the least squares method, we sliced horizontal and vertical profiles from the 3-D density model to visualize tectonic changes. The low Bouguer anomaly was caused by thick sediment and crust layers. The high-density layers are located in special tectonic areas such as the Peikang and Kuanying basement highs. The deepest Moho depth beneath the middle of the Central Range is 45-50 km. The high gradient changes of the eastern section of the Moho relief are shown by the complex mechanism of plate collision. The geometry of plate subduction is apparent in northeastern Taiwan, and the oceanic crust is observable under eastern Taiwan, showing arc-collision boundaries. Our 3-D density model, when combined with updated gravity data and seismic tomography, offers better resolution for deep structures than the previous 2-D forward results and serves as a physical property reference to better understand the tectonic structure beneath Taiwan.

2016.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Transition of the TaiwanRyukyu collisionsubduction process as revealed by oceanbottom seismometer observations,Chin S;Lin J;Chen Y;Wu W;Liang C,"Located at the arc-continental collision region between the Eurasian (EP) and Philippine Sea Plates (PSP), Taiwan is usually considered to have a complex tectonic environment, particularly along the eastern coast of the island. To gain a better understanding of the geological evolution of the east Taiwan area, the data from 8 Ocean Bottom Seismometers (OBS) acquired during the Across Taiwan Strait Explosion Experiment in 2012 and 14 inland seismic stations were used to determine a more detailed and accurate distribution of marine earthquakes. Based on the 333 relocated earthquakes and available geophysical data, we suggest two main tectonic boundaries for eastern Taiwan. South of 23.25 degrees N, the homogeneous distribution of earthquakes in the crustal portion for both the inland and offshore areas suggests an ongoing collisional process. North of this location, between approximately 23.25 degrees N and 23.8 degrees N, the abrupt increasing of seismicity depth infers that the underthrusted arc/fore-arc material is deforming due to the collisional compression at depth. In this segment, the subsidence of the arc/fore-arc area determines the transition from collision to subduction. North of 23.8 degrees N, the northwestern dipping PSP is well illustrated by the seismicity both onshore and offshore, indicating a dominant subduction process. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

2016.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Using stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes to reveal monsoonal and related hydrological effects on meteoric water in the Western Pacific monsoon region A case study of the Ilan region northeastern Taiwan,Peng T;Huang C;Chen C;Chen J;Liang W,"This study analyzes the isotopic compositions (delta H-2 and delta O-18) of meteoric waters, including precipitation and stream water, to reveal what major hydrological processes affect the hydrological regime of the Ilan region, northeastern Taiwan. The isotopic results indicate monsoonal flows as the fundamental factors affecting studied precipitation and stream water. Summer precipitation sourced from southerly air mass exhibits lower delta and deuterium-excess (d(E)) values than winter precipitation sourced from northerly air masses. The delta O-18 and d(E) values are respectively -7.7 parts per thousand and 8 parts per thousand for summer precipitation and -3.3 parts per thousand and 24 parts per thousand for winter precipitation. Furthermore, semi-quantitative estimations using d(E) evidence indicate that summertime southerly air masses generally contribute more to stream water than wintertime northerly air-mass flows (approximately 54% vs. 46%). However, the contribution fractions are controlled by the orientation of catchments to the windward side of respective monsoonal flows. Northern catchments, located on the windward side of southerly air masses, receive about 60% of their water from precipitation condensed from the southerly air masses, and 40% from the northerly air masses. By comparison, southern catchments, located on the windward side of northerly air masses, receive about 59% of their water from northerly air masses and 41% from southerly air masses. Additionally, catchment effect, induced from delta value, is notable in stream basins with high elevations but this is not related to catchment sizes. Besides this, altitude effect, which is determined in terms of delta O-18 values, was derived using data from four precipitation stations of northern Taiwan. It ranges from -2.5 to -3.0 parts per thousand per 100 m depending on the season; moreover, based on the d(E) evidence, secondary evaporation effects are apparent with moisture recycling influencing inland summer precipitation and raindrop evaporation influencing inland winter precipitation.

Its geological and tectonic setting provides a unique opportunity to study the time constraint of the break-up unconformity relevant to the opening of the South China Sea. A detailed foraminiferal study on four land sections and a deep core across the boundary between the Upper and Lower Wulai Groups in the Hsuehshan Range, northern Taiwan, was conducted. Results show remarkable changes of depositional environment and lithology from the amalgamated fluvial dominant sandstones (>2000 m) of Middle Eocene in the Lower Wulai Group to the overlying inner neritic shales and siltstones (>2000 m) of Oligocene in the Upper Wulai Group. Integrated sedimentological and foraminiferal data further suggest an occurrence of a depositional hiatus between 32 similar to 33 and 40 Ma across the boundary between the Kankou Formation of the Upper Wulai Group and the Szeleng Sandstone of the Lower Wulai Group in the northern Hsuehshan Range, as same as the scenario seen in the Western Foothills (25-39 Ma) of central Taiwan and the Penghu Basin (25-40 Ma) in the Taiwan Strait. This stratigraphic hiatus in the Taiwan mountain belt marks a regional break-up unconformity between the Middle Eocene syn-rift strata and the overlying Oligocene post-rift sequences in the NE South China Sea. The break-up unconformity can be correlated with those commonly recognized in the seismic profiles of the Pearl River Mouth Basin and drilling of the IODP site U1435 (Expedition 349) in the northern shelf-slope of the South China Sea. The upper time limit of the breakup unconformity 32 Ma could mark the tectonic change from rifting to depression in the Paleogene Asian continental margin which eventually led to opening of the deep South China Sea in the Early Oligocene (similar to 33 Ma).

2017.0,J.

Active gas bubble emissions at the flat crest of the mud volcano disperse sediment particles into the water column. Changes in the mud volcanism of TY1 were revealed by radiograph and grain size analysis of the sediment cores. Pb-210 geochronology was applied to the near-seafloor sediments to reveal the detailed mud volcanism from the deposition rate. In a 58-cm long sediment core taken from the northern margin of the crest, known as TY1-N.170, the size and frequency of the mud clasts decrease upward. The clasts are smaller than 8 mm above a sediment depth of 34 cm below the sea floor (cmbsf). Sediments between 0 and 19 cmbsf are massive, and particles larger than 2 mm are absent. An enrichment of coarse, silt-sized particles in the massive sediment unit and the restricted distribution of the unit suggest that the massive unit was generated by re deposition of sediment particles that were dispersed into the water column by gas bubble emission. These characteristics suggest that during the last mud volcanism of TY1, there was a decrease in mud eruption energy, and gas bubble emission became the main activity. In core TY1-S.440, taken from the southern slope, a massive sediment unit enriched with coarse, silt-sized particles, is intercalated between mud breccia structures. This suggests repeated mud breccia flows caused by TY1. The excess 21 Pb activity present in the massive sediment unit of TY1-N.170 suggests activation of gas bubble emission. In the massive unit, a decrease in excess Pb-210 activity appears upward toward the seafloor. The highest value is 3.1 dpm/g at 19.8 cmbsf (26.4 g/cm(2) in cumulative mass); values lower than 1.0 dpm/g are distributed 2.8-6.8 cmbsf (3.6-8.8 g/cm(2)). The upwardly decreasing trend is opposite that of the reference core from which a reasonable areal sedimentation rate was obtained using a constant-flux constant-sedimentation model. The anomalous depth profile at the massive unit indicates an increasing rate of sediment deposition, which originated from the activation of gas bubble emission.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.;  Minist Econ Affairs, Cent Geol Survey, Taipei 23568, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,JAPAN,13,1.0,,"Hiruta, A (corresponding author), Meiji Univ, Gas Hydrate Lab, OSRI, Tokyo 1010062, Japan.","National Science Council of TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [NSC-100-3113-M-002-001-, NSC-101-2116-M-002-002-, NSC-101-3113-P-002-013-, NSC-102-3113-P-002-005-]","The authors thank the captain and crew of the R/V Ocean Researcher III and the scientific parties of the OR3-1621 and OR3-1643 cruises.

2017.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,An empirical evolutionary magnitude estimation for early warning of earthquakes,Chen D;Wu Y;Chin T,"The earthquake early warning (EEW) system is difficult to provide consistent magnitude estimate in the early stage of an earthquake occurrence because only few stations are triggered and few seismic signals are recorded. One of the feasible methods to measure the size of earthquakes is to extract amplitude parameters using the initial portion of the recorded waveforms after P-wave arrival. However, for a large-magnitude earthquake (M-W > 7.0), the time to complete the whole ruptures resulted from the corresponding fault may be very long. The magnitude estimations may not be correctly predicted by the initial portion of the seismograms. To estimate the magnitude of a large earthquake in real-time, the amplitude parameters should be updated with ongoing waveforms instead of adopting amplitude contents in a predefined fixed-length time window, since it may underestimate magnitude for large magnitude events. In this paper, we propose a fast, robust and less-saturated approach to estimate earthquake magnitudes. The EEW system will initially give a lower-bound of the magnitude in a time window with a few seconds and then update magnitude with less saturation by extending the time window. Here we compared two kinds of time windows for measuring amplitudes. One is P-wave time window (PTW) after P-wave arrival; the other is whole-wave time window after P-wave arrival (WTW), which may include both P and S wave. One to ten second time windows for both PTW and WTW are considered to measure the peak ground displacement from the vertical component of the waveforms. Linear regression analysis are run at each time step (1-to 10-s time interval) to find the empirical relationships among peak ground displacement, hypocentral distances, and magnitudes using the earthquake records from 1993 to 2012 in Taiwan with magnitude greater than 5.5 and focal depth less than 30 km. The result shows that considering WTW to estimate magnitudes has smaller standard deviation than PTW. The magnitude estimations using 1-s time widow have larger uncertainties.

2017.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Assesment of the response of the meteorologicalhydrological parameters on the soil gas radon emission at Hsinchu northern Taiwan A prerequisite to identify earthquake precursors,Arora B;Kumar A;Walia V;Yang T;Fu C;Liu T;Wen K;Chen C,"The present study is an attempt to assess and quantify the influence of the meteorological (atmospheric temperature and pressure) and hydrological (rainfall and ground water head-GWH) parameters on the soil gas radon emission at Hsinchu, northern Taiwan. The quasi-periodic variations corresponding to diurnal and semi diurnal periods were estimated and eliminated by decomposing the time series for the period of September 16, 2009 to March 5, 2010 to singular spectrum analysis. The reconstructed non-periodic variations, which reproduce the salient feature of recorded time series, were searched for meteorological/hydrological influences in radon emission. The combined response of barometric pressure and atmosphere temperature are found to be small when compared to the total variability in radon. The influence of rainfall on radon is found to be strongest. At the onset of rainfall, radon shows a step-jump that attains peak with a time lag of 12-15 h. This enhancement is attributed to entrapment of soil gas in the top soil cover as increased soil moisture prevents escape of radon into the atmosphere (capping effect). The decay of radon after the recession of rainfall is approximated by double exponential decay terms, one corresponding to the natural decay of radon with half life of 3.84 days and second representing slow weakening of capping effect. The third effect related to internal loading due to rise and fall of groundwater modulates the propagation of radon in overlying strata, accounting for the long term variations in radon. The rainfall inflicted changes in radon look strikingly similar to earthquake related precursory or co-seismic perturbations, inferred by long term synotopic observations. It is surmised that unless radon variations are corrected for meteorological/hydrological contamination, some precursory signals are masked on one hand while on the other hand some anomalies are falsely viewed as earthquake precursors.","NCREE, NARL, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Natl Cent Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Jhongli, Taiwan.;  Natl Cent Univ, Inst Geophys, Jhongli, Taiwan.;  Uttarakhand State Council Sci & Technol, Via Prernnagar, Dehra Dun 248007, Uttar Pradesh, India.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;INDIA,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,8,1.0,1.0,"Walia, V (corresponding author), NCREE, NARL, Taipei, Taiwan.","Central Geological Survey of Taiwan (CGS); Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) of TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [NSC 100-2811-M-492-006, NSC 100-2116-M-492-002, NSC 100-2811-M-492-005]; NARL","The authors dedicate the present paper to Prof. Tsanyao Frank Yang, the founder of geochemical earthquake precursory research in Taiwan, who left for his heavenly abode in midst of the present study.

Net DIC flux changes (Delta(DIC-Prod)) were applied to determine the proportion of sulfate consumption by organic matter oxidation (heterotrophic sulfate reduction) and anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM), and to determine reliable CH4 fluxes at the SMTZ. Our results show that SO42- profiles are mainly controlled by AOM rather than heterotrophic sulfate reduction. Refinement of CH4 flux estimates enhance our understanding of methane abundance from deep carbon reservoirs to the SMTZ. Concentrations of chloride (Cl-), bromide (Br-) and iodide (I-) dissolved in pore water were used to identify potential sources that control fluid compositions and the behavior of dissolved ions. Constant Cl- concentrations throughout similar to 30 m sediment suggest no influence of gas hydrates for the compositions within the core. Bromide (Br-) and Iodine (I-) concentrations increase with sediment depth. The I-/Br- ratio appears to reflect organic matter degradation. SO42- concentrations decrease with sediment depth at a constant rate, and sediment depth profiles of Br- and I- concentrations suggests diffusion as the main transport mechanism. Therefore diffusive flux calculations are reasonable. Coring sites with high CH4 fluxes are more common in the accretionary wedge, amongst thrust faults and fractures, than in the passive continental margin offshore southwestern Taiwan. AOM reactions are a major sink for CH4 passing upward through the SMTZ and prevent high methane fluxes in the water column and to the atmosphere.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei, Taiwan.;  CPC Corp, Explorat & Prod Business Div, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.;  Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Oceanog, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.;  Univ Bremen, Ctr Marine Environm Sci, MARUM, Bremen, Germany.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, Taipei, Taiwan.;  MOEA, Cent Geol Survey, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;GERMANY;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,GERMANY,13,1.0,,"Chuang, PC (corresponding author), Univ Bremen, Ctr Marine Environm Sci, MARUM, Bremen, Germany.","Central Geological Survey of Taiwan, R.O.C.

2017.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Coseismic deformation of the 2016 Taiwan Mw63 earthquake using InSAR data and source slip inversion,Qu C;Zuo R;Shan X;Hu J;Zhang G,"An earthquake of seismic moment magnitude (Mw)6.3 occurred in southern Taiwan on February 6th, 2016. In this paper, we use differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (D-InSAR) technology and data from the Sentinel-1A(S-1A)/IW radar satellite to estimate the coseismic deformation of this event. On the basis of ascending data, InSAR analysis reveals a circle-like uplift area, 45 km in diameter, 20 km northwest of the epicenter, that has a maximum line of sight (LOS) displacement of 12 cm. South and east of this uplift area, minor subsidence occurred, while descending data indicated uplift in the west and sink in the east, with maximum values of 8.0 cm and 6.0 cm, respectively. Displacements are continuously distributed across the entire deformed region, implying that the seismogenic fault did not pierce the Earth's surface. Based on these InSAR displacements coupled with GPS observations, we inverted the distribution of source slip using an elastic half-space fault model both separately and jointly. Four kinds of inversion results consistently show a slip concentration to the northwest of the epicenter, with maximum slip in the range 0.35-0.55 m confined to depths of 6-15 km in the crust. The source fault is dominated by thrust with left-lateral strike slip; joint inversion using InSAR ascending and. descending data, as well as GPS data, resulted in maximum slip of 0.44 m, within the range determined by separate inversions. Inversion results show that this was a Mw6.25 earthquake, consistent with measurements collected by the United States Geological Survey (USGS).","China Earthquake Adm, Inst Geol, State Key Lab Earthquake Dynam, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei, Taiwan.;",CHINA;TAIWAN,CHINA,CHINA,5,2.0,2.0,"Qu, CY (corresponding author), China Earthquake Adm, Inst Geol, Huayanli Jia 1, Beijing, Peoples R China.","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41374015, 41461164002]; National Key Laboratory of Earthquake Dynamics [LED2015A03, LED2013A02]","We thank the ESA for providing us with S-1A data free of charge, Wang Rongjiang for access to the SBIF program, and Professor Wen Xueze for beneficial discussions on the nature of fault movement.

2017.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Crustal structure north of the Taiping Island Itu Aba Island southern margin of the South China Sea,Chang J;Hsieh H;Mirza A;Chang S;Hsu H;Liu C;Su C;Chiu S;Ma Y;Chiu Y;Hung H;Lin Y;Chiu C,"Based on the multi-channel seismic (MCS) and gravity data offshore north of Taiping Island (Itu Aba Island) in the Spratly Islands (Nansha Islands), we revisited the crustal structures in the northern part of the southern margin of the Southwest (SW) Sub-basin of the South China Sea (SCS). The MCS data suggest that the basement structural highs in the southwest margin of the SCS are dominated by both fault blocks and volcanic basement structures that probably formed along with the basement faults. The gravity modeling results reveal that these volcanic basement structures were probably associated with the high velocity or density lower crust (HVDLC), suggesting that the southern margin of the SW Sub basin serves as an intermediate margin. Based on the tectonic features in the SCS margins, including (1) the transition between the magma-poor margins of the Northwest (NW) Sub-basin and intermediate margins of the East and SW Sub-basins; (2) the cessation of the seafloor spreading in the NW Sub-basin being succeeded by a major ridge jump event, which was very likely to reflect an active mantle upwelling event; (3) the extensive distribution of the HVDLC beneath in the well-investigated northern margin of the East Sub-basin and as explored in the SW Sub-basin in this study; and (4) basement faulting and volcanism shown in this study that may be related to the HVDLC and hyper-extension, we proposed a conceptual model to interpret the origin of the HVDLC in the southern margin of the SW Sub-basin. The margin of the SCS basin was magma-poor at the time it occurred. An active mantle upwelling event caused by small-scale mantle convection, possibly related to the influence of the nascent Hainan mantle plume, was formed subsequently, resulting in a southward ridge jump and the HVDLC beneath the current margins of the East and SW Sub-basins. The East and SW Sub-basins continued to spread, latitudinally dividing their HVDLCs as the margins separated accordingly. Afterwards, the hyper-extension in the distal margins may also be responsible for a crust weakening zone wherein the subsequent volcanic events could occur. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

2017.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Determination of fault planes and dimensions for lowmagnitude earthquakes A case study in eastern Taiwan,Mozziconacci L;Delouis B;Huang B,"We present a modified version of the FMNEAR method for determining the focal mechanisms and fault plane geometries of small earthquakes. Our improvements allow determination of the fault plane and dimensions using the near-field components of only a few local records. The limiting factor is the number of stations: a minimum of five to six stations is required to discriminate between the fault plane and auxiliary plane. This limitation corresponds to events with magnitudes M-L, > 3.5 in eastern Taiwan, but strongly depends on station coverage in the study area. Once a fault plane is identified, it is provided along with its source time function and fault slip distribution. The proposed approach is validated by synthetic tests, and applied to real cases from a seismic crisis that occurred in the Longitudinal Valley of eastern Taiwan in April 2006. The fault geometries and faulting types of test events closely match the fault system of the main shock and reveal a minor one inside the faults zone of the Longitudinal Valley. Tested on a larger scale, this approach enables the fault geometries of Main and secondary fault systems to be recovered from small earthquakes, allowing subsurface faults to be mapped in detail without waiting for a large, damaging event.

2017.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Diapiric activities and intraslope basin development offshore of SW Taiwan A case study of the Lower Fangliao Basin gas hydrate prospect,Hsu H;Liu C;Chang Y;Chang J;Ko C;Chiu S;Chen S,"The architecture and distribution of mud diapirs are shaped by tectonic activity, sediment filling and unbalanced loading characteristics. Mud diapir development also controls spatial variations of intraslope basins in slope areas and can spur upward fluid migration with diapiric intrusion. The offshore area of southwestern Taiwan is an incipient collision zone in which thick sequences of deep marine sediments filled a rapidly subsided foredeep basin during the Pliocene. Large volumes of deposited sediment serve as source materials of diapiric ridges that extend NNE-SSW, and some mud diapirs even extend to on land SW Taiwan with subsurface signatures of gas. This study examines relationships between mud diapir and intraslope basin development in convergent tectonics through seismic and bathymetry data analyses. Four types of mud diapirs are identified: (1) buried symmetrical diapirs; (2) symmetrical diapirs extruded above the seafloor; (3) asymmetric and irregular diapirs; and (4) small individual diapirs manifested as mud intrusions found in local areas. A 3-stage model is proposed as a tool for describing the development and distribution of these types of diapirs. We further examine the relationship between mud diapirs and intraslope basin development patterns by analyzing 2D and 3D seismic images to reveal structural and sedimentary processes occurring in the Lower Fangliao Basin. This basin is characterized by BSR and amplitude anomalies of seismic profiles and is a prospect of the Taiwanese gas hydrate investigation project. An 8-stage development model with six depositional units is proposed as a means to explain the evolution of diapirs, submarine canyons, and fold and fault activities in the Lower Fangliao Basin, in turn revealing the relationship between mud diapir formation and intraslope basin development offshore of southwestern Taiwan.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Natl Oceanog Ctr, Southampton, Hants, England.;  CPC Corp, Miaoli, Taiwan.;  Minist Econ Affairs, Cent Geol Survey, Taipei, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;UNITED KINGDOM;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,7,1.0,,"Liu, CS (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, Taipei, Taiwan.","Central Geological Survey, Ministry of Economic Affairs; Taiwan Ministry of Science and Technology [104-2917-I-564-056]","The authors acknowledge assistance received from Chih-Chieh Su and from members of the Seismic Exploration Laboratory, Institute of Oceanography, NTU.

Asian Earth Sci.,Geological implications of the 0212 earthquake in 2014 at the Tatun Volcano Group of Taiwan Synergistic effects of volcanic and faulting activities,Pu H;Lin C;Chang L;Kan C;Lin C;Li Y;Lai Y;Shih M,"On February 12, 2014, an M-L 4.2 earthquake (named 0212 EQ) occurred at the Tatun Volcano Group (TVG) in northern Taiwan. Seismic data from both the regional broadband array in Taiwan and a local dense seismic network in the TVG indicate that the 0212 EQ was located at a depth of 4.3 km near Shamoshan, one of the latest eruptive units in the TVG. Referring to the aftershocks surrounding the 0212 EQ, we further found that (1) they formed a linear seismic zone dipping similar to 50 degrees towards the southeast to reach the Shanchiao Fault that cuts through the TVG, (2) focal mechanism of more than half of the larger aftershocks (M-D >= 1.5) matched this linear seismic zone for a normal faulting, and (3) the seismic b value was calculated to be 3.55. They are used to delineate the geometry of the Shanchiao Fault at the upper crust and to infer that localized geothermal fluid might have affected the activity of aftershocks as manifested by the very high seismic b-value. The strongly compensated linear vector dipole of the centroid moment tensor suggests the 0212 EQ had a non-double-couple source resulted from the gravitational collapse. Thus, we conclude that the 0212 EQ was a combined synergistic effect of a collapsed reservoir filled with volcanic fluids and faulting activities along the Shanchiao Fault.","Cent Weather Bur, Seismol Ctr, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.;  NARLabs, Natl Ctr Res Earthquake Engn, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Ind Technol Res Inst, Hsinchu, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,8,1.0,1.0,"Pu, HC (corresponding author), Cent Weather Bur, 64 Gongyuan Rd, Taipei, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and Technology, R.O.C.; Central Weather Bureau","The authors would like to thank the Ministry of Science and Technology, R.O.C., and the Central Weather Bureau for financial support.

The updated GPS velocity field collected from 2002 to 2014 and leveling vertical velocity field from 2004 to 2010 were inverted by a 3-D block model in this study to infer the tectonic block rotations and fault slip rates in reference to the Eurasian plate. Our optimized modeling results show that the clockwise rotation rate of 20.8 degrees +/- 2.8 degrees/Myr in the Hualien block is caused by the coupling of the waning arc-continent collision between the Luzon volcanic arc and the Eurasian plate, and the northeastward migration of the block toward the Ryukyu trench. In Ilan domain, the rapid clockwise motion was derived at a rate of 34.9 degrees +/- 65.9 degrees/Myr in southern part of the plain. We proposed that the rapid clockwise rotation results from the asymmetry rifting at the southwestward extension of the Okinawa trough.

2017.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Landsea duel in the late Quaternary at the mouth of a small river with high sediment yield,Yang R;Liu J;Fan D;Burr G;Lin H;Chen T,"The transition between sedimentary environments is compressed along land-sea boundaries in space and time. At river mouths on high standing islands, sedimentary records with high temporal resolutions formed as a result of large sediment loads and pervasive post-glacial sea level rise. Here we report on sediment core records covering the late Quaternary from the mouth of a small mountainous river in Taiwan. Results show that the study site was initially terrestrial under fluvial control. Beginning at about 10,000 yr BP (before present) the site became inundated by the rising sea and the environmental facies transitioned from a floodplain/incised river valley to a succession of marine environments, from shoreface to offshore. As the rising sea level came to a pause at 6000 yr BP, fluvial processes became dominant and sediments began to aggrade at the river mouth. After 4500 yr BP, the accumulated sediment began to prograde seaward, taking on the form of a river delta, and subtidal sand ridges appeared in the nearshore. This also introduces the deltaic development, which was limited by topography of the receiving basin.

2017.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Late Holocene clifftop dune evolution in the Hengchun Peninsula of Taiwan Implications for palaeoenvironmental reconstruction,Ho L;Luthgens C;Wong Y;Yen J;Chyi S,"The Fung-Chuei-Sha (FCS) cliff-top dunes, the only coastal cliff-top dunes known in Taiwan, are situated on a 70 m high, tectonically uplifted Quaternary marine terrace surface in the Hengchun Peninsula of southern Taiwan. The development of the FCS dune and its relationship with palaeoenvironmental changes are still unknown. The optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating approach utilizing a pIRIR150 (post infrared, infrared stimulated luminescence at 150 degrees C) single aliquot regenerative (SAR) dose protocol for K-rich feldspar, in combination with radiocarbon dates and high resolution sedimentological analyzes, have proven to be a powerful tool for reconstructing the depositional history of the FCS dune and the related palaeoenvironmental conditions during the late Holocene. This study identified three major aeolian sediment accumulation periods at similar to 4 ka to similar to 2.3 ka, similar to 1.8 ka to similar to 1.1 ka, and similar to 0.7 ka to similar to 0.4 ka, which are consistent with the cold/cooling periods identified from the palaeoclimate record of the Dongyuan Lake in southern Taiwan. Two palaeosurfaces and two short interruptions of sand accumulation indicate periods of surface stabilization at the FCS site. The OSL ages and radiocarbon ages from the dune, and the palaeoclimate data from Dongyuan Lake suggest that these surfaces developed at similar to 4.3 ka, similar to 2 ka, similar to 1 ka and similar to 0.3 ka. The palaeoclimatic conditions inferred from the FCS dunes are largely consistent with those reconstructed for the coastal dunes of the Fulong Beach area in northeastern Taiwan. This may indicate an over-regional pattern of dune formation primarily driven by strong winds of the Asian Winter Monsoon as the primary forcing factor for coastal dune development in Taiwan during the late Holocene.","Natl Kaohsiung Normal Univ, Dept Geog, 116 He Ping 1st Rd, Kaohsiung 80201, Taiwan.;  Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci BOKU, Inst Appl Geol, Vienna, Austria.;  Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Studies, Hualien, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;AUSTRIA;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,5,1.0,1.0,"Ho, LD (corresponding author), Natl Kaohsiung Normal Univ, Dept Geog, 116 He Ping 1st Rd, Kaohsiung 80201, Taiwan.", [MOST 104-2119-M-259-004-],"The authors are grateful to Dr. C.-C.

Asian Earth Sci.,Magmaticlike fluid source of the Chingshui geothermal field NE Taiwan evidenced by carbonate clumpedisotope paleothermometry,Lu Y;Song S;Wang P;Wu C;Mii H;MacDonald J;Shen C;John C,"The Chingshui geothermal field, a moderate-temperature and water-dominated hydrothermal system, was the site of the first geothermal power plant in Taiwan. Many geological, geophysical and geochemical studies using more than 21 drilled wells have been performed since the 1960s. However, there are still controversies regarding the heat and fluid sources due to the tectonically complicated geological setting. To clarify the heat and fluid sources, we analyzed clumped isotopes with carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions of calcite scaling in geothermal wells and veins on outcrops and calculated the 8180 values of the source fluids. Two populations of delta O-18 values were calculated: 5.8 +/- 0.8 parts per thousand VSMOW from scaling in the well and -4.0 +/- 1.6 parts per thousand to 10.0 +/- 1.39 parts per thousand VSMOW from outcropping calcite veins, indicative of meteoric and magmatic fluid sources, respectively. Meanwhile, two hydrothermal reservoirs at different depths have been identified by magnetotelluric (MT) imaging with micro-seismicity underneath this area. As a result, we propose a two-reservoir model: the shallow reservoir provides fluids from meteoric water for the scaling sampled from wells, whereas the deep reservoir provides magmatic fluids from deep marble decarbonization recorded in outcropping calcite veins.

2017.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,MidLate Miocene vegetation and environments in Southeast China Insights from a marine palynological record in northwestern Taiwan,Hao X;Weng C;Huang C;Ouyang X,"Taiwan Island represents the exposed accretionary prism developed by eastward subduction of South China Sea (SCS) oceanic lithosphere beneath the Philippine Sea Plate since the middle Miocene. There are many well-documented data about the biostratigraphic correlation, except for palynological studies. Here, we present a new palynological record of mid-Late Miocene deposits from the Chuhuangkeng section, Miaoli, northwestern Taiwan, which reveals a vegetation and paleoelevation reconstruction in Southeast China, during the Middle to Late Miocene, corresponding to the time interval of about 14.5-5.5 Ma. Most samples yielded well-preserved palynomorphs, and the palynological results suggest that the dominant vegetation was the mixed coniferous-broadleaved forests in the Coastal Mountains of Southeast China (CMSC) during the Mid-Late Miocene. Moreover, based on large amounts of Tsuga and Picea pollen, we hypothesized that a subalpine conifer forest then flourished in the CMSC, and the estimated maximum paleoelevation might be up to similar to 3000 m above sea level (a.s.l.) during the Mid-Late Miocene, being 1000-1500 m higher than today. These findings offer a new perspective to comprehend the paleotopographic evolution of China and the source area of Taiwan's spruce forests. Additionally, the high abundance of Pinus, Tsuga, Picea pollen and fern spores also suggests an enhancement of the EASM during the Mid-Late Miocene. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

2017.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Probable dynamic triggering of phreatic eruption in the Tatun volcano group of Taiwan,Lin C,"On 16 March 2014 (UTC), a small phreatic eruption occurred in the Tatun volcano group (TVG) of Taiwan, although it was not reported until analysis of both seismic and acoustic data revealed that the source was in the vicinity of the Hsiaoyukeng fumarole. A replay of the acoustic data accelerated similar to 60-fold reveals that the gradual decrease in frequency that was recorded produces a volcanic whistle, similar to the jet of steam released from a heating kettle. The phreatic eruption may have been dynamically triggered by a M6.7 earthquake in Chile. A similar phenomenon occurred on 5 January 2015, when a phreatic eruption was recorded in the TVG immediately after the generation of dynamic seismic waves by an M5.0 earthquake in Japan. This is the first scientific report of a phreatic eruption detected in the TVG, indicating that these volcanoes are still active. As a result, it is important to monitor their volcanic activity and identify volcanic reservoirs beneath the TVG to mitigate future possible volcanic impact. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

2017.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Simultaneous assessment of the median annual seismicity rates and their dispersions for Taiwan earthquakes in different depth ranges,Chang W;Chen K;Tsai Y,"The main purpose of this study is to apply an innovative approach to assess simultaneously the median annual seismicity rates and their dispersions for Taiwan earthquakes in different depth ranges. In this approach an alternative Gutenberg-Richter (G-R) relation is explicitly expressed in terms of both the logarithmic mean annual seismicity rate and its standard deviation, instead of only by the arithmetic mean in the conventional G-R relation. Seismicity data from 1975 to 2014 in a Taiwan earthquake catalog with homogenized M-W moment magnitudes are used in this study. This catalog consists of high-quality earthquake data originally obtained by the Institute of Earth Sciences (IES) and the Central Weather Bureau (CWB). The selected seismicity data set is shown to be complete for M-W >= 3.0. The logarithmic mean annual seismicity rate and its standard deviation from the observed annual seismicity rates of individual years are obtained initially for different M ranges. It is shown subsequently that the logarithmic annual seismicity rates indeed possess a well-behaved lognormal distribution. It is further shown that our new approach has an added merit that tends to suppress the influences of anomalously high annual seismicity rates due to large numbers of aftershocks from major earthquake sequences. Finally, the observed logarithmic mean annual seismicity rates with their standard deviations for 3.0 <= M-W <= 5.0 are used to obtain the alternative Gutenberg-Richter relations for different depth ranges. The results are as follows: log(10)N= 5.75 - 0.90M(W) +/- (0.25 - 0.01M(W)) for focal depth 0-300 km; log(10)N = 5.78 - 0.94M(W) +/- (0.20 + 0.01M(W)) for focal depth 0-35 km; log(10)N = 4.72 - 0.89M(W) +/- (-0.08 0.08M(W)) for focal depth 35-70 lcm; log(10)N = 4.69 - 0.88M(W) +/- (-0.47 + 0.16M(W)) for focal depth 70-300 km. In above equations log(10)N represents the logarithmic annual seismicity rate. These G-R relations give distinctly different values of the parameters a and b for Taiwan earthquakes in different depth ranges. These analytical equations can be readily used to obtain both the mean logarithmic annual seismicity rate and its standard deviation for any given M. As an example, a numerical table presenting the corresponding median annual seismicity rates and their upper and lower bounds at median one standard deviation levels, is given at the end. This table offers a concise glance at the annual seismicity rates for Taiwan earthquakes of various magnitudes and focal depths. It is interesting to point out that the seismicity rate of crustal earthquakes, which tends to contribute most hazards, accounts for only about 74% of the overall seismicity rate in Taiwan. Accordingly, direct use of the entire earthquake catalog without differentiating focal depth ranges may result in substantial overestimates of potential seismic hazards. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

2017.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Site correction of a highfrequency stronggroundmotion simulation based on an empirical transfer function,Huang J;Wen K;Lin C;Kuo C;Chen C;Chang S,"In this study, an empirical transfer function (ETF), which is the spectrum difference in Fourier amplitude spectra between observed strong ground motion and synthetic motion obtained by a stochastic point source simulation technique, is constructed for the Taipei Basin, Taiwan. The basis stochastic point source simulations can be treated as reference rock site conditions in order to consider site effects. The parameters of the stochastic point-source approach related to source and path effects are collected from previous well-verified studies. A database of shallow, small-magnitude earthquakes is selected to construct the ETFs so that the point-source approach for synthetic motions might be more widely applicable. The high-frequency synthetic motion obtained from the ETF procedure is site-corrected in the strong site response area of the Taipei Basin. The site-response characteristics of the ETF show similar responses as in previous studies, which indicates that the base synthetic model is suitable for the reference rock conditions in the Taipei Basin. The dominant frequency contour corresponds to the shape of the bottom of the geological basement (the top of the Tertiary period), which is the Sungshan formation. Two clear high-amplification areas are identified in the deepest region of the Sungshan formation, as shown by an amplification contour of 0.5 Hz: Meanwhile, a high-amplification area was shifted to the basin's edge, as shown by an amplification contour of 2.0 Hz. Three target earthquakes with different kinds of source conditions, including shallow small-magnitude events, shallow and relatively large-magnitude events, and deep small-magnitude events relative to the ETF database, are tested to verify site correction. The results indicate that ETF-based site correction is effective for shallow earthquakes, even those with higher magnitudes, but is not suitable for deep earthquakes. Finally, one of the most significant shallow large magnitude earthquakes (the 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake in Taiwan) is verified in this study. A finite fault stochastic simulation technique is applied, owing to the complexity of the fault rupture process for the Chi-Chi earthquake, and the ETF-based site-correction function is multiplied to-obtain a precise simulation of high-frequency (up to 10 Hz) strong motions. The high-frequency prediction has good agreement in both time and frequency domain in this study, and the prediction level is the same as that predicted by the site-corrected ground motion prediction equation.

2017.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Spatial and temporal anomalies of soil gas in northern Taiwan and its tectonic and seismic implications,Fu C;Yang T;Chen C;Lee L;Wu Y;Liu T;Walia V;Kumar A;Lai T,"In this paper, we study (1) the spatial anomalies and (2) the temporal anomalies of soil gas in northern Taiwan. The spatial anomalies of soil gas are related to tectonic faults, while the temporal anomalies of soil gas are associated with pre-earthquake activities. Detailed soil gas sampling was systematically performed, and the analysis of the collected gas species shows that high helium and nitrogen concentrations appear in samples from specific sites, which coincide with the structural setting of the area studied. This analysis indicates the possibility of using these soil gases to determine fault zones in the studied area. Based on the soil gas data, a station (Tapingti) for automatic soil gas monitoring was constructed on an appropriate site at the fault zone. Some anomalous high radon concentrations at certain times can be identified from the dataset, which was generated by the continuous monitoring of soil gas for over a year. Notably, many of these anomalies were observed several hours to a few days before the earthquakes (M-L > 3) that occurred in northern Taiwan. By combining the information of epicenters and fault plane solutions of these earthquakes, we find that the shallow earthquakes (<15 km) were mainly strike slip and normal-type earthquakes, and concentrated within a distance of 30 km to the monitoring site (Group A). The deep earthquakes (>20 km) were mainly thrust-type earthquakes and distributed in greater distances (>45 km) east of the monitoring site (Group B). Such focal mechanisms of earthquakes suggest an extensional and compressional structural domain in the continental crust for Group A and Group B earthquakes, respectively. It is suggested that the pre-earthquake activities associated with the seismicity of Group B may be transmitted along the major decollement in the region below the Tapingti station, leading to the observed soil gas enhancements.

The fold-and-thrust belt in northern Taiwan shows an arcuate shape from SW to NE: the strike of the main tectonic structures changes from N0 degrees E to N70 degrees E. Such curvature has not yet been properly interpreted so far. In this study we used paleomagnetic analyses to decipher the tectonic evolution along the fold-and-thrust belt in northern Taiwan, which reveals complex magnetization patterns both in ante-folding and post-folding formations. We also interpret that the fold-and-thrust belt in northern Taiwan has experienced two main rotational events: a 30-60 +/- 14 degrees clockwise rotation followed by a 30 +/- 7 degrees counterclockwise rotation during the ages of 4.6-1.5 Ma.","UMR SPE CNRS 6134, Lab Hydrogeol, Campus Grimaldi, F-20250 Corte, France.;  Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, 128 Acad Rd Sect 2, Taipei 115, Taiwan.;",FRANCE;TAIWAN,FRANCE,FRANCE,3,2.0,1.0,"Sonnette, L (corresponding author), UMR SPE CNRS 6134, Lab Hydrogeol, Campus Grimaldi, F-20250 Corte, France.",Academia SinicaAcademia Sinica - Taiwan,"The first author deeply appreciates Prof. Jacques Angelier who supervised him during his Ph.D thesis and supported him to study the NE of Taiwan before passing away in January 2010.

Asian Earth Sci.,The Keelung Submarine Volcano in the nearshore area of northern Taiwan and its tectonic implication,Tsai C;Hsu S;Lin S;Yang T;Wang S;Doo W;Lee H;Lan T;Huang J;Liang C,"The Taiwan mountain belt has been created due to the collision between the Philippine Sea Plate and the Eurasian Plate. Northernmost Taiwan and its offshore area are now under post-collisional collapse. The post-collisional magmatism is distributed around northern Taiwan. Here we first report a submarine volcano, named Keelung Submarine Volcano, existing in the near-shore area of northern Taiwan. The high (3)Hei(4)He ratios in the collected seawater samples suggest that the magma of the Keelung Submarine Volcano is derived from a mantle source. Geometrically, both the Keelung Submarine Volcano and the Tatun Volcano Group are situated above the western border of the subducted Philippine Sea Plate and may have a same magma source. Both volcanic areas belong to the northern Taiwan volcanic zone, instead of the Ryukyu volcanic front. The Keelung Submarine Volcano has been rotated clockwise similar to 48 degrees after its formation, which implies that the Keelung Submarine Volcano has formed before the Luzon arc collided against northern Taiwan. Consequently, the post-collisional model to explain the formation of the northern Taiwan volcanic zone is questionable. As indicated by numerous shallow earthquakes and persistent emissions of the volcanic gases out of the seafloor around the volcanic cone, the Keelung Submarine Volcano is as active as the Tatun Volcano Group. For the sake of volcanic hazard assessment, it is essential to monitor the activity of the Keelung Submarine Volcano.

2017.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Westward advance of the deformation front and evolution of submarine canyons offshore of southwestern Taiwan,Han W;Liu C;Chi W;Chen L;Lin C;Chen S,"This study analyzes both 2D and 3D seismic images around the Palm Ridge area offshore of southwestern Taiwan to understand how the deformation front shifted westward and how tectonic activities interact with submarine canyon paths in the transition area between the active and passive margins. Palm Ridge is a submarine ridge that developed on the passive China continental margin by down-dip erosion of several tributaries of Penghu Canyon; it extends eastward across the deformation front into the submarine Taiwan accretionary wedge. The presence of proto-thrusts that are located west of the frontal thrust implies that the compressional stress field has advanced westward due to the convergence of the Philippine Sea Plate and Eurasian Plate. Since the deformation front is defined as the location of the most frontal contractional structure, no significant contractional structure should appear west of it. We thus suggest moving the location of the previously mapped deformation front farther west to where the westernmost proto-thrust lies. High-resolution seismic and bathymetric data reveal that the directions of the paleo-submarine canyons run transverse to the present slope dip, while the present submarine canyons head down slope in the study area. We propose that this might be the result of the westward migration of the deformation front that changed the paleo-bathymetry and thus the canyon path directions. The interactions of down-slope processes and active tectonics control the canyon paths in our study area.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, Taipei, Taiwan.;  GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, Kiel, Germany.;  Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Minist Econ Affairs, Cent Geol Survey, Taipei, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;GERMANY;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,6,1.0,,"Liu, CS (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, Taipei, Taiwan.","Central Geological Survey, MOEAMinistry of Economic Affairs, Taiwan [103-5226904000-03-01, 104-5226904000-02-01]","We would like to thank Yun-Shuen Wang, San-Hsiung Chung and the Central Geological Survey, Ministry of Economic Affairs, for the projects that made this study possible.

2018.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Basal accretion a major mechanism for mountain building in Taiwan revealed in rock thermal history,Chen C;Chan Y;Lo C;Malavieille J;Lu C;Tang J;Lee Y,"Deep tectonic processes are key integral components in the evolution of mountain belts, while observations of their temporal development are generally obscured by thermal resetting, retrograde alteration and structural overprinting. Here we recorded an integrated rock time-temperature history for the first time in the pro-wedge part of the active Taiwan arc-continent collision starting from sedimentation through cleavage-forming state to its final exhumation. The integrated thermal and age results from the Raman Spectroscopy of Carbonaceous Material (RSCM) method, zircon U-Pb laser ablation dating, and in-situ Ar-40/Ar-39 laser microprobe dating suggest that the basal accretion process was crucial to the development of the Taiwanese orogenic wedge. The basal accretion process commenced early in the mountain building history (similar to 6 Ma) and gradually migrated to greater depths, as constrained by persistent plate convergence and cleavage formation under nearly isothermal state at similar depths until similar to 2.5 Ma recorded in the early-accreted units. Such development essentially contributed to mountain root growth by the increased depth of the wedge detachment and the downward wedge thickening during the incipient to full collision stages in the Taiwan mountain belt.","Natl Cent Univ, Dept Earth Sci, 300 Zhongda Rd, Zhongli, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, 1,Sec 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, 128,Sec 2,Acad Rd, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Univ Montpellier 2, Geosci Montpellier, Pl E Bataillon, F-34095 Montpellier 5, France.;  Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, 168 Univ Rd,Min Hsiung, Chiayi, Taiwan.;  CNRS, MOST, France Taiwan Int Lab, LIA D3E, Paris, France.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;FRANCE;TAIWAN;FRANCE,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,7,1.0,1.0,"Chen, CT (corresponding author), Natl Cent Univ, Dept Earth Sci, 300 Zhongda Rd, Taoyuan 320001, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, R.O.C.Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [106-2119-M-008-023, 105-2116-M-001-019, 106-2116-M-001-020, 102-2116-M-002-027-MY3, 105-2811-M-002-123, 106-2116-M-002-017, 105-2116-M-002-016, 106-2116-M-002-016]; National Central University","CTC wishes to acknowledge Tzen-Fu Yu, Hao-Tsu Chu, Olivier Beyssac, Martine Simoes, and Jian-Cheng Lee for their helpful discussions on the analytical techniques and Taiwan wedge kinematics.

2018.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Magmatic pulses of the Tatun Volcano Group northern Taiwan revisited Constraints from zircon UPb ages and Hf isotopes,Chu M;Lai Y;Li Q;Chen W;Song S;Lee H;Lin T,"The initiation and duration of magmatism in the Tatun Volcano Group (TVG), likely resulting from extensional collapse of the northern Taiwan mountain belt, remains an important issue of debates in the Taiwan orogeny. Here we report a detailed study of U-Pb ages determined by SIMS and LA-ICPMS, together with Hf isotopic data, of zircon separates from a total of 22 extrusive rocks from the TVG lava flow and additional two andesites from Keelungyu (KLY), a volcanic islet off NE Taiwan. Magmatic zircons from the TVG are characterized by uniform and high Hf isotopic ratios, with epsilon(Hf)(T) mostly from +20 to +10. Their overall Pb-206/U-238 ages suggest that the TVG magmatism was initiated similar to 3 Ma but more active <= 0.8 Ma with a flare up <= 0.35 Ma. Magmatic zircons from the two KLY samples reveal identical Pb-206/U-238 ages (0.41 Ma), coupled with Hf isotopes [epsilon(Hf)(T): +25 to +9] comparable to those of the TVG. Thus, KLY is proposed as part of the TVG. Consequently, we argue that the main body of the TVG formed <= 0.8 Ma by post-collisional volcanism, but the mechanism resulting in the magmatic episodes >= 1.0 Ma remains obscure due to the scarcity of rock exposures.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geol & Geophys, State Key Lab Lithospher Evolut, Beijing, Peoples R China.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;CHINA;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,7,1.0,0.0,"Chu, MF (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, Taipei, Taiwan.",,,Taiwan; Tatunvolcano; Zircon; U-Pb geochronology; Hf isotope,10.1016/j.jseaes.2018.05.028,Article,POSTCOLLISIONAL MAGMATISM; GEOCHEMICAL CONSTRAINTS; EVOLUTION; GEOCHRONOLOGY; PETROGENESIS; GENERATION; ANDESITE; GENESIS; ROCKS; LEAD,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES,1,167,ISI,NATL TAIWAN UNIV;NATL TAIWAN NORMAL UNIV;INST GEOL AND GEOPHYS;NATL TAIWAN UNIV;INST EARTH SCI,NATL TAIWAN UNIV,B2

To obtain the Bouguer gravity anomalies, the densities of land terrain and marine sediments were assumed to be 2.53 and 1.80 g/cm(3), respectively. The updated gravity dataset was gridded with a spacing of one arc-minute. Several previously unnoticed gravity features are revealed by the new maps and can be used in a broad range of applications: (1) An isolated gravity high is located between the Shoushan and the Kaoping Canyon off southwest Taiwan. (2) Along the Luzon Arc, both Free-air and Bouguer gravity anomaly maps reveal a significant gravity discontinuity feature at the latitude of 21 degrees 20'N.

2018.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Seismic evidence for central Taiwan magnetic low and deepcrustal deformation caused by plate collision,Cheng W,"Crustal seismic velocity structure was determined for the northern Taiwan using seismic travel-time data to investigate the northeastern extension of the northern South China Sea's high-magnetic belt. In order to increase the model resolution, a joint analysis of gravity anomaly and seismic travel-time data have been conducted. A total of 3385 events had been used in the inversion that was collected by the Central Weather Bureau Seismological Network from 1990 to 2015. The main features of the obtained three-dimensional velocity model are: (1) a relatively high Vp zone with velocity greater than 6.5 km/s is observed in the middle to lower crust, (2) the high Vp zone generally parallels to the north south structural trending of the Chuchih fault and Hsuehshan Range, (3) at 25 km depth-slice, the high Vp zone shows structural trends change from northeastward to northward in central Taiwan, where the values of high-magnetic anomalies are rapidly decreasing to low values. A combination of seismic, GPS, and structural interpretations suggests that the entire crust has been deformed and demagnetized in consequence of the collision between the Philippine Sea plate and the Asian continental margin. We suggest that the feature of sharp bending of the high Vp zone would migrate southwestward and cause further crustal deformation of the Peikang High in the future.","Jinwen Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Environm Technol & Property Management, New Taipei, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,1,1.0,1.0,"Cheng, WB (corresponding author), Jinwen Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Environm Technol & Property Management, New Taipei, Taiwan.","National Science Council of TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 104-2116-M-228-001]","The author is grateful to the Seismological Observation Center, Central Weather Bureau, for providing earthquake data.

Asian Earth Sci.,Tectonic affinities of the accreted basalts in southern Taiwan,Chen H;Yang H;Liu Y;Huang K;Takazawa E,"Tectonic affinities of accreted basalts provide constraints on mass transport in convergent boundaries, improving our understandings on the evolution of regional geology. In this study, nineteen accreted basalts from the southernmost tip of Taiwan Island, which is on the convergent boundary between the Eurasian and Philippine Sea Plates, were analyzed for element concentrations as well as Sr, Nd, Hf, and Pb isotope ratios to investigate their tectonic affinities. All the samples contain > 3% LOI, reflecting post-magmatic alteration. LOI and Nb variation diagrams together with comparisons to oceanic basalt compositions indicated that the concentrations of most major elements and Rb, Sr, and Ba were modified by post-magmatic processes to varying extents, while P2O5, REE and HFSE remained immobile. Although some samples show Pb loss, most samples have Pb concentrations not affected by post-magmatic processes. Isotope ratios of Pb, Nd and Hf, generally reflect the mantle source characteristics. The epsilon(Nd)-epsilon(Hf) relationship and trace element abundance ratios indicated that the LREE-depleted samples were mostly scraped off the subducting South China Sea floor, reflecting the volumetric dominance of N-MORB on ocean floors. The overriding Philippine Sea Plate contributed both N-MORB and E-MORB to the accretionary prism. The tectonic affinities of the LREE-enriched samples, however, could not be unambiguously determined for the large geochemical variability of OIB from both subducting and overlying slabs. Based on our results, it is proposed that the tectonic affinity of the basalts in an accretionary prism can indicate the subduction polarity of the associated convergent boundary, providing a constraint for regional geology evolution.","Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Tainan, Taiwan.;  Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Niigata Univ, Dept Geol, Nishi Ku, 8050,Ikarashi 2 No Cho, Niigata 9502181, Japan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;JAPAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,5,1.0,1.0,"Yang, HJ (corresponding author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Tainan, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) of TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan; MOST [103103103, 104104104, 105105105]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [16H02742] Funding Source: KAKEN","thank Tung-Hsin Su, Yu-Chin Huang, Shih-Wei Wang, and Kung-Suan Ho for assistance with sample collection and preparation, Chia-Ju Chieh and Li-Yun Huang for chemical and isotopic analyses, and Yuki Yoshida and Yoshihiro Enya for XRF analysis.

Here, we present field observations, petrography, mineralogy, stable carbon isotope data, as well as rare earth element compositions. We evaluate the role of diagenetic alteration on the Kuohsing seep carbonates and constrain their fluid sources and formation conditions. Four main morphologies in the field were observed, including cylindrical columns, massive forms, lenticular nodules, and stratiform bodies. Petrographically, the carbonates are predominantly composed of partially recrystallized calcite and dolomite, with abundant amounts of biogenic detritus, pyrite aggregations and unidentified filaments. Isotopic analyses show that carbon isotope values inversely vary with oxygen isotope values, indicating substantial modification of the carbon isotope compositions of the carbonates by diagenetic processes. Extremely negative delta C-13 values as low as -47.6 parts per thousand recognized as a near-primary isotopic signature recorded in the carbonates, an end member of the trend, reveals that methane was incorporated during the carbonate precipitation. On the other hand, the carbonates have well preserved primary REE compositions, exhibiting MREE enrichment, no La and Ce anomalies, and supra-chondritic Y/Ho ratios. These REE patterns suggest that the Kuohsing authigenic carbonates were precipitated from reducing seep fluids with limited admixture of seawater.","Chinese Acad Sci, Guangzhou Inst Geochem, CAS Key Lab Ocean & Marginal Sea Geol, Guangzhou 510640, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;  Shanghai Ocean Univ, Coll Marine Sci, Shanghai Engn Res Ctr Hadal Sci & Technol, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China.;  Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Tainan 701, Taiwan.;",CHINA;CHINA;TAIWAN,CHINA,CHINA,4,3.0,2.0,"Wang, QX (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Guangzhou Inst Geochem, CAS Key Lab Ocean & Marginal Sea Geol, Guangzhou 510640, Guangdong, Peoples R China.","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41502113, 41673029, 41406075, U1505231]","We thank Hailing Jen for field assistance.

Asynchronous collision will exhume materials to the surface at different times and expose different metamorphic grades along the orogenic axis. By tracking the thermal signals of eroded materials, it is possible to compare spatial patterns of exhumation along the mountain belt. Previous studies such as bulk mineralogy of sandstones, crystallinity of clay minerals, and fission track thermochronology all suggest that the Pliocene to Pleistocene meta-sedimentary deposits within the preserved basins of the Coastal Range reflect the unroofing history of the Central Range in Eastern Taiwan. In this study, modern sediments from six drainages of the east Central Range (Liwu, Mugua, Laku-Laku, Luye, Jinlun, and Hsuhai Rivers) and three basin sections of meta-sedimentary deposits from the Coastal Range (Shuilien, Chimei, and Madagida sections) were sampled to reconstruct the thermal signals of each drainage along the modern orogenic axis and reconstruct temporal variations of thermal signals in preserved Plio-Pleistocene sedimentary rocks. The temperature index (T.I.) of modern sediments determined by Raman spectroscopy of carbonaceous materials are medium to high (0.4-0.8). In conjunction with bio- and magneto-stratigraphy, our data suggest that the northern Shuilien area has been receiving detritus of medium metamorphic grade from the exhumed orogeny in the north from 3.4 Ma and higher grade since 2 Ma; meanwhile, the southern Madagida section has been mostly taking in juvenile detritus from the south part of the orogen until 1 Ma. The central Chimei section has started collecting mature detritus since 1.24 Ma. The data suggest that the Plio-Pleistocene basins contain a good record of orogen evolution.","Natl Cent Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Taoyuan, Taiwan.;  Natl Cent Univ, Inst Geophys, Taoyuan, Taiwan.;  Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Studies, Hualien, Taiwan.;  Natl Cent Univ, Grad Inst Appl Geol, Taoyuan, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,5,1.0,1.0,"Yen, JY (corresponding author), Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Studies, Hualien, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and Technology of TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 99-2116-M-259-006]","We would like to thank Ju-Fang Yen, Sin-Yu Chen, Cheng-Ming Su, Fei-Han Hsu and Looh Kati for the fieldwork asistance and Akano Yhokha's help for the early draft of the manuscript.

2018.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Variable uplift rate through time Holocene coral reef and neotectonics of Lutao eastern Taiwan,Shen C;Wu C;Dai C;Gong S,"Significant discrepancies have existed regarding rate and timing of the uplift of Lutao (Green Island), located at the border of the ongoing collision between the Eurasia continental plate and the Philippine Sea Plate. To document its neotectonic history, two cores were drilled into Holocene coral reefs exposed at the southeastern coast of Lutao. Twelve pristine fossil corals, nine taken from cores and three on the surface, were Th-230 dated. The results show that the coral reefs started to develop at 8,736 +/- 56 yr BP (before 1950 CE) with uplift rate varying from 3.6 mm/yr during 8.7-6.0 kyr BP to 1.2 mm/yr in the past six thousand years. Our study strongly suggests that the uplift rate can vary significantly on millennial time scale. Caution should be used when extrapolating uplift rate estimates based on Mid-late Holocene corals to early times for tectonic active locations, such as Lutao.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, High Precis Mass Spectrometry & Environm Change L, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, Taipei 1061Z, Taiwan.;  Natl Museum Nat Sci, Dept Geol, Taichung 40419, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,4,1.0,1.0,"Gong, SY (corresponding author), Natl Museum Nat Sci, 1 Kuan Chien Rd, Taichung 40419, Taiwan.","Taiwan MOST [99-2116-M-178-005, 100-2116-M-178-002]; Taiwan ROC MOST [105-2119-M-002-001]; National Taiwan UniversityNational Taiwan University [105R7625]","This study was supported by Taiwan MOST grants (99-2116-M-178-005 and 100-2116-M-178-002 to SYG).

Asian Earth Sci.,Fractal and spectral investigation of the shallow seismicity in Taiwan,Telesca L;Chen C,"We studied the whole and aftershock-depleted shallow (depth <= 30 km) Taiwanese seismicity from 1990 to 2017 by using several independent methods. The coefficient of variations and the Allan Factor have revealed that time-clustering characterizes not only the time distribution of the whole seismic catalogue, but also that of the aftershock-depleted one, although this displays time-clustering at larger timescales. In particular the Allan Factor shows that at small timescales the seismic process of the whole as well as the aftershock-depleted one can be well described by a Poisson process. The detrended fluctuation analysis clearly evidence persistence in the interevent times and weak persistence or randomness in the magnitudes. The singular spectrum analysis of the daily counts in the aftershock-depleted catalogue reveals the existence of quasi-monthly and bi-weekly periodicities. Furthermore, quasi-annual and quasi-semestral periodicities have been identified that strengthen the link between seismic activity in Taiwan and Earth's tides.","CNR, Inst Methodol Environm Anal, I-85050 Tito, PZ, Italy.;  Natl Cent Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Taoyuan, Taiwan.;  Natl Cent Univ, Earthquake Disaster & Risk Evaluat & Management C, Taoyuan, Taiwan.;",ITALY;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,ITALY,ITALY,2,2.0,1.0,"Telesca, L (corresponding author), CNR, Inst Methodol Environm Anal, I-85050 Tito, PZ, Italy.",CNR-MOST 2018-2019 Common Project,The authors would like to express gratitude to CWB in Taiwan for providing the quality earthquake catalogue.

2019.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Geological records of South China Sea tsunamis on Penghu Islands Taiwan,Lu C;Yen J;Chyi S;Yu N;Chen J,"The coasts around the South China Sea are highly populated and threatened by the ubiquitous tsunamigenic structures of the Manila trench-arc system. However, owing to limited historical records and rare geological findings of tsunamis, our comprehension of and preparation for regional tsunami risks are far from sufficient. Located in the NE South China Sea, the Penghu Islands in Taiwan's western offshore area are selected for a geological tsunami survey because of their advantages of lengthy coastlines and abundant upper Holocene deposits. Three gravel layers of marine incursion events were identified and correlated between three far-separated coastal sections based on the constraints of radiocarbon dating. Intercalated with talus, soil, and dune sand, the gravel layers are poorly sorted, matrix-supported, up to boulder in size, and dominated by marine bioclastics and rounded basalts, which are identical to modern beach gravels. The deposits are located 3-4 m above present sea level, which is significantly higher than the local high tide levels and maximal typhoon surges of 2-3 m high. Furthermore, the deposits are distributed extensively on south-facing shores, indicating relatively large and abnormal inundation events from the South China Sea. Based on the radiocarbon dating results of the event deposits, three tsunamis likely occurred in the periods from the 4th to 6th, 11th to 12th, and 15th to 16th centuries. A recurrence interval of 400-500 years is accordingly associated with these event deposits. These findings demonstrate great tsunami risks exist in the South China Sea basin and call for more attestations and future studies. The major contribution of this study is also supported by the AD 1076 Guangzhou tsunami, which is comparable in age to the middle event deposit.","Natl Penghu Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Tourism & Leisure, Taipei, Penghu, Taiwan.;  Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Studies, Hualien, Taiwan.;  Natl Kaohsiung Normal Univ, Dept Geog, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.;  Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Ctr Gen Educ, Hsinchu, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,5,1.0,1.0,"Yen, JY (corresponding author), Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Studies, Hualien, Taiwan.","National Taiwan UniversityNational Taiwan University; Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, R.O.C.Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [105-2116-M-346-001, 104-2119-M-259-004, 103-2119-M-259-001]","The authors thank Prof. K.

The direction of the T-axes derived from the M-L 4.1 earthquake and the background seismicity off SW Taiwan present high consistency, indicating a stable dominant NW-SE tensional stress for the subducted Eurasian Plate (EUP). The distinct stress variations on the two sides of these reactivated NE-SW trending features suggest that the presence of pre-existing normal faults and other related procecses may lessen the lateral resistance between the Taiwan collision and Manila subduction system, and facilitate the slab-pull process for the subducting portion, which may explain the NW-SE tensional stress environment near the transition boundary in the northernmost part of the SCS.","Natl Cent Univ, Dept Earth Sci, 300 Jhongda Rd, Taoyuan 32001, Taiwan.;  Natl Cent Univ, Ctr Environm Studies, 300 Jhongda Rd, Taoyuan 32001, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,5,1.0,1.0,"Lin, JY (corresponding author), Natl Cent Univ, Dept Earth Sci, 300 Jhongda Rd, Taoyuan 32001, Taiwan.","Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan [MOCT-CWB-107-E-05]; Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, R.O.C.Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST-107-2116-M-008-017]","We thank the Geophysical Database Management System (Shin et al., 2013), developed by the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) of Taiwan for providing earthquake catalog.

2020.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Miocene sedimentary provenance and paleogeography of the Hengchun Peninsula southern Taiwan Implications for tectonic development of the Taiwan orogen,Tsai C;Shyu J;Chung S;Lee H,"The pre-collisional sedimentary provenance of southern Taiwan not only can offer important information about the paleogeography of the region prior to the Taiwan orogeny, but may also provide significant constraint for understanding the origin of the Central Range of Taiwan and the history of the orogen. Although there have been previous studies on sedimentary provenance of the Hengchun Peninsula, the southernmost part of the Taiwan mountain belt, these studies appear to have limited sample coverage. Therefore, we performed detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology and hafnium isotopic analysis of samples covering all three Mid-Late Miocene stratigraphic units of the peninsula. Our results suggest that, whereas the Minjiang (Min River) and the Jiulongjiang (Jiulong River) in SE China are the primary sediment sources for the Shihmen and Lilungshan Formations, the Loshui Formation was likely deposited in a deep sea fan originated from a rifted continental fragment in the south. The developing accretionary prism and proto-Taiwan may have also provided sediments to the area. The proposed presence of a continental fragment that provided sediments in the Loshui Formation supports the hypothesis that the Taiwan orogen may have formed as a double collision that incorporated not only the Luzon Arc and the Eurasian continental margin, but also rifted continental blocks in between.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Univ Oxford, Dept Earth Sci, Oxford, England.;  Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;UNITED KINGDOM;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,4,1.0,1.0,"Shyu, JBH (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) of TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [104-2116-M-002-027-MY4, 105-2923-M-008-003-MY3, 106-2923-M-002-005-MY3]","We are grateful for the assistance of Y.-M.

2020.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Postorogenic thermal reset of the PingtanDongshan metamorphic belt SE China Insights from zircon fission track and UPb double dating,Chen C;Lee C;Tien J;Xiang H;Walia M;Lin J,"Zircon double dating technique for U-Pb and fission track (FT) ages is used to reassess the cooling conditions for the Pingtan-Dongshan Metamorphic Belt (PDMB). Three Cretaceous gneissic bodies from the Chinmen area and two dioritic plutons from the Zhangzhou Igneous Complex (ZIC) in two sides of the Changle-Nanao fault are studied. U-Pb dating results define the magma emplacement of gneisses at 144-134 Ma and dioritic rocks at 102-99 Ma, and FT dating results give ages of 96-86 Ma and similar to 87 Ma for corresponding samples. Combining Ar-40/Ar-39 mineral ages reported previously, the fast cooling curve (86 degrees C/Myr; 100-96 Ma) of ZIC plutons matches near-surface intrusives. However, those for deep-seated Chinmen gneisses are problematic as their resultant conditions are similar to ZIC samples. A recent concept favors the Early to Late Cretaceous tectomagmatic evolution in the coastal SE China involving episodes of orogenic magmatism (147-130 Ma) and shallow magmatism under post-orogenic extension (110-85 Ma). As the Pingtan island in northern PDMB is considered as a remnant piece of colliding fragment, the cooling rate known for gneissic bodies in this island (35 degrees C/Myr; 130-120 Ma) can better represent the record of this collision. On the basis of these features, we advocate a magmatic quiescence at 130-120 Ma representing collision between PDMB and a concealed microcontinent which resulted in rapid uplift of this metamorphic belt. Cooling curves obtained for Chinmen gneisses are suggested to have further subjected to thermal reset by high temperature magmatism taking place during the post-orogenic stage.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, 1,Roosevelt Rd Sect 4, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.;  Chinese Acad Geol Sci, Inst Geol, Beijing 100037, Peoples R China.;",TAIWAN;CHINA,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,6,1.0,1.0,"Chen, CH (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, 1,Roosevelt Rd Sect 4, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and Technology [NSC84, 85-2111-M-001-01, 30]","We are grateful to Mr. K.L.

This paper studies the variation of the S-wave HVSR in the Taipei Basin based on a variety of hypocenter locations. The earthquake records are classified into three categories, include depth, azimuth, and distance.

Besides, the S-wave HVSR in the northern and northeastern parts of the basin also displays source azimuthal-dependence. However, there is no apparent difference in source distance-dependence. In contrast to the S-wave HVSR, the coda-wave HVSR all showed no apparent difference for various earthquake hypocenter locations. The synthetic modeling results support our idea that the cause of the variation of HVSR results for different earthquake focal depths is the different S-wave angles of incidence into the basin. Based on the dependency of the site amplification on the focal depth, a focal-depth-dependent empirical transfer function (ETF) was established. The focal-depth-dependent ETF was verified to improve the accuracy of the ground motion prediction by using the stochastic method in this study.

2020.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Spatial distribution of radiated seismic energy from earthquakes in Taiwan and surrounding regions,Lin T;Mittal H;Wu C;Huang Y,"The radiated energy during earthquakes is one of the essential characteristics that have a significant impact on human lives. The study of the released energy during earthquakes and their distribution may provide a detailed knowledge about the driving forces. In the present work, the earthquakes having magnitude (ML) between 1.98 and 7.3 that occurred between 1994 and 2017 in and around Taiwan between the latitudes 21.5 degrees N - 25.5 degrees N and longitudes 119 degrees E - 123 degrees E are used to study the spatial distribution of energy in Taiwan. The maximum reported focal depth for the used earthquakes is 320 km. ML is converted to energy with necessary correction in the existing conversion formula using a correction factor based on the energy of two earthquakes that occurred in Taiwan. It is found that the distribution of earthquake numbers and energy is not uniform. In particular, 98% of the events occurred within 100 km depth; while, the remaining 2% were located at deeper depths. Most of the events, about 65% of the total earthquakes are confined to the upper 20 km depth. The earthquakes occurring to a depth of 100 km contribute about 88% of the energy in and around Taiwan. Only a few earthquakes occurring beyond 100 km depth contribute to around 12% of total released energy. The highest energy release is attributed to the eastern subduction along the Ryukyu trench. Our results show that the lower crust and upper mantle may play an essential role in energy distribution, though most of the earthquakes have occurred in the upper crust. Therefore, the temporal and spatial distributions of seismic energy release will be further studied to reveal the characteristics of the seismogenic zone in the future.","Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Tainan, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,4,1.0,1.0,"Mittal, H (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST)Ministry of Science and Technology, China [107-2116-M-006 -016]","The authors thankfully acknowledge the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) for sponsoring the project (Grant No.: 107-2116-M-006 -016), under which this study was carried out.

2020.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Strong ground motion over a large area in northern Taiwan caused by the northward rupture directivity of the 2019 Hualien earthquake,Lee S;Wong T;Liu T;Lin T;Chen C,"An M-w 6.2 earthquake struck Hualien on the eastern coast of Taiwan on April 18, 2019. its focal mechanism was determined to be a thrust fault with a depth of 18.8 km. A wide range of strong ground shaking with an intensity value from 4 (25-80 Gal) to 7 (greater than 400 Gal) occurred in northern Taiwan, which is unusual for earthquakes of this size. Here we show a source model as determined by local seismic waveform inversion. Two asperities were found, the smaller one occurred at the hypocenter and the larger one was found 10 km north of the hypocenter with a depth of 18-25 km. The initial rupture started from the hypocenter and then rapidly propagated all the way to the large asperity in the north. A near supershear speed of close to 4.0 km/s was found to have occurred during this northward rupture process. The inverted source model was evaluated using forward three-dimensional ground motion simulations. The results show strong agreement with island-wide observed displacement waveforms and peak ground acceleration for periods from 3.0 to 20.0 s. The rapid northward rupture caused a strong directivity effect coupled with the specific source radiation pattern, resulting in a large area of strong ground shaking in northern Taiwan, even though the Hualien earthquake was a moderately-sized event.","Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,5,1.0,1.0,"Lee, SJ (corresponding author), Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and Technology in TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [107-2116-M-001-025-MY3]",This study is supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan with grant 107-2116-M-001-025-MY3.

2020.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Subduction of transitional crust at the Manila Trench and its geophysical implications,Tan E,"The subducting South China Sea crust at the northern Manila Trench has been categorized as the transitional crust, which is a rifted, thinned continental crust. We tested the consequence of the subduction of transitional crust with a numerical dynamic model. Our numerical model indicates that, with subducting transitional crust, normal fault earthquakes underneath the accretionary prism would occur deeper and probably with larger magnitude. Normal fault earthquakes near the trench outer rise are usually shallower than 30 km depth around the world. A notable exception is at the northern Manila Trench where normal fault earthquakes around 40 km depth are common, which can be explained by our model. Our result indicates that the stress on the northern segment of the Manila Trench is relaxed, which is less likely to generate great megathrust earthquakes.","Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei 115, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,1,1.0,,"Tan, E (corresponding author), Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei 115, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) of TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [107-2116-M-001-019]",The author wish to thank an anonymous reviewer and the Editor-in Chief for their constructive comments.

2021.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Buchan type metamorphism in the PingtanDongshan metamorphic belt SE China Evidence from combined EMP monazite and UPb zircon ages of mica schists,Lin J;Lee C;Chen C;Kato T;Sano Y;Naoto T,"Detailed age information of the Pingtan-Dongshan Metamorphic Belt in the coastal Cathaysia Block is important in understanding geodynamics of the Late Mesozoic South China continental margin. Geochronological de-terminations on monazite and zircon inclusions and zircon separates from five mica schists and two granites intruding schists are used to constrain the timing of metamorphism and sediment sources. Common ages of monazite and zircon inclusions within major constituents (quartz, muscovite, sillimanite and K-feldspar) in schists define a high temperature/low pressure metamorphic event at-100 Ma. Along with zircon ages of granites (106 and 101 Ma), a Buchan type metamorphism is proposed regarding a heat source from the post-orogenic magmatism in the neighboring igneous province. Based on the age distribution patterns of discrete zircons, two groups of schist are distinguished by sources of sediments prior to metamorphism. One group has a simple age cluster (145-130 Ma) inferring proximal magmatic rocks in the Cathaysia Block. The other group shows a widespread age spectrum with two particular populations of-1.8 Ga and-190 Ma that are uncommon in the Cathaysia Block but comparable to schists in the Tailuko Metamorphic Belt of eastern Taiwan. This may suggest a general source between these two belts in which a now-concealed microcontinent would play a role. Such a new tectonic framework can account for the two provenances of sediments in schists of this belt, and its structural configuration is influenced by a high temperature regime caused by mantle upwelling as a reflection of slab rollback of the subducted Paleo-Pacific Plate during 110-90 Ma.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, 1 Roosevelt Rd,Sect 4, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.;  Nagoya Univ, Inst Space Earth Environm Res, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan.;  Univ Tokyo, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, Tokyo, Japan.;  Kochi Univ, Ctr Adv Marine Core Res, Kochi, Japan.;",TAIWAN;JAPAN;JAPAN;JAPAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,6,1.0,1.0,"Lin, JW (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, 1 Roosevelt Rd,Sect 4, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.","Chung (NTU); Fujian Institute of Geological Survey; Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [105-2116-M-002-011, 106-2116-M-002-013]","Dr. S.-L.

2021.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,Coulomb stress changes triggering surface popup during the 2016 Mw 64 Meinong earthquake with implications for earthquakeinduced mud diapiring in SW Taiwan,Mai H;Lee J;Chen K;Wen K,"We investigated the 2016 Meinong earthquake (Mw 6.4) in southwestern Taiwan, which caused surface pop-up in an area of 10x15 km(2) with maximum uplift of 12 cm, where lies an array of mud volcanoes and possible underlying mud diapir. We calculated 3D strain tensor in a 3D mesh with 5x5x2 km grids in the epicentral area induced by the Coulomb stress change due to coseismic fault slip. We obtained substantial contraction strain (10(-5)-10(-)(6)) that occurred in a lobe showing ""squeezing"" at the depth of 5-14 km below the surface pop-up area. Dilatation strain (10(-5)-10(-)(6)) occurred at shallow level (0-3 km) with a radial pattern around the surface pop-up area. Combining with local geology, which is composed of Mio-Pliocene similar to 5-km-thick mudstone in a fold-thrust belt, we interpret that the 2016 Meinong coseismic surface pop-up was closely related to mud diapirs/volcanoes, which were likely reactivated by sudden increase of fluid pore-pressure in the basal reservoir (at 5-6 km depth) and dilatation in the shallow level. We also explored the potential effects of the Coulomb stress transfer on nearby receiver faults - including three arrays of mud diapir, the regional decollement, a suspected backthrust and one thrust close to the pop-up area. Our results show that the Coulomb stress transfer a) favors NNE-trending mud diapirs in the coseismic pop-up area, with a combination of clamping stress changes at 5-6 km depth and unclamping stress changes at 0-4 km depth, and b) it does not favor triggered thrust slip on the regional thrusts.","Acad Sinica, Taiwan Int Grad Program TIGP, Earth Syst Sci Program, Chungli, Taiwan.;  Natl Cent Univ, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Natl Cent Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Chungli, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,4,1.0,1.0,"Lee, JC (corresponding author), Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) of TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 107-2116-M-001 -026 -MY3]; Academia Sinica, TaiwanAcademia Sinica - Taiwan; National Central University, Taiwan","We are grateful for many constructive comments and suggestions from Chung-Han Chan and an anonymous reviewer, which substantially helped to improve the manuscript.

2021.0,J. Asian Earth Sci.,OligoceneMiocene sequence stratigraphy in the northern margin of the South China Sea An example from Taiwan,Lin A;Yang C;Wang M;Wu J,"Oligocene-Miocene sediments in the Taiwan region were accumulated in the NE passive-continental margin of the South China Sea. We utilized around -200 boreholes and reflection seismic data to study the Oligo-Miocene sequence stratigraphic framework in the Taiwan region. Major sequence boundaries are used to map out various sediment isopach maps, enabling us to decipher dominant tectonic events during the course of passive-margin evolution. The Oligocene-Miocene succession is divided into 16 sequences on the basis of well-log correlation. These 16 sequences can be grouped into four (A, B, C, D) sequence sets. Isopach maps of sequence sets B and C (-21?12.5 Ma) show that they blanket the west Taiwan basins with relatively uniform thickness deposited during uniform and slow basement subsidence. Sequence sets A (-30?21 Ma) and D (-12.5?6.5 Ma), however, thickened into fault-bounded troughs, recording two extensional events that were especially active in the outer margin (i.e., the Tainan Basin). There is a general correlation between the Taiwan Miocene sequences and the glacioeustasy during the interval -21?6.5 Ma. Therefore, eustasy is the dominant control on the Taiwan Miocene stratigraphic development. The deposition of the sequence set A during -30?21 Ma and possibly the sequence set D in the outer margin during the late Miocene, however, appears to have been strongly modulated by extensional tectonics and local sedimentary factors (e.g., rates of basin subsidence, sediment supply and basin physiography, etc.).","Natl Cent Univ, Dept Earth Sci, 300 Jungda Rd, Taoyuan 32001, Taiwan.;  CPC Corp, Explorat & Prod Business Div, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.;  CPC Corp, Explorat & Dev Res Inst, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,4,1.0,1.0,"Lin, AT (corresponding author), Natl Cent Univ, Dept Earth Sci, 300 Jungda Rd, Taoyuan 32001, Taiwan.","CPC Corporation [FEA0711033]; Ministry of Science and Technology, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [105-3113-E-008-009, 108-2116-M-008-002]","This work was supported by CPC Corporation (grant number FEA0711033) and Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan (grant numbers 105-3113-E-008-009, 108-2116-M-008-002).",Passive continental margin; Sequence stratigraphy; South China Sea; Taiwan,10.1016/j.jseaes.2021.104765,Article,CONTINENTAL-MARGIN; COASTAL-PLAIN; RIFT-BASIN; EVOLUTION; EOCENE; LEVEL; UNCONFORMITY; BOUNDARIES; TECTONICS; INSIGHTS,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES,2,213,ISI,NATL CENT UNIV;EXPLORAT AND DEV RES INST,NATL CENT UNIV,B2

Asian Earth Sci.,Variable vertical movements and their deformation behaviors at convergent plate suture 14yearlong 20042018 repeated measurements of precise leveling around middle Longitudinal Valley in eastern Taiwan,Chen H;Lee J;Tung H;Chen C;Lee H,"To better characterize the vertical movements and the deformation behaviors across the plate suture of an arccontinent collision, we conducted annual repeated measurements on two precise leveling routes in a length of 34 and 37 km, respectively, across the middle part of the Longitudinal Valley in eastern Taiwan in 2004-2018. The 14-year-long results showed that the Longitudinal Valley fault (LVF) dominates the surface deformation: a) the middle LVF (Juisui fault) exhibited partially locked in the upper few kilometers, with a cumulative uplift rate of 9-10 mm/yr in a distance of 4 km; b) the southern LVF (Chihshang fault) showed a creeping behavior with a vertical rate of 24-27 mm/yr. In addition, we are able to characterize other features, including 1) tilting upward to the west in the eastern Central Range, suggesting activity on the west-dipping Central Range fault; 2) the hanging wall of the LVF showed tilting downward behavior to the east; 3) the Chimei fault, a suspected active fault, revealed active slip on the sub-vertical fault plane, that caused a vertical rate of 8-9 mm/yr. Putting the results under global ITRF system, the whole Juisui route was moving downward, supporting the notion that NNW subduction of the Philippine Sea plate starts around the latitude of the middle of the Longitudinal Valley. Finally, the co-seismic vertical deformation of the 2013 ML6.4 Juisui earthquake was characterized by tilting upward to the west, consistent with stick-slip on the deeper part of a west-dipping interface of the forearc basement.","Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.;  MOEA, Cent Geol Survey, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Changwon Natl Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Chang Won, South Korea.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;KOREA,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,5,1.0,1.0,"Lee, JC (corresponding author), Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.","Taiwan Earthquake Research Center (TEC); Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST)Ministry of Science and Technology, China [MOST106-2116-M-001-022, MOST 107-2116-M-001-001-026-MY3]","The authors would like to express their sincere thanks to many col-leagues who have devoted their efforts, at different time periods, to the field geodetic surveys for this 15yearlong study.

2014.0,J. Cult. Herit.,Using heritage risk maps as an approach to estimating the threat to materials of traditional buildings in Tainan Taiwan,Wu P;Hsieh C;Hsu M,"Academic studies concerning how climate influences Asian heritage are rare. The object of this study was to utilize the concept of heritage climatology together with a spatial analysis approach that includes respective climate parameter risks to cultural heritage sites. The study area, Tainan City, Taiwan, is in a subtropical zone south of the Tropic of Cancer. Tainan has nearly 300 hundred years of rich history and a multicultural background. This study used maps to gain information about potential climactic threats to Tainan's cultural-historical legacy. There are four kinds of map that use ArcGIS to analyse and demarcate regions not only by climate parameters but also by risk to heritage. These four types of map are climate maps, heritage climate maps, heritage maps and heritage risk maps. Climate maps give the short- to medium-term general status of the climate in Tainan City and thus served as the foundation of the other maps used in this study. Heritage climate maps give data concerning index factors that influence wood and stone materials. Heritage maps show locations of cultural heritage sites on an administrative map and categorize them according to their historic value. Heritage risk maps use accumulated calculations to superimpose the heritage climate map onto the heritage map in order to evaluate the risks to heritage sites in certain areas and categorize the levels of risk. Heritage sites in mountainous areas generally need to be protected from heavy rain, whereas downtown city environments, due to the urban heat island effect, require better protection against heat and cracking. By comparison of our field study results and climate risk maps, we found that in urban areas wooden materials have a higher risk of structural cracking, colour fading and bio-degradation, while coastal areas have a higher risk of weathering of stone materials.

Because the concepts of risk maps and cultural heritage preservation are relatively new in Taiwan, this study attempts to create a set of cultural heritage risk maps. Using flood as its primary disaster type and New Taipei City in northern Taiwan as its targeted area, this study first analyses disaster-prone areas using current global preservation approaches. Thematic analysis and field study are also used for analysis. Finally, based on cultural heritage vulnerability, the study examines present heritage preservation strategies and rediscovers the three aspects of ""sustainable management, disaster management, and climate change and adaptation"" in response to cultural heritage management. In addition, this study analyses the feasibility of using parks as water detention areas to reduce flood damage temporarily not only to cultural heritage areas but to human lives and property, as well.

2019.0,J. Cult. Herit.,Environmental risk mapping of physical cultural heritage using an unmanned aerial remote sensing system A case study of the HuangWei monument in Kinmen Taiwan,Su T,"Many studies have discussed the multiple risks to cultural heritage sites, however literature that discusses the threat of soil moisture penetrating into physical cultural heritage sites are extremely rare. In this paper, an unmanned aerial remote sensing system (UARSS) was employed to acquire images of the surroundings of the Huang-Wei monument, a physical cultural heritage site in Kinmen, Taiwan, which was coupled with a soil moisture examination in situ to produce thematic maps of soil moisture. The relationships among weather factors, including temperature, relative humidity, wind, and precipitation, as well as terrain factors, were analyzed to establish an environmental risk assessment model. A spatial analysis based on the environmental risk assessment model was implemented in a GIS environment to produce environmental risk maps for the Huang-Wei monument. A field survey demonstrated that the environmental risk maps were reliable and displayed the potential environmental risks to the Huang-Wei monument. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Earth Sci.,Links among Slope Morphology Canyon Types and Tectonics on Passive and Active Margins in the Northernmost South China Sea,Yu H;Chang E,"We examine slope profile types and variations in slope gradient and slope relief with depth for both passive and active margins in the northern most South China Sea. The passive South China margin is characterized by an exponential slope profile, mainly associated with clustered slope-confined canyons. The active Taiwan margin shows a linear-like shape with great variations along the lower slope. Fewer canyons occur on the Taiwan margin, and hence the influence of canyon incision on slope morphology is relatively less significant. Quantitative analyses of slope curvature, slope gradient and square root of relief variance are useful statistical parameters to explain characteristics and variability of morphology of the slope of the South China margin, but not for the Kaoping slope on the Taiwan side. On the active Taiwan margin, tectonic activities are dominant over sediment deposition and surface erosion, producing a slope profile quite different from those of passive margins of the Middle Atlantic, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa where failure on slope and accompanying canyon incision are the dominant processes shaping the slope morphology.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, Taipei 10764, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,,"Yu, HS (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, Taipei 10764, Taiwan.","National Science Council, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","This study was supported by the National Science Council, Taiwan.",slope morphology; canyon; statistical analysis; continental margin; South China Sea,10.1007/s12583-009-0008-1,Article,KAOPING SUBMARINE-CANYON; CONTINENTAL-SLOPE; SOUTHWESTERN TAIWAN; SW TAIWAN; CLASSIFICATION; CURVATURE,"CHINA UNIV GEOSCIENCES, WUHAN",JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCE,9,20,ISI,NATL TAIWAN UNIV,NATL TAIWAN UNIV,A
2013.0,J. Earth Sci.,Taiwan ChiChi Earthquake Precursor Detection Using Nonlinear Principal Component Analysis to MultiChannel Total Electron Content Records,Lin J,"This research uses eigenvalue characteristics of nonlinear principal component analysis (NLPCA) and principal component analysis (PCA) to investigate total electron content (TEC) anomalies associated with Taiwan's Chi-Chi earthquake of 21 September 1999 (LT) (M-w=7.6). The transforms are used for ionospheric TEC from 01 August to 20 September 1999 (local time) using data from 13 GPS receivers. The data were collected at 22 degrees N-26 degrees N Lat. and 120 degrees E-122 degrees E Long.. Applying the NLPCA to the multi-channel total electron content records of GPS receivers, the earthquake-associated TEC anomalies were represented by large principal eigenvalues of NLPCA (>0.5 in a normalized set) on 14 August and 17, 18, and 20 September, with allowance given for the Dst index, which was quiet for the study period. Comparisons were then made with other researchers who also found TEC anomalies on September 17, 18, and 19 associated with the Chi-Chi earthquake, which cannot be detected by PCA. Consideration is also given for reported ground level geomagnetic field activity that occurred between mid-August and late October, leading up to and including the Chi-Chi and Chia-Yi earthquakes, which are associated with the same series of faults. It is possible that Aug. 14 is representative of an earthquake-associated TEC anomaly. This is an interesting result given how much earlier than the earthquake it occurred.","Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.;  Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Inst Geosci, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,1,1.0,,"Lin, JW (corresponding author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Earth Sci, 1 Univ Rd, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.",,,nonlinear principal component analysis; principal component analysis; multi-channel total electron content records; Taiwan's Chi-Chi earthquake,10.1007/s12583-013-0325-2,Article,SEISMO-IONOSPHERIC ANOMALIES; WENCHUAN EARTHQUAKE; PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; GPS-TEC; SIGNALS; FIELD; MAGNITUDE,CHINA UNIV GEOSCIENCES,JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCE,6,24,ISI,NATL CHENG KUNG UNIV;NATL CHENG KUNG UNIV,NATL CHENG KUNG UNIV,A
2016.0,J. Earth Sci.,Fractal analysis of rainfallinduced landslide and debris flow spread distribution in the Chenyulan Creek Basin Taiwan,Yang Z;Pourghasemi H;Lee Y,"The Chenyulan Stream in Central Taiwan follows the Chenyulan fault line which is a major boundary fault in Taiwan. In recent years, many destructive landslides have occurred in the Chenyulan Creek Basin after heavy rainfall accompanied by several strong typhoons. Three examples of landslide distributions in the Chenyulan Creek Basin, before and after 1996 and after 2004 are analyzed. The box dimension and two-point correlation dimension are employed to describe the landslide area size distribution and distance distribution between every two landslides, respectively. It is found that the number of landslides increased in this period. However, the average landslide area decreased. The correlation dimension gradually increased from 1.15 to 1.32 during this period (before and after 1996 and after 2004). This implies that the landslide distribution in the Chenyulan Creek Basin has become diffuse and extensive. The box dimension value shows the degree of the landslide density occupied in a space. The box dimension also increased from 0.3 to 0.69 during this period. The increasing box dimension means that the landslide presented in this creek basin has gradually increased. This indicates that the slopes of this creek basin have become more unstable and susceptible.","Tamkang Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Shiraz Univ, Coll Agr, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Engn, Shiraz, Iran.;",TAIWAN;IRAN,TAIWAN,IRAN,3,1.0,1.0,"Pourghasemi, HR (corresponding author), Shiraz Univ, Coll Agr, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Engn, Shiraz, Iran.","NSCMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [102-2221-E-032-043-MY3]",This study was supported by NSC (No. 102-2221-E-032-043-MY3).

The data collected from profiler radar was used to investigate the impact of typhoon on generating waves and other atmospheric disturbances. Result showed that the typhoon and the associated wind disturbances can generate atmospheric waves with varied periodicity even when the core was far away from the land. The waves were quite prominent when the core was closer to the mountain. Observations show that these waves propagate vertically upward for many kilometers and getting trapped in higher altitudes. The radar reflectivity at the tropopause during the event showed that stable layer structure was very weak. Further, the enhancement in ozone measurement at the ground level was observed when the typhoon was near to radar site.","Indian Space Res Org, ISTRAC, Bangalore 560058, Karnataka, India.;  Natl Cent Univ, Inst Space Sci, Chungli 32054, Taiwan.;  Sri Venkateswara Univ, Dept Phys, Tirupati 517502, Andhra Pradesh, India.;",INDIA;TAIWAN;INDIA,INDIA,INDIA,4,2.0,,"Anandan, VK (corresponding author), Indian Space Res Org, ISTRAC, Bangalore 560058, Karnataka, India.",,,Typhoon; atmospheric waves; tropopause; radar remote sensing; meteorology and atmospheric dynamics,10.1007/s12040-013-0293-z,Article,DEEP TROPICAL CONVECTION; INTERNAL GRAVITY-WAVES; INDIAN MST RADAR; THUNDERSTORM; STRATOSPHERE; PROPAGATION; TROPOPAUSE; IMPACT; OZONE; VHF,INDIAN ACAD SCIENCES,JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE,0,122,ISI,INDIAN SPACE RES ORG;NATL CENT UNIV;SRI VENKATESWARA UNIV,VK (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR),A

2013.0,J. Earth Syst. Sci.,Using artificial neural network approach for modelling rainfallrunoff due to typhoon,Chen S;Wang Y;Tsou I,"In Taiwan, owing to the nonuniform temporal and spatial distribution of rainfall and high mountains all over the country, hydrologic systems are very complex. Therefore, preventing and controlling flood disasters is imperative. Nevertheless, water level and flow records are essential in hydrological analysis for designing related water works of flood management. Due to the complexity of the hydrological process, reliable runoff is hardly predicted by applying linear and non-linear regression methods. Therefore, in this study, a model for estimating runoff by using rainfall data from a river basin is developed and a neural network technique is employed to recover missing data. For achieving the objectives, hourly rainfall and flow data from Nanhe, Taiwu, and Laii rainfall stations and Sinpi flow station in the Linbien basin are used. The data records were of 27 typhoons between the years 2005 and 2009. The feed forward back propagation network (FFBP) and conventional regression analysis (CRA) were employed to study their performances. From the statistical evaluation, it has been found that the performance of FFBP exceeded that of regression analysis as reflected by the determination coefficients R (2), which were 0.969 and 0.284 for FFBP and CRA, respectively.","Natl Pingtung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Neipu Hsiang 91201, Pingtung, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,,"Wang, YM (corresponding author), Natl Pingtung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Neipu Hsiang 91201, Pingtung, Taiwan.","NSC TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [NSC101-2625-M-020-003]",The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from NSC Taiwan under the grant of NSC101-2625-M-020-003.,Feed forward back propagation network; river flow; typhoon; rainfall; runoff,10.1007/s12040-013-0289-8,Article,HYBRID GENETIC ALGORITHM,INDIAN ACAD SCIENCES,JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE,32,122,ISI,NATL PINGTUNG UNIV SCI AND TECHNOL,NATL PINGTUNG UNIV SCI AND TECHNOL,A
2014.0,J. Earth Syst. Sci.,GIS and SBF for estimating groundwater recharge of a mountainous basin in the Wu River watershed Taiwan,Yeh H;Lin H;Lee S;Chang M;Hsu K;Lee C,"The temporal and spatial distributions of precipitation are extremely uneven; so, careful management of water resources in Taiwan is crucial. The long-term overexploitation of groundwater resources poses a challenge to water resource management in Taiwan. However, assessing groundwater resources in mountainous basins is challenging due to limited information. In this study, a geographic information system (GIS) and stable base-flow (SBF) techniques were used to assess the characteristics of groundwater recharge considering the Wu River watershed in central Taiwan as a study area. First, a GIS approach was used to integrate five contributing factors: lithology, land cover/land use, lineaments, drainage, and slope. The weights of factors contributing to the groundwater recharge were obtained from aerial photos, geological maps, a land use database, and field verification. Second, the SBF was used to estimate the groundwater recharge in a mountainous basin scale. The concept of the SBF technique was to separate the base-flow from the total streamflow discharge in order to obtain a measure of groundwater recharge. The SBF technique has the advantage of integrating groundwater recharge across an entire basin without complex hydro-geologic modelling and detailed knowledge of the soil characteristics. In this study, our approach for estimating recharge provides not only an estimate of how much water becomes groundwater, but also explains the characteristics of a potential groundwater recharge zone.","Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Resources Engn, Tainan 701, Taiwan.;  Cent Geol Survey, Minist Econ Affairs, New Taipei 235, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,6,1.0,,"Lee, CH (corresponding author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Resources Engn, Tainan 701, Taiwan.","National Science Council (NSC), Taiwan, R.O.C.Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [NSC 101-2221-E-006-196-MY2]; Central Geological Survey of Taiwan [101-5226904000-02-02]","The authors are very grateful to three anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments in greatly improving the manuscript.

2014.0,J. Earth Syst. Sci.,Spatial distribution of soil erosion and suspended sediment transport rate for ChouShui river basin,Lin C;Chen C;Wang Y;Tsai C;Tsai C,"In this study, a Physiographic Soil Erosion-Deposition Model (PSED) is applied for better management of a watershed. The PSED model can effectively evaluate the key parameters of watershed management: surface runoff discharge, suspended sediment transport rate, quantity of soil erosion, and spatial distribution of soil erosion and deposition. A basin usually contains multiple watersheds. These watersheds may have complex topography and heterogeneous physiographic properties. The PSED model, containing a physiographic rainfall-runoff model and a basin scale erosion-deposition model, can simulate the physical mechanism of the entire erosion process based on a detailed calculation of bed-load transportation, surface soil entrainment, and the deposition mechanism. With the assistance of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), the PSED model can handle and analyze extremely large hydrologic and physiographic datasets and simulate the physical erosion process without the need for simplification. We verified the PSED model using three typhoon events and 40 rainfall events. The application of PSED to Chou-Shui River basin shows that the PSED model can accurately estimate discharge hydrographs, suspended sediment transport rates, and sediment yield. Additionally, we obtained reasonable quantities of soil erosion as well as the spatial distribution of soil erosion and deposition. The results show that the PSED model is capable of calculating spatially distributed soil erosion and suspended sediment transport rates for a basin with multiple watersheds even if these watersheds have complex topography and heterogeneous physiographic properties. © Indian Academy of Sciences.","Department of Civil Engineering, National Pingtung University of Science and Technology, Pingtung, Taiwan; International Master’s Program of Soil and Water Engg, National Pingtung University of Science and Technology, Pingtung, Taiwan; Department of Information Communication, University of Kang Ning, No. 188, Sec. 5, Anzhong Road, Tainan, 70970, Taiwan; Department of Hydraulics and Ocean Engineering, National Cheng-Kung University, No. 1, University Road, Tainan City, 70101, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,5,1.0,,"Wang, Y.-M.; Department of Civil Engineering, Taiwan",,NA NA NA NA,Physiographic soil erosion-deposition model (PSED);  Sediment yield;  Spatially distributed soil erosion;  Suspended sediment transport rate,10.1007/s12040-014-0484-2,Article,deposition;  GIS;  rainfall-runoff modeling;  river basin;  sediment transport;  sediment yield;  soil erosion;  spatial distribution;  suspended sediment;  watershed; Choushui Basin;  Taiwan,Indian Academy of Sciences,Journal of Earth System Science,5,123,scopus,NATIONAL PINGTUNG UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY;NATIONAL PINGTUNG UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY;UNIVERSITY OF KANG NING;NATIONAL CHENG-KUNG UNIVERSITY,NOTREPORTED,A

Sci.,Development of roughness updating based on artificial neural network in a river hydraulic model for flash flood forecasting,Fu J;Hsu M;Duann Y,Flood is the worst weather-related hazard in Taiwan because of steep terrain and storm. The tropical storm often results in disastrous flash flood. To provide reliable forecast of water stages in rivers is indispensable for proper actions in the emergency response during flood. The river hydraulic model based on dynamic wave theory using an implicit finite-difference method is developed with river roughness updating for flash flood forecast. The artificial neural network (ANN) is employed to update the roughness of rivers in accordance with the observed river stages at each time-step of the flood routing process. Several typhoon events at Tamsui River are utilized to evaluate the accuracy of flood forecasting.

2016.0,J. Earth Syst. Sci.,Influence of storm magnitude and watershed size on runoff nonlinearity,Lee K;Huang J,"The inherent nonlinear characteristics of the watershed runoff process related to storm magnitude and watershed size are discussed in detail in this study. The first type of nonlinearity is referred to rainfall-runoff dynamic process and the second type is with respect to a Power-law relation between peak discharge and upstream drainage area. The dynamic nonlinearity induced by storm magnitude was first demonstrated by inspecting rainfall-runoff records at three watersheds in Taiwan. Then the derivation of the watershed unit hydrograph (UH) using two linear hydrological models shows that the peak discharge and time to peak discharge that characterize the shape of UH vary event-to-event. Hence, the intention of deriving a unique and universal UH for all rainfall-runoff simulation cases is questionable. In contrast, the UHs by the other two adopted nonlinear hydrological models were responsive to rainfall intensity without relying on linear proportion principle, and are excellent in presenting dynamic nonlinearity. Based on the two-segment regression, the scaling nonlinearity between peak discharge and drainage area was investigated by analyzing the variation of Power-law exponent. The results demonstrate that the scaling nonlinearity is particularly significant for a watershed having larger area and subjecting to a small-size of storm. For three study watersheds, a large tributary that contributes relatively great drainage area or inflow is found to cause a transition break in scaling relationship and convert the scaling relationship from linearity to nonlinearity.","Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Dept River & Harbor Engn, Keelung 202, Taiwan.;  Taiwan Typhoon & Flood Res Inst, Natl Appl Res Lab, Taipei 100, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,1.0,"Huang, JK (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Dept River & Harbor Engn, Keelung 202, Taiwan.","National Science Council, Taiwan, R.O.CMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [103-2811-M-019-007]; National Science CouncilMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","This research was supported by the National Science Council, Taiwan, R.O.C under grant 103-2811-M-019-007.

2018.0,J. Earth Syst. Sci.,Application of Persistent Scatterer Interferometry PSI in monitoring slope movements in Nainital Uttarakhand Lesser Himalaya India,Yhokha A;Goswami P;Chang C;Yen J;Ching K;Aruche K,"Orogenic movements and sub-tropical climate have rendered the slopes of the Himalayan region intensely deformed and weathered. As a result, the incidences of slope failure are quite common all along the Himalayan region. The Lesser Himalayan terrane is particularly vulnerable to mass-movements owing to geological fragility, and many parts of it are bearing a high-risk of associated disaster owing to the high population density. An important step towards mitigation of such disasters is the monitoring of slope movement. Towards this, the Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) technique can be applied. In the present study, the PSI technique is employed in Lesser Himalayan town of Nainital in Uttarakhand state of India to decipher and monitor slope movements. A total of 15 multi-date ENVISAT ASAR satellite images, acquired during August 2008 to August 2010 period, were subjected to PSI, which revealed a continuous creep movement along the hillslopes located towards the eastern side of the Nainital lake. The higher reaches of the hill seem to be experiencing accelerated creep of similar to 21mm/year, which decreases downslope to similar to 5mm/year. Based on spatial pattern of varying PSI Mean LOS Velocity (MLV) values, high (H), moderate (M), low (L) and very low (S) creeping zones have been delineated in the hillslopes. Given the long history of mass movements and continuously increasing anthropogenic activities in Nainital, these results call for immediate measures to avert any future disaster in the town.","Natl Cent Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Taoyuan, Taiwan.;  Natl Cent Univ, Inst Geophys, Taoyuan, Taiwan.;  Kumaun Univ, Dept Geol, Ctr Adv Study, Naini Tal, India.;  Natl Cent Univ, Ctr Space & Remote Sensing Res, Taoyuan, Taiwan.;  Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Dept Nat Resource & Environm Studies, Hualien, Taiwan.;  Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Geomat, Tainan, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;INDIA;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,INDIA,6,1.0,,"Goswami, PK (corresponding author), Kumaun Univ, Dept Geol, Ctr Adv Study, Naini Tal, India.","Department of Science and Technology, Govt. of IndiaDepartment of Science & Technology (India); Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [NSC 10102923-M-008-002]; MOST [MOST103-2116-M-259-002]; ESAEuropean Space Agency [CIP. 9519]","The authors are thankful to the Department of Science and Technology, Govt. of India and Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Taiwan for funding the present work as a part of Indo-Taiwan Joint Research Program (Grant No. NSC 10102923-M-008-002) and other individual project with MOST (Project No. MOST103-2116-M-259-002).

2019.0,J. Earth Syst. Sci.,Investigating suspendedsediment transport in a shallow lake using a threedimensional hydrodynamic and sediment model,Liu W;Liu H;Chiu C,"A three-dimensional, unstructured-grid hydrodynamic and suspended-sediment transport model was developed to simulate the temporal and spatial variations of suspended sediment and was applied to the subtropical subalpine Tsuei-Feng Lake (TFL) of Taiwan. The model was validated with measured water level and suspended-sediment concentration in 2009, 2010 and 2011. The overall model simulation results are in quantitative agreement with the observational data. The validated model was then applied to explore the most important parameter that affects the suspended-sediment concentration and to investigate the effect of wind stress on the mean current and suspended-sediment distribution in this shallow lake. Modelling results of the sensitivity analysis revealed that the settling velocity is a crucial parameter and the erosion rate is less important in the suspended-sediment transport model. Remarkable lake circulation was found based on the strength of wind speed and wind direction. A strong wind would result in a higher mean current in the top layer and suspended-sediment distribution in the top and bottom layers. This study demonstrated that wind stress played a significant influence on mean circulation and suspended-sediment transport in a shallow lake.","Natl United Univ, Dept Civil & Disaster Prevent Engn, Miaoli 36063, Taiwan.;  Acad Sinica, Res Ctr Biodivers, Taipei 11529, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,,"Liu, WC (corresponding author), Natl United Univ, Dept Civil & Disaster Prevent Engn, Miaoli 36063, Taiwan.","Academia Sinica, TaiwanAcademia Sinica - Taiwan [AS-103-TP-B15]; Ministry of Science and Technology, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 105-2625-M-865-002]","This research was founded by the Academia Sinica, Taiwan (No. AS-103-TP-B15) and the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan (MOST 105-2625-M-865-002).

2021.0,J. Earth Syst. Sci.,A comparison of atmospheric geochemistry through lichens from volcanic and nonvolcanic areas north Taiwan,Lin L;Lu H;Pi J;Liou T;Chen W;Hsieh P,"Lichens are abundant with functional groups that are capable of adsorbing dissolved metals in moisture and intercepting suspended particles in the atmosphere. Using lichen chemistry as an indicator is a prominent method of assessing a long-term baseline of atmospheric quality. This study collected foliose lichens, Parmelia sp., from an area with intensive post-volcanic activity (Tatun Volcano Group) and a deep mountain trail (Nan-ao Trail) in northern Taiwan. The geochemical results show that the lichens from Nan-ao have much higher enrichment factors (EFs) for most metals than those from the Tatun Volcano Group, which revealed that the geochemistry of Nan-ao lichens is dominated by interception of suspended particles rather than absorption of lichen surface. In addition, the fact that no Eu-negative anomaly (Eu/Eu* approximate to 1.0) can be observed in the normalized patterns of rare earth elements of lichens from Nan-ao reconBrms the derivation. In contrast, lichens from the Tatun Volcano Group are characterized by lower enrichment factors of metals, evident from Ce-negative and Eu-positive anomalies (Ce/Ce* < 0.6 and Eu/Eu* > 1.0), which implies that the lichen chemistry may be principally established by the chemical adsorption of functional groups on the lichen surface. In addition, the extraordinary enrichment factors of Ca, Mg, Na, and K of lichens near the northern coast (EF > 10) prove the involvement of seawater aerosol on the atmospheric chemistry. The lead isotopic compositions reveal that unleaded gasoline could be the dominant source of lead for Nan-ao lichens (Pb-207/Pb-206 > 0.86 and Pb-208/Pb-206 < 2.105), while the local andesite provides the lead to lichens from the Tatun Volcano Group. However, the Tatun Volcano Group is very close to Taipei City, with all kinds of anthropogenic activities, which also contribute a considerable amount of lead to the atmosphere.","Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Chiayi, Taiwan.;  SUNY Buffalo, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Buffalo, NY USA.;  Chia Nan Univ Pharm & Sci, Dept Tourism & Management, Tainan, Taiwan.;  Ind Technol Res Inst, Green Energy & Environm Res Labs, Hsinchu, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;USA;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,6,1.0,,"Lu, HY (corresponding author), Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Chiayi, Taiwan.","National Science Council, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST106-2116-M-194-001-]","This study is supported by research grants from the National Science Council, Taiwan (MOST106-2116-M-194-001-).",Northern Taiwan; lichens as bioindicators; rare earth elements; lead isotopes,10.1007/s12040-021-01724-w,Article,RARE-EARTH-ELEMENTS; POSTCOLLISIONAL MAGMATISM; EPIPHYTIC LICHENS; NITROGEN-DIOXIDE; METAL POLLUTION; SULFUR-DIOXIDE; AIR-POLLUTION; LEAD ISOTOPES; SW GERMANY; REE,INDIAN ACAD SCIENCES,JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE,0,130,ISI,NATL CHUNG CHENG UNIV;SUNY BUFFALO;CHIA NAN UNIV PHARM AND SCI;IND TECHNOL RES INST,NATL CHUNG CHENG UNIV,A

To achieve this goal, the nonparametric Kendall trend test was implemented for identifying appropriate rainfall lag times, and then the multistep-ahead flood forecasting was carried out by the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS)-based hydrological models with different input combinations. Hydrological data collected during 13 typhoon events in the Shihmen Reservoir watershed of Taiwan were used to train and validate the forecasting models. Results reveal that rainfall and inflow had similar patterns with a time shift of 5 up to 7 h, and the ANFIS-based model with inputs that involved effective time-delayed rainfall identified by the Kendall trend test performed better than the other comparative models. Results demonstrate that accurate inflow forecasts can be achieved up to a lead time of 5 h, which is very valuable information on real-time reservoir operation for flood control.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Bioenvironm Syst Engn, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,1.0,"Chang, FJ (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Bioenvironm Syst Engn, 1 Sec 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.","National Science Council, Taiwan, ROCMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [100-2313-B-002-011-MY3]","This paper was partially sponsored by the National Science Council, Taiwan, ROC.

A comparative study was first conducted to validate the model; the simulated results excellently agree with the field measurement concerning inundated depth and area during Typhoons Haitang and Kalmaegi. The model was then applied to calculate the corresponding potential inundation, inundated area, and inundated risk in a flood-prone coastal zone under design rainfall of seven return periods (2-year, 5-year, 10-year, 20-year, 50-year, 100-year, and 200-year) and the given hydrograph of storm surge. The simulated result indicates that 7.59% of the study area is under flooding when the return period is 2-year and the ratio increases to 10.16% when the return period is 200-year. Moreover, the ratio of the inundated area where the inundated depth is greater than 1 m to the total inundated area increases with an increase in the return period. It can be also found that more severe inundation arises in the lagoon and estuary together with both sides of tidal reach of rivers which also have higher inundated depth and risk.","Natl Pingtung Univ Sci & Technol, Int Master Program Soil & Water Engn, Neipu 912, Pingtung, Taiwan.;  Univ Kang Ning, Dept Informat Commun, Tainan, Taiwan.;  Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Hydraul & Ocean Engn, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,4,1.0,1.0,"Chen, CN (corresponding author), Natl Pingtung Univ Sci & Technol, Int Master Program Soil & Water Engn, 1 Shuefu Rd, Neipu 912, Pingtung, Taiwan.","Water Resources Agency, Ministry of Economic Affairs, Taiwan","This work was supported by the Water Resources Agency, Ministry of Economic Affairs, Taiwan.",Coastal zone; flood modelling; physiographic inundation model; potential inundation,10.1111/jfr3.12088,Article,TAIWAN; SYSTEM; FLOOD,WILEY-BLACKWELL,JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT,7,8,ISI,NATL PINGTUNG UNIV SCI AND TECHNOL;UNIV KANG NING;NATL CHENG KUNG UNIV,NATL PINGTUNG UNIV SCI AND TECHNOL,B2

The model integrates a flash flood routing model (FFRM) coupled with an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) and an artificial neural network (ANN) submodel. In the model, the ANN forecasts river water stages at gauge stations first. Then, these are used as the initial and boundary conditions of the FFRM. The water stages, simulated from the FFRM, are then corrected by the EnKF for lead time. The model was applied to the Tanshui River watershed in northern Taiwan during past typhoons. The model forecasts almost covered the data observed during a typhoon period to within 95% confidence intervals. Compared with the use of FFRM without EnKF, the forecast water stages from the EnKF improved the accuracy at the conjunctions between upstream and downstream channels and the steep slope location.","Natl Sci & Technol Ctr Disaster Reduct, New Taipei, Taiwan.;  Natl United Univ, Civil & Disaster Prevent Engn, 1 Lienda, Miaoli, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Bioenvironm Syst Engn, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Kyushu Univ, Adv Study, Fukuoka, Japan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;JAPAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,6,1.0,1.0,"Hsu, MH (corresponding author), Natl United Univ, Civil & Disaster Prevent Engn, 1 Lienda, Miaoli, Taiwan.","Taiwan National Science CouncilMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [NSC 99-2811-E-002-113]",This project was funded by the Taiwan National Science Council (Grant No. NSC 99-2811-E-002-113).

This paper presents a study of groundwater- pumping management for mitigating flood hazard in a subsidence infested area in the southwest coast of Taiwan. An optimal groundwater-pumping model is developed for preventing flood hazard from worsening and for satisfying the groundwater demand. In an area where the land is susceptible to pumping-induced subsidence, the study shows that proper long-term pumping strategy to manage spatial-temporal variation of future land subsidence should be an integral part of flood risk management as it can sustain the effectiveness of the flood mitigation measures.","Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Disaster Prevent & Water Environm Res Ctr, Hsinchu, Taiwan.;  Natl Chiayi Univ, Dept Civil & Water Resources Engn, Chiayi, Taiwan.;  Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Hsinchu, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,,"Chang, YL (corresponding author), Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Disaster Prevent & Water Environm Res Ctr, Hsinchu, Taiwan.","Water Resources Planning Institute, Water Resources Agency, Ministry of Economic Affairs, Taiwan [MOEAWRA1020238]","Water Resources Planning Institute, Water Resources Agency, Ministry of Economic Affairs, Taiwan, Grant/Award Number: MOEAWRA1020238",flood hazard; groundwater management; land subsidence; optimization,10.1111/jfr3.12517,Article,INUNDATION; RISK,WILEY,JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT,1,12,ISI,NATL CHIAO TUNG UNIV;NATL CHIAYI UNIV;NATL CHIAO TUNG UNIV,NATL CHIAO TUNG UNIV,A
2021.0,J. Flood Risk Manag.,Identifying critical risk factors and responses of river dredging projects for knowledge management within organisation,Chou J;Chiu Y,"A river exhibits strong upstream erosion and rapid downstream accumulation. Dredging is one of the methods that is most commonly adopted by the Taiwan Water Resources Agency (WRA) to ensure the smooth flow of rivers and their ability to discharge water, protecting lives and property from flood disasters. However, dredging projects are large, involving very many stakeholders, leading to high uncertainty in the implementation of the project. The WRA also lacks relevant risk management methods and countermeasures owing to the periodical brain drain and retirement within the organisation. In order to enhance risk management for dredging engineers, river management offices across the country were visited, and knowledge and experience of dredging engineering were obtained using expert meetings and scientific methods. Work was carried out with the WRA to identify six major risk categories for dredging projects, covering 30 risks. An Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) questionnaire was developed using the Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS), and a Risk Impact/Frequency Analysis (RIFA) questionnaire was developed using the Important/Performance Analysis (IPA) method; these were answered by 69 engineers with experience in river dredging. Finally, critical risk factors are identified and ranked by combining the responses to the questionnaires and in the interviews, helping engineers with risk management in the future. Research results demonstrate that most of the engineering management experience in practice is communicated by word of mouth, with no effective and systematic method of knowledge management. Therefore, a knowledge-based system is created, covering 170 risk events and solutions for various dredging projects, and a graphical user information system is built in a programming language, to enable the WRA to save engineering experience systematically for future exploitation.","Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Construct Engn, Taipei, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,,"Chou, JS (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Construct Engn, Taipei, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and Technology, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [108-2221-E-011-003-MY3]","The authors would like to thank the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, for financially supporting this research under contract 108-2221-E-011-003-MY3.",critical risk factors; dredging engineering project; flood management; knowledge management; risk identification and flood mitigation; risk response; river restoration,10.1111/jfr3.12690,Article,IMPORTANCE-PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS; CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; SAFETY; EXTENSION; PRIORITY; AHP,WILEY,JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT,0,14,ISI,NATL TAIWAN UNIV SCI AND TECHNOL,NATL TAIWAN UNIV SCI AND TECHNOL,A
2020.0,J. Foraminifer. Res.,CYCLOHELENINA FORMOSAENSIS GEN NOV ET SP NOV A NEW BENTHIC FORAMINIFER FROM SOUTHERN TAIWAN,Chien C;Chang Y;Yang K,"A new benthic foraminiferal genus and species of Heleninidae was discovered in estuarine sediments of the Sihchong River, western Hengchun Peninsula, Southern Taiwan. Similar to the resembling genus Helenina, Cyclohelenina gen. nov. displays distinct sutural incisions on both spiral and umbilical sides. However, it exhibits relatively coarser perforation of the wall, more roundness along the equatorial outline, and a wider range in the number of chambers (7-10) in the last whorl compared to other Heleninidae genera. This new genus can provide a suitable taxonomical unit for the assignments of several undetermined species that were previously classified to but distinguishable from the genera ""Pseudoeponides"" and Helenina. In this research, we examined and measured 58 syntypes and one ideotype (from the Kangkou River on the east flank of Hengchun Peninsula) of Cyclohelenina formosaensis sp. nov., the type species of the new genus. Under the concept of functional morphology, the hispid ornamentation found to be present around every opening on the test of C. formosaensis suggests that it may be an herbivore. Observations of yellowish-green stains within fresh tests (evidence for chlorophyll from their food source) are consistent with this inference. The test with low-trochospiral shape and sutural incisions on both sides indicated that C. formosaensis may prefer hyposaline habitats with sandy silt and sand substrates in tideinfluenced environments, which is consistent with environment properties of the type locality of the new species.","Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Tainan, Taiwan.;  Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Oceanog, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,,"Chien, CW (corresponding author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Tainan, Taiwan.",,,,,Article,,CUSHMAN FOUNDATION FORAMINIFERAL RESEARCH,JOURNAL OF FORAMINIFERAL RESEARCH,2,50,ISI,NATL CHENG KUNG UNIV;NATL SUN YAT SEN UNIV,NATL CHENG KUNG UNIV,A
2004.0,J. Geochem. Explor.,Mercury as a useful pathfinder for the Chinkuashih enargitegold deposits Taiwan,Fang J;Tan L;Yu B,"The Chinkuashih is a group of dacite-related hydrothermal enargite-gold deposits of the Quaternary age, which produced 94 tons of gold and 119, 101 tons of copper from 1895 to 1987. It has remaining reserves of 656 tons of gold with an average grade range of 1.5-3.5 g/ton of Au for all orebodies discovered. Mercury content in different media such as stream sediments, heavy minerals in stream sediments, soils, rocks/ores, and pyrite samples was analyzed by a gold-film mercury detector to evaluate whether mercury is a good pathfinder for these types of deposits at Chinkuashih. The gold film technique is more rapid and cheaper than the traditional fire assay or fire assay/ICP-MS gold and trace element analyses. Mercury in stream sediments and soils indicated the border zone of gold mineralization 12 kin away from the center of mineralization at Chinkuashih. Mercury in heavy minerals of the stream sediments distinguished the intermediate zone with gold veins and gold/gold-copper breccia pipes from the core or inner zone with the gold-copper zone. It has been found that contours of 1000 or 500 ppb Hg of soil samples can delineate the outcropping gold orebodies. The gold ores generally contain 1000 ppb or more Hg. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

2010.0,J. Geochem. Explor.,Applying scores of multivariate statistical analyses to characterize relationships between hydrochemical properties and geological origins of springs in Taiwan,Jang C,"This work used scores of multivariate statistical analyses, factor analysis (FA) and discriminant analysis (DA), to characterize relationships between hydrochemical properties and geological origins of springs in Taiwan. Factor analysis was first used to examine major hydrochemical patterns of springs. Moreover, according to springs emerging from acid-sulfate and neutral-sulfate igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks, DA was then adopted to establish a linear classification model using hydrochemical data on springs. Finally, scores of FA and DA were applied to explore statistically common hydrochemical features of springs based on their geological origins. Key components of hydrochemical parameters, which were capable of differentiating among geological groups, were proposed to interpret likely formation processes of springs. The analyzed results indicate that spring waters emerging from neutral-sulfate igneous rock contain abundant Ca(2+) concentrations and obviously differ from those from the other rocks owing to the process of dedolomitization. Spring waters emerging from acid-sulfate igneous rock are high temperatures, large quantities of aqueous SiO(2) and low pH. Spring waters emerging from sedimentary rock are rich in Cl(-), HCO(3)(-) and Na(+) concentrations and low temperatures. Furthermore, spring waters emerging from metamorphic rock contain less ions than those from the other rocks do, except for HCO(3)(-). (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

2010.0,J. Geochem. Explor.,Physical and chemical characteristics of the host rocks in controlling the mineralization of the Chinkuashih highsulfidation goldcopper deposits northeastern Taiwan,Wang Y,"Epithermal high-sulfidation gold-copper deposits at the Chinkuashih area in northeastern Taiwan occur both within Pleistocene andesite and Miocene sedimentary rocks. Spatially associated Penshan and Shumei deposits of a major gold-copper vein, the ""Main Vein"", were both mineralized along an extended normal fault zone. These deposits appear to have formed from the same original hydrothermal fluids, but in different host rock types. However, the results of trace element analyses indicate that the andesite-hosted Penshan deposit has distinctly higher ore-metal and lower LREE contents than the sediment-hosted Shumei deposit. The development of higher grade ore at Penshan deposit resulted from the presence of ferrous Fe-rich minerals in andesite that caused the deposition of a larger amount of pyrite and gold during the sulfidation-reduction reactions of acidic fluid with host rocks. Moreover, the porous-permeable silicic alteration facies of the Penshan deposit provided conduits for the circulation of ore-metal bearing fluids and the trapping of metal-bearing magmatic volatile to precipitate ore minerals. On the other hand, the higher LREE contents of the Shumei open pit reflect the low pH and abundance of mainly SO42- ion in the hydrothermal fluid perhaps because sedimentary host rocks were not able to neutralize and to reduce the acidic fluid effectively through the reactions of fluid and host rocks. Moreover, the Fe-poor host rocks have lower capacity to consume H2S and precipitate pyrite and gold. In addition, the circulation of ore-metal bearing fluids and trapping of metal-bearing magmatic volatile to precipitate ore minerals could be handicapped by the low permeability and porosity of the silicified sedimentary rocks. It is apparent from these observations that physical and chemical characteristics of host rocks are important factors in controlling the ore grade of the Chinkuashih high-sulfidation gold-copper deposits.

Explor.,Sources of major ions and heavy metals in rainwater associated with typhoon events in southwestern Taiwan,Cheng M;You C,"Dissolved chemical compositions in rainwater have provided valuable information on pollutant sources in the atmosphere and short-term environmental changes. However, baseline chemical data associated with typhoon is rather limited. In this study, a suite of time-series rain specimens including four typhoon events are collected from Tainan city, southern Taiwan and analyzed for major ions, heavy metals and Pb isotopes to elucidate mechanisms causing dissolved components variation in rainwater and to understand how heavy metals are transported by air-mass along typhoon pathways. Being different from previous views, dissolved major ions and heavy metals in typhoon rains show high concentration and large variability compared with normal period. In particular, dissolved Ni, Cu and Pb change more than several hundred times during typhoon events. This agrees with a scenario that typhoons disturb surface environments and enhance particles scavenged from anthropogenic sites along air-mass pathways. The Pb-206/Pb-207 ratios are significantly low in high Pb contents specimens, which are mostly associated with high precipitation and confirm local anthropogenic sources due to intense water-particle interaction. In particular, the Cu and Pb fluxes increase >10,000 and >10,000,000 times respectively during typhoon events and thus impact importantly the chemical budgets of these metals in coastal ocean. Combining backward trajectories and PCA results demonstrates consistently that air-mass routes dictate critically the dissolved chemical characteristics in rains; furthermore, it highlights the importance of migration pathways to heavy metals distribution in typhoon rainwater.

2012.0,J. Geochem. Explor.,The binding nature of humic substances with arsenic in alluvial aquifers of Chianan Plain southwestern Taiwan,Reza A;Jean J;Lee M;Kulp T;Hsu H;Liu C;Lee Y,"One borehole was installed in the Blackfoot Disease (BFD) area to collect organic-carbon and metal-rich sediments from various depths. Carbon- and metal-rich groundwaters were also collected to quantify arsenic and humic substances from different parts of the BFD area in Chianan Plain. UV-visible spectroscopy was performed to detect the presence of iron in humic substances. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectra showed that the functional groups such as COO-, C=O, OH, and C=C (aromatic ring) were present in humic substances of southwestern Taiwan, and they act as chelating agents to bind with trace elements in sediments. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy also suggests that signals peaking at 30, 58, 68, 101.22, 168.23 and 210 ppm were assigned to the presence of aliphatic carbon, N-alkayl C, O-alkayl C, anomeric carbon, carboxyl carbon, and ketonic carbon of functional groups, respectively. The binding nature of arsenic with humic substances was also characterized using FTIR microscopy. FTIR spectra of laboratory-synthesized As-Fe-humic substance (HS) complexes were compared to those of Fe-HS complex and humic substances in order to demonstrate the presence of binary Fe-HS and ternary As-Fe-HS complexes in the aquifer. Organometallic complex (humic substances in combination with arsenic) in groundwater of southwestern Taiwan may cause BFD. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

2013.0,J. Geochem. Explor.,The geochemical characteristics of the mud liquids in the Wushanting and Hsiaokunshui Mud Volcano region in southern Taiwan Implications of humic substances for binding and mobilization of arsenic,Liu C;Maity J;Jean J;Li Z;Kar S;Sracek O;Yang H;Chen C;Reza A;Bundschuh J;Lee C,"In this study, the geochemical characteristics of mud volcanoes were investigated to seek their possible linkage with arsenic mobilization in the region. Among the mud volcanoes of southern Taiwan, the largest and well-preserved active mud volcanoes are situated in Wushanting (WST) and Hsiaokunshui (HKS). These two selected active mud volcanoes are exhaling mainly methane (CH4>95%) along with other gases like O-2, CO2, CO, SO2, H2S, NO, and N-2. The content of CH4 in the HKS active mud volcano is very close to that of the WST mud volcano. High Na+ and Cl- concentrations in mud liquids and mudstone deposits indicate their origin in a marine depositional source. However, a newly erupted active mud volcano in WST reflects the presence of a high level of SO42-. Significant variations (p <= 0.05) in trace and transition element (V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Rb, Sr, Mo, Cd and Ba) concentrations in the liquids and sediments of mud volcanoes are noticed at different eruption-periods, suggesting different elemental compositions and release mechanisms in different locations. The weathering of micas as well as clay minerals seems to be responsible for the enrichment in trace metals in mud volcano sediments and fluids. Several trace elements (V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Zn) are strongly bound to the sediments, but concentrations of Cu, Se, and Sr are significantly higher in the fluids. The presence of higher As contents in the sediment of HKS was observed in contrast to its fluid. As a reducing agent, humic substances seem to play an important role in binding with trace elements and particularly As in the sediments. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectra of humic substances from muds showed the presence of possible functional groups of primary and secondary amines, ureas, urethanes (amide) and silica.

2019.0,J. Geochem. Explor.,Linkage of sulfur isotopic enrichment to sulfur and arsenic release in the coastal aquifers of southwestern Taiwan,Liu C;Jean J;Wang P;Rathod J;Wang C;Chen W,"High arsenic concentration in groundwater is influenced by redox reactions in As-bearing iron (oxy)hydroxide minerals and elevated total organic carbon, resulting in arsenic contamination and enrichment in groundwater after introduction of seawater into an aquifer. In this study, hydrochemical and isotopic (S, O and C) techniques were used to relate arsenic contamination and seawater flooding/intrusion in groundwater aquifers in the Chianan Plain, southwestern Taiwan. Thirty-three samples (30 from groundwater and 3 from river water) were collected from April-June of 2014. Most of the groundwater samples collected from the Chianan Plain were dominated by As(III), indicating that reducing conditions prevailed within the aquifers. The delta O-18-delta D plots of most of the groundwater samples from the Chianan Plain are generally lined on the global meteoric water line (GMWL), but the delta O-18 and delta D isotopic compositions of the river water samples show enriched signals. Salinity and sulfate concentrations of river water and shallow groundwater have been found to increase after seawater flooding/intrusion. The delta O-18 and dD isotopic compositions of the river water showed a gradual trend toward those of seawater. The trend in the isotopic compositions of the river and groundwater samples indicated a mixing of seawater and meteoric water. Up to the present, the groundwater levels in the coastal areas of the Chianan Plain have dropped to zero meters in elevation parallel to sea level due to excessive groundwater withdrawal, resulting in seawater intrusion into the aquifers in Budai, Yichu, and Beimen in the Plain. Moreover, high salinity (48.1 parts per thousand) occurred only in the Beimen 2B shallow groundwater at a depth of 60 m is a result of seawater flooding infiltration from the nearby salinized Pachang River. The delta S-34[SO4]/delta O-18[SO4] isotopic ratios (2.63-2.82) of low-As (concentration < 50 mu g/L) river water samples were similar to those of marine sulfate minerals dissolved in seawater, but were variable (0 - 2.93) among the high-As (concentration >= 50 mu g/L) groundwater samples from the Chianan Plain. Sulfates in seawater were introduced into the coastal aquifers of the Chianan Plain under the Holocene marine transgression, wherein the mixing of paleo- and modern-sulfates due to seawater intrusion might have occurred or are occurring. The release of sulfur and arsenic (mostly arsenite) in the Chianan Plain groundwater under reducing environments indicating redox reactions in sulfates and iron (oxy)hydroxide minerals may change the isotopic (S and O in sulfate) compositions in groundwater, resulting in enrichment of delta S-34[SO4] and delta O-18[SO4]. Salinity can promote arsenic release in groundwater and thus enrich the delta S-34[SO4] and delta O-18[SO4] isotopic compositions, in which 6.0-22.8 parts per thousand delta S-34[SO4] and 9.3-15.5 parts per thousand delta O-18[SO4]occur in shallow fresh groundwater (depth < 60 m) but up to 27.7 parts per thousand delta S-34[SO4] and 20.4 parts per thousand delta O-18[SO4] occur in shallow saline groundwater, in comparison to 0 parts per thousand delta S-34[SO4] and 5.4-6.5 parts per thousand delta O-18[SO4] in deep fresh groundwater (depth between 60 and 318 m) and up to 38. 5 parts per thousand delta S-34[SO4] and 18.7 parts per thousand delta O-18[SO4] in deep brackish groundwater. This study provides insights suggesting that the As-containing iron(II) minerals are oxidized to iron(III) minerals and then re-reduced to iron(II) which leads to As release.","Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, Taipei 106, Taiwan.;  Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei 11529, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei 106, Taiwan.;  Natl Cent Univ, Grad Inst Appl Geol, Taoyuan 32001, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,6,1.0,,"Jean, JS (corresponding author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and Technology, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan; Ministry of Education, TaiwanMinistry of Education, Taiwan","This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan; Ministry of Education, Taiwan.

2017.0,J. Geod. Geodyn.,Investigations of anomalous gravity signals prior to 71 large earthquakes based on a 4years long superconducting gravimeter records,Wang D;Hwang C;Shen W,"Using continuous 1-Hz sampling time-series recorded by a SG (superconducting gravimeter) at Hsinchu station, Taiwan of China, we investigate the anomalous gravity signals prior to 71 large earthquakes with moment magnitude larger than 7.0 (Mw7.0) occurred between 1 Jan 2008 and 31 Dec 2011. We firstly evaluate the noise level of the SG records at Hsinchu (HS) station in microseismic bands from 0.05 Hz to 0.1 Hz by computing the PSD (power spectral density) of seismically quiet days selected based on the RMS of records. Based on the analysis of the noise level and the spectral features of the seismically quiet SG records at HS station, we detect AGSs (anomalous gravity signals) prior to large earthquakes. We apply HHT (Hilbert-Huang transformation) to establish the TFEP (time-frequency-energy paradigms) and MS (marginal spectra) of the SG data before the large earthquakes, and the characteristics of TFEP and MS of the SGs data during the typhoon event are also analyzed. By comparing the spectral characteristics of the SGs data during seismically quiet period, three types of AGSs are found; and the occurrence rate of AGSs before 71 earthquakes is given in terms of the cases with different epicenter distance and different focal depth. The statistical results show that 56.3% of all the examined large earthquakes were preceded by AGSs; and if we constrain the epicenter distance to be smaller than 3500 km and focal depth less than 300 km, 75.3% of the examined large earthquakes can be associated with the AGSs. Especially, we note that for all the large earthquakes occurred in the Eurasian plate in recent four years, the precursory AGSs can always be found in the SG data recorded at HS station. Our investigations suggest that the AGSs prior to large earthquakes may be related to focal depth, epicentre distance and location.

1984.0,J. Geod. Soc. Jpn.,Crustal Movement of Eastern Taiwan and its Tectonic Significances,Sheu H;Sato H,"Taiwan is located along the north-west margin of the Philippine Sea plate and has a complicate tectonics. To clarify the tectonics in this region, secular horizontal strain in eastern Taiwan was obtained from the data of recent retriangulation. The strain along the Longitudinal Valley, a probable collision boundary between the Philippine Sea and the Eurasian plates, has a large strain rate of 2 to 3 micro-strain/yr and the axis of maximum compression intersects the valley with an angle of 60°, suggesting that the boundary has a component of left lateral movement. On the other hand, the strain pattern of northeastern Taiwan shows a marked contrast to that along the valley. The predominant strain is extensional one there, and its axis has a direction of nearly E-W, This suggests a right lateral movement on the plate boundary extending from the northeast coast of Taiwan to the southern end of the Ryukyu Trough. © 1984, The Geodetic Society of Japan.

Geodesy,Analysis of some systematic errors affecting altimeterderived sea surface gradient with application to geoid determination over Taiwan,Hwang C,"This paper analyzes several systematic errors affecting sea surface gradients derived from Seasat, Geosat/ERM, Geosat/GM, ERS-1/35d, ERS-1/GM and TOPEX/POSEIDON altimetry. Considering the data noises, the conclusion is: (1) only Seasat needs to correct for the non-geocentricity induced error, (2) only Seasat and Geosat/GM need to correct for the one cycle per revolution error, (3) only Seasat, ERS-1/GM and Geosat/GM need to correct for the tide model error; over shallow waters it is suggested to use a local tide model not solely from altimetry. The effects of the sea surface topography on gravity and geoid computations from altimetry are significant over areas with major oceanographic phenomena. In conclusion, sea surface gradient is a better data type than sea surface height. Sea surface gradients from altimetry, land gravity anomalies, ship gravity anomalies and elevation data were then used to calculate the geoid over Taiwan by least-squares collocation. The inclusion of sea surface gradients improves the geoid prediction by 27% when comparing the GPS-derived and the predicted geoidal heights, and by 30% when comparing the observed and the geoid-derived deflections of the vertical. The predicted geoid along coastal areas is accurate to 2 cm and can help GPS to do the third-order leveling.",,,,TAIWAN,1,,,"Hwang, C (corresponding author), NATL CHIAO TUNG UNIV,DEPT CIVIL ENGN,1001 TA HSUEH RD,HSINCHU 30050,TAIWAN.",,,,10.1007/s001900050080,Article,SATELLITE ALTIMETRY; GRAVITY-FIELD; TOPEX/POSEIDON; GEOSAT; OCEAN; COMPUTATION; ANOMALIES; ACCURACY,SPRINGER VERLAG,JOURNAL OF GEODESY,28,71,ISI,,NATL CHIAO TUNG UNIV,A
1999.0,J. Geodesy,An alternative expression for the variance factors in using Iterated Almost Unbiased Estimation,Hsu R,"An alternative expression has been derived for the variance factors when estimating weights according to the Iterated Almost Unbiased Estimation (IAUE) technique. A variance factor can be approximately estimated by finding the ratio of the group redundancy numbers at any two successive iterations. The numerical example of the first-order leveling network of Taiwan indicates: that stabilization of the redundancy number of an observation occurs as the variance factor associated with it converges to unity; that variance factors tend to approach unity for individual groups with large redundancy; and that for those variance factors which fail to converge to unity, the redundancy numbers decrease monotonically as the iteration proceeds.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Taipei 106, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,1,1.0,,"Hsu, R (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Taipei 106, Taiwan.",,,MINQUE; IAUE; redundancy number,10.1007/s001900050234,Article,,SPRINGER VERLAG,JOURNAL OF GEODESY,9,73,ISI,NATL TAIWAN UNIV,NATL TAIWAN UNIV,A

Geodesy,Gravity recovery using COSMIC GPS data application of orbital perturbation theory,Hwang C,"COSMIC is a joint Taiwan-US mission to study the atmosphere using the Global Positioning System (GPS) occultation technique. Improved formulas are developed for the radial, along-track, and cross-track perturbations, which are more accurate than the commonly used order-zero formulas. The formulas are used to simulate gravity recovery using the geodetic GPS data of COSMIC in the operational phase. Results show that the EGM96 model can be improved up to degree 26 using 1 year of COSMIC data. TOPEX/POSEIDON altimeter data are used to derive a temporal gravity variation. COSMIC cannot reproduce this gravity variation perfectly because of data noise and orbital configuration, but the recovered field clearly shows the gravity signature due to mass movement in an El Nine.","Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan.; Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.;",TAIWAN;USA,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,1,1.0,,"Hwang, C (corresponding author), Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Civil Engn, 1001 Ta Hsueh Rd, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan.",,,COSMIC; GPS; orbit perturbation; temporal gravity variation; El Nino,10.1007/s001900100159,Article,FIELD; TOPEX/POSEIDON,SPRINGER-VERLAG,JOURNAL OF GEODESY,17,75,ISI,NATL CHIAO TUNG UNIV;OHIO STATE UNIV,NATL CHIAO TUNG UNIV,A
2003.0,J. Geodesy,Orthometric corrections from leveling gravity density and elevation data a case study in Taiwan,Hwang C;Hsiao Y,"A new orthometric correction (OC) formula is presented and tested with various mean gravity reduction methods using leveling, gravity, elevation, and density data. For mean gravity computations, the Helmert method, a modified Helmert method with variable density and gravity anomaly gradient, and a modified Mader method were used. An improved method of terrain correction computation based on Gaussian quadrature is used in the modified Mader method. These methods produce different results and yield OCs that are greater than 10 cm between adjacent benchmarks (separated by similar to2 km) at elevations over 3000 in. Applying OC reduces misclosures at closed leveling circuits and improves the results of leveling network adjustments. Variable density yields variation of OC at millimeter level everywhere, while gravity anomaly gradient introduces variation of OC of greater than 10 cm at higher elevations, suggesting that these quantities must be considered in OC. The modified Mader method is recommended for computing OC.","Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,,"Hwang, C (corresponding author), Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Civil Engn, 1001 Ta Hsueh Rd, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan.",,,gravity anomaly gradient; geoid; orthometric correction; mean gravity; terrain correction,10.1007/s00190-003-0325-6,Article,GRADIENT,SPRINGER,JOURNAL OF GEODESY,25,77,ISI,NATL CHIAO TUNG UNIV,NATL CHIAO TUNG UNIV,A
2004.0,J. Geodesy,Decomposition of deformation primitives of horizontal geodetic networks application to Taiwans GPS network,Hsu R;Li S,"The contribution to each component of the deformation vector due to a marginally undetected blunder in an observation is split into two parts, and so are the deformation measures at a point. The first part, called the local component (or self component), signifies the contribution due to the redundancy-related multiplier belonging to the observation itself, while the second part, called the complementary component, shows the contribution due to the non-redundancy-related multipliers belonging to the observation. A larger redundancy results in a smaller local component for each component of the deformation vector. However, robustness due to an observation at a point is correlated with redundancy to a significant extent. The first-order global positioning system (GPS)-geodetic network of Taiwan was examined for its robustness. The experiments seem to indicate that: (1) large deformations tend to be found at points where the group redundancies are small; (2) the local components monopolize deformation measures at the perimeter stations of the network where very small redundancy numbers are found, (3) the largest deformation at a point may, be due to an observation not directly tied to the point of interest; and (4) except for local twisting. deformation measures and mean positional precisions at individual points Lire highly correlated.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Taipei 106, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,,"Hsu, R (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Taipei 106, Taiwan.",,,geodetic network; deformation; reliability; robustness; redundancy,10.1007/s00190-004-0399-9,Article,GEOMETRICAL STRENGTH; RELIABILITY,SPRINGER,JOURNAL OF GEODESY,9,78,ISI,NATL TAIWAN UNIV,NATL TAIWAN UNIV,A

An improved threshold retracker is developed. The performances of the Beta-5, threshold and improved threshold retrackers are assessed over waters around Taiwan. The improved threshold retracker outperforms the other two. The improvement in the accuracy of sea surface height (SSH) is investigated according to marine zone and the distance of waters to the shore. The improvement rate increases closer to the land, with the largest improvement rate of about 20% in waters within 10 km of the shore. Over waters around islands and coasts, there are still retracked SSHs with large errors. Least-squares collocation is used to compute gravity anomalies from the Geosat/GM altimeter data. Use of retracked SSHs improves the accuracy of gravity anomalies by about 11%. Adding airborne gravity data further improves the accuracy, especially in the immediate vicinity of the coasts. Tide model errors over coastal waters remain a problem in altimetry applications, even if the waveforms are properly retracked.","Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Hsinchu, Taiwan.; Xuzhou Normal Univ, Dept Surveying & Land Informat, Xuzhou 221116, Peoples R China.; Univ Newcastle, Sch Engn, Discipline Civil Surveying & Environm Engn, Newcastle, NSW 2308, Australia.;",TAIWAN;CHINA;AUSTRALIA,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,5,1.0,,"Hwang, CW (corresponding author), Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Civil Engn, 1001 Ta Hsueh Rd, Hsinchu, Taiwan.",,,Geosat/GM; gravity anomaly; waveform retracking; Taiwan; tide model error,10.1007/s00190-006-0052-x,Article,SEA-SURFACE; TAIWAN; FIELD,SPRINGER,JOURNAL OF GEODESY,98,80,ISI,NATL CHIAO TUNG UNIV;XUZHOU NORMAL UNIV;UNIV NEWCASTLE,NATL CHIAO TUNG UNIV,A

Geodesy,Precise orbit determination for the FORMOSAT3COSMIC satellite mission using GPS,Hwang C;Tseng T;Lin T;Svehla D;Schreiner B,"The joint Taiwan-US mission FORMOSAT-3/ COSMIC (COSMIC) was launched on April 17, 2006. Each of the six satellites is equipped with two POD antennas. The orbits of the six satellites are determined from GPS data using zero-difference carrier-phase measurements by the reduced dynamic and kinematic methods. The effects of satellite center of mass (COM) variation, satellite attitude, GPS antenna phase center variation (PCV), and cable delay difference on the COSMIC orbit determination are studied. Nominal attitudes estimated from satellite state vectors deliver a better orbit accuracy when compared to observed attitude. Numerical tests show that the COSMIC COM must be precisely calibrated in order not to corrupt orbit determination. Based on the analyses of the 5 and 6-h orbit overlaps of two 30-h arcs, orbit accuracies from the reduced dynamic and kinematic solutions are nearly identical and are at the 2-3 cm level. The mean RMS difference between the orbits from this paper and those from UCAR (near real-time) and WHU (post-processed) is about 10 cm, which is largely due to different uses of GPS ephemerides, high-rate GPS clocks and force models. The kinematic orbits of COSMIC are expected to be used for recovery of temporal variations in the gravity field.","Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan.;  Tech Univ Munich, Inst Astron & Phys Geodesy, D-80333 Munich, Germany.;  UCAR, Boulder, CO USA.;",TAIWAN;GERMANY;USA,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,5,1.0,,"Hwang, C (corresponding author), Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Civil Engn, 1001 Ta Hsueh Rd, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan.","National Science Council of TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [NSC 95-2221-E-009-353]; National Space Organization [95-NSPO-RS3-FA09-01-B]","This research is supported by the National Science Council of Taiwan (grant No.: NSC 95-2221-E-009-353) and the National Space Organization (grant No.: 95-NSPO-RS3-FA09-01-B).

2017.0,J. Geodesy,A clear link connecting the troposphere and ionosphere ionospheric reponses to the 2015 Typhoon Dujuan,Kong J;Yao Y;Xu Y;Kuo C;Zhang L;Liu L;Zhai C,"The global navigation satellite system (GNSS) total electron content (TEC) sequences were used to capture the arrival time and location of the ionosphere disturbances in response to the 2015 Typhoon Dujuan. After removing the de-trended TEC variation, the clear ionosphere disturbances on the typhoon landing day could be distinguished, and these disturbances disappeared from the TEC sequences before and after the typhoon landing day. The foF2 data observed by Xiamen ionosonde station also show ionosphere disturbances. Based on the advantages of GNSS multi-point observations, the disturbances horizontal velocity in the ionosphere were estimated according to the linear theory for a dispersion relation of acoustic gravity waves (AGWs) in an isothermal atmosphere. The average horizontal velocity (240 m/s) and the radial velocity (287 m/s) were used in the two-dimensional grid search for the origin point on the Earth's surface. The origin area was determined to be on the eastern side of Taiwan. Lastly, a possible physical mechanism is discussed in this study. When typhoons land on Taiwan, the severe convective storms and the drag effect from the Central Mountains create an ideal location for development of AGWs. Topographic conditions, like the high lapse rate, contribute to the formation of AGWs, which then propagates into the ionosphere altitude.","Wuhan Univ, Chinese Antarctic Ctr Surveying & Mapping, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.;  Wuhan Univ, Sch Geodesy & Geomat, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.;  Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Geomat, Tainan, Taiwan.;",CHINA;CHINA;TAIWAN,CHINA,CHINA,7,3.0,,"Yao, YB (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Sch Geodesy & Geomat, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.","National Natural Fund of China [41274022, 41231064, 41574028]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2042016kf0037]","We acknowledge the CMONOC for providing the GPS data via the GNSS Center at Wuhan University, the National Land Surveying and Mapping Center for providing the Taiwan GNSS Network data, the IGS for providing the orbit data.

2019.0,J. Geodesy,The ongoing modernization of the Taiwan semidynamic datum based on the surface horizontal deformation model using GNSS data from 2000 to 2016,Li C;Ching K;Chen K,"A semi-dynamic geodetic datum, composed of a static geodetic datum and a surface deformation model, is proposed in this study to maintain the accuracy of geodetic datum in Taiwan. A concept to construct the surface deformation model is also suggested to accommodate the characteristics of temporal variation of the velocity field and coseismic displacements caused by earthquakes in Taiwan. In this study, we proposed a surface deformation model, containing a secular velocity grid model during 2000-2016 and a coseismic displacement grid model of the 2016 M-L 6.6 Meinong earthquake, as an example to examine its adaptability in Taiwan. The secular velocity field relative to the station KMNM from 2000 to 2016 was first evaluated in this study using data from 380 continuous GNSS stations in Taiwan. Integrating 672 campaign-mode GNSS velocities from 2002 to 2016, a secular velocity grid model was constructed using the Kriging interpolation method. The high-precision coseismic displacements of the 2016 Meinong earthquake calculated using the IGS ultra-rapid orbit were also evidenced. The coseismic displacement grid model for all Taiwan for this event was built using the kinematic dislocation model to prevent contamination from nontectonic sources. Another 1341 independent GNSS control points surveyed in 2013 and 2016 were adopted to validate the reliability of the surface deformationmodel. After correction by the deformationmodel, 1219 points (91%) matched the criterion at the urban region of cadastral surveying in Taiwan (< 6 cm). The Electronic Global Navigation Satellite System (e-GNSS) in Taiwan is suggested to be integrated with the geodetic semi-dynamic datum to improve the precision of e-GNSS and to monitor the accuracy of the surface deformation model in the Taiwan semi-dynamic datum.","Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Geomat, Tainan, Taiwan.;  Kaohsiung City Govt, Land Adm Bur, Cishan Land Off, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.;  Natl Taipei Univ, Dept Real Estate & Built Environm, New Taipei, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,1.0,"Ching, KE (corresponding author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Geomat, Tainan, Taiwan.",[NLSC-106-22]; [NLSC-107-40]; [CGS106-5226904000-07-01]; [CGS 107-5226904000-07-01],"We thank CGS of Taiwan for the campaign-surveyed GNSS velocity field and the MOI, CWB, NLSC, AS, NCKU and the International GNSS Service for continuous GNSS observations.

Some 6000 new land gravity values at a 0.03-mGal precision make a notable contribution to the geoid modeling. Shipborne gravity data in waters 20 km offshore Taiwan were collected to improve the coastal geoid precision. In a circular area of 50 km around each of the five major tide gauges in Taiwan, gravity data were measured to improve vertical datum connections between Taiwan and its four offshore islands. Height anomalies were computed first and then converted to geoid heights. At > 2000 benchmarks, we obtained measured geoid heights to assess the gravimetric-only geoid and to create a hybrid geoid. Our assessments and formal errors from least-squares collocation indicate few cm of standard deviations for both geoid models, but the gravimetric geoid has mean differences of up to 20 cm with the measured geoidal heights. The hybrid geoid is used in RTK-VBS orthometric heighting, achieving a 5-cm precision. The gravimetric geoid is used to determine the relative differences in the ocean's mean dynamic topography (MDT) between Taiwan and the four offshore islands, which are also compared with those from oceanic and altimetric methods for estimating MDT. Differences in MDT help to identify 41.7 cm and 54.1 cm offsets in the current vertical datums of Penghu and Lanyu islands. In a low-lying, flood-prone region of southern Taiwan, the hybrid geoid improves LiDAR mapping of sub-zero elevation zones by 20 cm, corresponding to 70 years of sea level rise at an assumed rate of 0.286 cm/yr.","Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Civil Engn, 1001 Ta Hsueh Rd, Hsinchu, Taiwan.;  Curtin Univ Technol, Sch Earth & Planetary Sci, GPOB U1987, Perth, WA 6845, Australia.;  Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Geomat, 1 Univ Rd, Tainan, Taiwan.;  Minist Interior, Dept Land Adm, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Natl Taipei Univ, Dept Real Estate & Built Environm, 151 Univ Rd, New Taipei, Taiwan.;  Minist Interior, Natl Land Surveying & Mapping Ctr, Taichung, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;AUSTRALIA;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,12,1.0,,"Hwang, C (corresponding author), Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Civil Engn, 1001 Ta Hsueh Rd, Hsinchu, Taiwan.","MOST, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [106-2221-E-009-133-MY3, 107-2611-M-009-001]; Department of Land Administration, Ministry of the Interior, Taiwan","This study is funded by MOST, Taiwan, under grants 106-2221-E-009-133-MY3 and 107-2611-M-009-001, and Department of Land Administration, Ministry of the Interior, Taiwan, under the project ""Gravity Datum Service"" (2004 to present).

Geodesy,New interpretation of the rupture process of the 2016 Taiwan Meinong Mw 64 earthquake based on the InSAR 1Hz GPS and strong motion data,Yang Y;Chen Q;Diao X;Zhao J;Xu L;Hu J,"A new interpretation of the 2016 Meinong earthquake is proposed based on the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites, high-rate GPS and strong motion data. The fault geometry is firstly estimated by the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) surface deformation data. Then, the coseismic rupture process is inferred through the 1-Hz GPS and strong motion data based on the estimated fault geometry parameters. The InSAR-derived best-fitting fault geometry model suggests that the preferred fault strike and dip angles are 271.7 degrees and 22.7 degrees, respectively. The inferred fault rupture model indicates that the coseismic fault rupture is a mixed motion of thrust and left-strike slip with the maximum slip of similar to 1.0 m, and the high slip area is located at 9-16 km underground. The snapshots demonstrate that the coseismic fault rupture propagation is along the northwest direction, with the entire duration of similar to 16 s. Besides, the InSAR-derived faulting model reflects that the InSAR observation includes the deformation caused by aseismic slip and aftershock. However, the InSAR-derived fault geometry model can significantly contribute to the estimation of the rupture process based on the high-rate GPS and strong motion data.","Chengdu Univ Technol, State Key Lab Geohazard Prevent & Geoenvironm Pro, Chengdu 610059, Sichuan, Peoples R China.;  Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Dept Remote Sensing & Geoinformat Engn, Chengdu 611756, Sichuan, Peoples R China.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.;",CHINA;CHINA;TAIWAN,CHINA,CHINA,6,3.0,2.0,"Yang, YH (corresponding author), Chengdu Univ Technol, State Key Lab Geohazard Prevent & Geoenvironm Pro, Chengdu 610059, Sichuan, Peoples R China.","Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) under the ALOS-2 RA6 Project [3255, 3105]; Fund for Creative Research Groups of ChinaScience Fund for Creative Research Groups [41521002]; Applied Basic Research Program of Science and Technology Department of Sichuan Province [2020YJ0116]; Open Funding Project of State Key Laboratory of Geohazard Prevention and Geohazard Protection [SKLGP2020K019]; National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFC1505402, 2018YFC1504901]","Appreciation is owed to Hsiu-Fang Lee and Xia Zhong, who helped us to prepare some figures.

2021.0,J. Geodesy,Timing of coseismic displacement grid model construction for updating the semikinematic reference frame case study in Taiwan,Hsiao S;Ching K;Chen K;Li C,"Construction of a coseismic displacement grid model (hereafter referred to as the grid model) is a critical strategy for maintaining the precision of the semi-kinematic reference frame. However, no unequivocal criteria have yet been suggested for the timing of grid model construction. To clarify this timing, the observations of continuous global navigation satellite system in Taiwan were evaluated using coordinate time series analysis from 2003 to 2018 and a horizontal precision of approximately 14 mm was proposed as the threshold to construct a grid model. Next, two strategies were proposed to evaluate the timing on the basis of earthquake information. For Strategy I, the possible maximum surface displacement was derived using the forward dislocation model based on the hypocenter, moment magnitude and focal mechanism solution provided by the Real-Time Moment Tensor Monitoring System. For Strategy II, a required minimum magnitude (RMM) checking grid was constructed using the hypocenter and local magnitude data from the Central Weather Bureau, Taiwan. If the forwarded maximum surface displacement from Strategy I is larger than the threshold of 14 mm or the local magnitude of an earthquake is larger than the RMM from Strategy II, it represents the timing for the grid model construction. On the basis of the validation results for 20 selected earthquakes, both two strategies were proposed to be implemented simultaneously for timing evaluation to avoid overlooking detectable events.","Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Tainan, Taiwan.;  Natl Taipei Univ, New Taipei, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,4,1.0,1.0,"Ching, KE (corresponding author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Tainan, Taiwan.",[NLSC-105-38]; [NLSC-106-22]; [NLSC-107-40]; [NLSC-108-42]; [107-2221-E-305-008-MY3],"We thank the Central Weather Bureau, Ministry of Interior, National Land Surveying and Mapping Center, Central Geological Survey, and Institute of Earth Science, Academia Sinica for continuous GNSS data.

1988.0,J. Geodyn.,Crustal movement along a collision boundary of plates case of eastern Taiwan,Kosuga M;Sato H;Tanaka T;Sheu H,"Recent crustal movements in eastern Taiwan were investigated based on geodetic and seismological data as a case study of the tectonics along a colliding plate boundary. Secular horizontal strain along the Longitudinal Valley, a probable arc-continent collision boundary between the Philippine Sea and Eurasion plates, is compressive with a large rate of 2 microstrains/year, and the maximum compression axis trends in NW-SE direction. This means that nearly two-thirds of the convergence rate between the two plates is consumed in the narrow zone along the valley and confirms the view that the valley is the plate boundary between the two. The amount of uplift in the Central Range, deduced from trigonometric leveling, reaches more than one meter during the past 60 years. Such active orogeny is caused by the high strain rate in this area. Horizontal displacement of the Coastal Range, a leading edge of the Philippine Sea plate, has a left-lateral component, suggesting that the boundary is a region of oblique collision and the range moves toward the north, producing subduction of the Philippine Sea plate off the Coast of northeastern Taiwan. An extensional strain pattern is found northeastern Taiwan near Hualien, in northern Taiwan near Ilan, and in southeastern Taiwan south Taitung. In northeastern Taiwan, the direction of the maximum extension axis is nearly parallel to the isodipth contours of deep-focus earthquakes that occurred under the southern part of the Ryukyu Trench. From a model calculation using a finite-element method, this pattern of strain is interpreted as an edge effect of the collision-subduction junction in northeastern Taiwan. The direction of the maximum extension in northern Taiwan forms high angles with the direction of the tectonic line near Ilan stretching from the Okinawa Trough. This fact is harmonious with the view that the Okinawa Trough is spreading. Extensional strain observed in southeastern Taiwan may be related to the eastward subduction since the area is situated on a transition zone, from collision to subduction. © 1988.","Faculty of Science, Hirosaki University, Japan; Disaster Prevention Research Institute, Kyoto University, Japan; Ta-Han Junior College of Engineering and Business, Taiwan",JAPAN;JAPAN;TAIWAN,JAPAN,JAPAN,4,3.0,0.0,"Kosuga, M.; Faculty of Science, Hirosaki UniversityJapan",,NA NA,,10.1016/0264-3707(88)90025-7,Article,collision boundary;  convergence rate;  crustal movement;  extensional strain pattern;  geodetic data;  orogeny;  plate boundary;  plate margin;  seismological data;  subduction;  uplift; Taiwan,,Journal of Geodynamics,2,10,scopus,HIROSAKI UNIVERSITY;KYOTO UNIVERSITY;TA-HAN JUNIOR COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING AND BUSINESS,HIROSAKI UNIVERSITYJAPAN,B2
2000.0,J. Geodyn.,Active faulting and earthquake hazard The case study of the Chihshang Fault Taiwan,Angelier J;Chu H;Lee J;Hu J,"The Longitudinal Valley Fault Zone of eastern Taiwan is the present-day plate boundary between the Philippine Sea Plate and the South China block of Eurasia, Repeated surveys of active deformation were carried out at five sites along its most active segment, the Chihshang Fault. Annual surveys during the period 1990-1997 reveal a rather constant slip velocity of 2.2 cm/yr in a N40 degrees W direction, involving both a thrust component with horizontal shortening of nearly 1.7 cm/yr and a left-lateral component of nearly 1.3 cm/yr. The fault trends N18 degrees E and dips 39-45 degrees to the east. The vertical displacement velocity is about 1.3 cm/yr and the actual oblique offset of the fault increases at a rate of 2.6 cm/yr. Comparison with GPS data suggests that some additional deformation occurs on the edge of the Valley. Active faulting of the Chihshang Fault and of the entire Longitudinal,Valley Fault Zone accounts for 24% and 37% (respectively) of the total shortening across the Taiwan collision in the N54 degrees W direction of relative motion between the Philippine Sea Plate and the South China shelf. This distribution of relative displacements illustrates the major role played by this boundary, as a zone of mechanical weakness where tectonic partitioning occurs. Permanent surveying of the displacement on the Chihshang Fault has the potential to detect significant decrease in slip rates, and hence to predict forthcoming locking stages, which would increase earthquake hazard.

2006.0,J. Geodyn.,Tidal strain observations in ChuChie Taiwan,Takemoto S;Lee M;Chen C;Kao M;Mukai A;Ikawa T;Kuroda T;Abe T,"In Chu-Chie, Taiwan, tidal strain observation with a borehole strainmeter system has been carried out since 2001. The Chu-Chie station (N23 degrees 31'39"", E120 degrees 35'59"", h=300m) is located in the central part of Taiwan and is about 40 km distant from the epicenter of the destructive Chi-Chi earthquake (M-L = 7.3) which occurred on September 21, 1999. The strainmeter system detects three components of horizontal strains in 82 degrees, 202 degrees and 322 degrees measured from the North in clockwise directions using differential transformers. We analyzed tidal strains and determined amplitudes and phase lags of 13 major constituents by applying the tidal-analysis program BAYTAP-G to 1-year strain data of 2003. The ""observed"" tidal strain amplitudes were compared with the ""theoretically expected"" amplitudes that were obtained from the GOTIC2 program. As a result, the ratio of the observed amplitudes and the theoretically expected amplitudes ranges between 0.7 and 3.3. Some parts of these discrepancies may be caused by uncertainty of determination of scale factors of instruments. Other reasons to be considered are complicated geological and topographic effects around the observation site. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

2008.0,J. Geodyn.,The ChiChi 1999 earthquake Correlation between the spatiotemporal distribution of aftershocks and viscoelastic stress changes,Shieh C;Sheu S,"The Chi-Chi 1999 (ML = 7.3) earthquake generated a large number of aftershocks in the vicinity of the rupture plane. The spatial-temporal distribution of these aftershocks was recorded with high precision and thus provided a unique possibility to study whether the correlation between aftershocks and stress changes are primary due to coseismically induced stress changes (static), or whether stress relaxation processes (viscoelastic) in the lower crust contribute significantly to this correlation. From our analysis of a 3D finite element model simulating the viscoelastic stress changes due to the coseismic displacement and tectonic loading we found that the aftershocks are highly correlated with the stress variations (static and viscoelastic) caused by the main shock. Although we found that the correlation between seismicity rate changes and viscoelastic stress fluctuation is slightly better than that of the static stress changes, these differences can only be identified well in the lower crust. As a result, it is reasonable to conclude that static stress changes are the key mechanism for triggering early and shallow aftershocks in the upper crust. It is reasonable to infer that the viscoelastic relaxation in the lower crust does affect the occurrence of early aftershocks in the deep crust, but it does not significantly affect the shallow aftershocks. However, the stress changes induced from the lower crust gradually transfer to the upper crust and may influence the occurrence of aftershocks after a longer time period (>four Maxwell times).

Geodyn.,Expected temporal absolute gravity change across the Taiwanese Orogen a modeling approach,Mouyen M;Masson F;Hwang C;Cheng C;Cattin R;Lee C;Le M N;Hinderer J;Malavieille J;Bayer R;Luck B,"The island of Taiwan is located on the convergent boundary between the Philippine Sea plate and the Chinese continental margin. It offers very active mountain building and collapsing processes well illustrated by the rugged topography, rapid uplift and denudation, young tectonic landforms, active faulting and numerous earthquakes. In this paper, using simple models, we have estimated vertical movements and associated absolute gravity variations which can be expected along a profile crossing the southern part of the island and probably suffering the highest rates of rising. The two different tectonic styles proposed for the island, thin-skinned and thick-skinned, were taken into account. Horizontal and vertical movements were modeled by an elastic deformation code. Gravity variations due to these deformations are then modeled at a second step. They are dominated by plate and free-air effects, i.e. elevation of the topography, with several mu Gal yr(-1). By comparison, gravity changes generated by mass transfers are weak: maximum 0.1 mu Gal yr(-1) with the thin-skinned tectonic and 0.3 mu Gal yr(-1) with the thick-skinned tectonic. Though elastic rheology has limitations, this modeling offers interesting results on what gravity signal can be expected from the AGTO project (Absolute Gravity in the Taiwanese Orogen), which proposes to study the dynamic of these mountain ranges using absolute gravimetry (AG) and also including relative gravimetry (RG) and GPS measurements.

To address these questions, we present the results of a series of analogue experiments performed to characterize the processes and parameters responsible for accretion, exhumation and tectonosedimentary reworking of oceanic basement lithospheric fragments in an accretionary wedge.

2016.0,J. Geodyn.,Tomographic imaging of a seismic cluster in northern Taiwan and its implications for crustal fluid migration,Cheng W;Chang C,"After the occurrence of the 1999 magnitude 7.3 Chi-Chi earthquake, a cluster of NE-SW trending earthquakes, almost distributed along the surface trace of the Lishan fault, has been detected in northern Taiwan. From the spatiotemporal distribution of hypocenters based on cluster analysis, the Lishan Fault cluster (LFC) can quantify the influence of crustal fluids on the occurrence of seismicity after the 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake. In order to investigate the possible causes of the seismicity clusters and their relationship to the movement of fluids through part of the collision/subduction system, high-resolution 3-D tomographic images of the crust are determined under the entire region of northern Taiwan by inverting a large number of arrival time data of P-waves and S-waves. The results of seismic tomographic inversion indicate that the LFC extends down to about 10 km depth and seems to be distributed in or around the low Vp, high Vp/Vs zones. This temporal expansion of the focal area during the first week may be attributed to fluid diffusion. The b-value of the LFC is about 0.98 close to the average value, 1.0 of the entire Taiwan region. Our tomographic images demonstrate a series of relatively high Vp/Vs anomalies dipping to the east which seems to form a fluid upwelling conduit beneath the Central Range. We thus suggest that the Lishan Fault might-play a role of an active fluid conduit, transferring additional fluids of the Philippines Sea plate along the east-dipping fault zone into the upper crust.

Geogr.,GIS Adoption Among Senior High School Geography Teachers in Taiwan,Lay J;Chen Y;Chi Y,"This article explores the adoption of geographic information system (GIS) knowledge and skills through in-service training for high school geography teachers in Taiwan. Through statistical analysis of primary data collected from a census of Taiwan's high school geography teachers, it explores what motivates these teachers to undertake GIS training. The design of the questionnaire was largely inspired by the technology acceptance model (TAM) and the social influence model (SIM). The former model postulates the influence of perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU) of GIS on teachers' actual adoption of the technology. The latter, in contrast, postulates that teachers' usage of GIS is affected by their peers and their schools.

2013.0,J. Geogr.,GIS Education in Taiwanese Senior High Schools A National Survey Among Geography Teachers,Wang Y;Chen C,"Following the integration of GIS into the national curriculum standards of senior high school geography, Taiwan has systematically implemented GIS education for over a decade. However, the effectiveness of this implementation is currently unclear. Therefore, this study investigates the status of GIS education in Taiwanese senior high schools. A nationwide questionnaire survey and ten personal interviews were conducted between 2009 and 2010. The results indicate that approximately 99 percent of teachers are confident to teach about GIS. The current educational strategies of pro- moting GIS have proven effective and shall be continued and expanded. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Department of Geography, National Taiwan Normal University, Taipei City, Taiwan; National Taiwan Normal University, Taipei City, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,,"Wang, Y.-H.; Department of Geography, , Taipei City, Taiwan","National Science CouncilNational Science Council, NSC, 98-2410-H-00 3-074-SS3","This study is supported by the Taiwan National Science Council (NSC 98-2410-H-00 3-074-SS3).

2000.0,J. Geol.,Supply and removal of sediment in a landslidedominated mountain belt Central Range Taiwan,Hovius N;Stark C;Chu H;Lin J,"A strong coupling between hillslope and valley systems is often inferred for mountain landscapes dominated by bedrock landsliding. We reveal the nature of this link using data sets on landsliding and sediment transport from two montane catchments draining the eastern Central Range of Taiwan. Here, the magnitude-frequency distribution of landslides can be modeled by a robust power law, but this scale invariance is not mirrored in the sediment discharge at the mountain front. Instead, downstream sediment loads reflect a complex response to both sediment supply and ambient hydraulic conditions. The rivers do not transport significant amounts of sediment unless it is provided by hillslope mass wasting in the catchment. Removal of landslide debris is a function of the transport capacity of the stream at the site of entry; thus, there is a dual supply and transport control on sediment loads in bedrock-floored streams. Over a monitoring period of >25 yr, the bulk of the sediment leaving the mountain belt was supplied by climate-triggered mass wasting. Peaks in water discharge were always closely followed by sediment load maxima, and the rapid decay of the latter indicates an effective removal of most supply Where an important part of a catchment's sediment yield is derived from interfluves, sediment transport cannot simply be estimated from known water discharge time series, using a sediment rating curve, but requires instead a detailed knowledge of the spatial and temporal patterns of hillslope mass wasting and sediment transfer into the fluvial system.","Univ Cambridge, Dept Earth Sci, Cambridge CB2 3EQ, England.; Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA.; Minist Econ Affairs, Cent Geol Survey, Taipei, Taiwan.; Taiwan Natl Univ, Dept Geog, Taipei, Taiwan.;",UNITED KINGDOM;USA;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,UNITED KINGDOM,UNITED KINGDOM,4,3.0,2.0,"Hovius, N (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Earth Sci, Downing St, Cambridge CB2 3EQ, England.",,,,10.1086/314387,Article,EARTHQUAKE-INDUCED LANDSLIDES; ARC-CONTINENT COLLISION; GRAVEL-BED RIVERS; TECTONIC SIGNIFICANCE; BEDLOAD TRANSPORT; CHANNEL NETWORKS; DRAINAGE BASINS; DEBRIS FLOW; EVOLUTION; BEDROCK,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY,332,108,ISI,UNIV CAMBRIDGE;COLUMBIA UNIV;TAIWAN NATL UNIV,UNIV CAMBRIDGE,B2
2005.0,J. Geol.,Hyperpycnal discharge of fluvial sediment to the ocean Impact of SuperTyphoon Herb 1996 on Taiwanese rivers,Milliman J;Kao S,"Hyperpycnal events (when suspended sediment concentrations exceed 40 g/L) occur in small- and medium-sized rivers throughout the world but are particularly common in Taiwan; they are often related to landslides or debris flows initiated and transported by typhoon floods. Super-Typhoon Herb, which swept across Taiwan on July 31-August 2, 1996, triggered floods and landslides throughout the southern part of the island. Sediment concentrations in at least seven rivers (Taan, Choshui, Pachang, Erhjen, Tsengwen, Kaoping, and Peinan) approached or exceeded 40 g/L. Calculated sediment discharged from nine rivers (these seven as well as the Wu and Houlung, neither of which apparently reached hyperpycnal concentrations) during these 3 d was 217 million tons (MT)-most of it on August 1-of which similar to 80% was discharged at hyperpycnal concentrations. Presumably, most of the sediments discharged by the Peinan River (to the southeast) and the Kaoping, Erhjen, Tsengwen, and Pachang rivers (to the southwest) were transported directly to the Huatong Basin and the South China Sea (via the Penghu Canyon system), respectively. The bulk of the typhoon-derived sediment (142 MT), however, was discharged to the northwest (primarily by the Choshui River), and its fate remains unknown. It may have ultimately reached the Penghu Canyon system and thereby the South China Sea, but more probably it was transported northward (via the Taiwan Warm Current) toward China, the East China Sea, or (perhaps) the Okinawa Trough.","Coll William & Mary, Sch Marine Sci, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA.; Acad Sinica, Res Ctr Environm Change, Taipei 115, Taiwan.;",USA;TAIWAN,USA,USA,2,2.0,2.0,"Milliman, JD (corresponding author), Coll William & Mary, Sch Marine Sci, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA.",,,,10.1086/431906,Article,MOUNTAIN BELT; ISLAND; EROSION; MOUTHS; BASIN; RATES,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY,126,113,ISI,COLL WILLIAM AND MARY;ACAD SINICA,COLL WILLIAM AND MARY,B2
2005.0,J. Geol.,Transportdominated sediment loading in Taiwanese rivers A case study from the Maan Stream,Kao S;Chan S;Kuo C;Liu K,"We report newly obtained data of total suspended sediment concentrations ( C(s)) and water discharges from the Maan Stream in the eastern Taiwan, where intermittent supply-limited conditions with a minimal constant load were invoked for sediment discharge ( Hovius et al. 2000). The main evidence for the supply-limited condition is the many zero values of C(s) corresponding to low-flow conditions recorded in the hydrological archive of the Water Resources Agency ( WRA) of Taiwan. Such conditions form a distinct mode in the rating relationship between loading and discharge, which is discontinuous from the normal mode. However, our data raise serious doubt regarding the sensitivity of the measurements that produced data in support of the minimal constant load. A field sampling from April 4 to May 5, 2003, was conducted in the Ma-an Stream during a very dry period. Our observations showed no zero values, even though the sampling period was one of the driest periods in comparison with historical records. In our study, 11 of 35 daily samples gave C(s) values between 10 and 100 mg L(-1), whereas only one record from the entire 1980-1994 WRA data set fell in this range, indicating the poor sensitivity of the WRA measurements. Our observations contradict the fact that more than two-thirds of C(s) values are null in the WRA records for the rivers at the foothills of the Central Range in eastern Taiwan. The relationships between C(s) and discharge and between sediment loading and discharge all demonstrate that our data are consistent with the trend manifested by the nonzero values from the WRA records. Therefore, we conclude that the existing data do not support the proposed discontinuous dual-mode rating relationship for rivers at the foothills of the Central Range in eastern Taiwan.","Acad Sinica, Res Ctr Environm Change, Taipei 115, Taiwan.; Natl Cent Univ, Inst Hydrol Sci, Tao Yuan, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,4,1.0,,"Kao, SJ (corresponding author), POB 1-55, Taipei, Taiwan.",,,,10.1086/427670,Article,MOUNTAIN BELT; DISCHARGE; OCEAN; ISLANDS; EROSION; FLUXES,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY,15,113,ISI,ACAD SINICA;NATL CENT UNIV,SJ (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR),A
2006.0,J. Geol.,Moderate chemical weathering of subtropical Taiwan Constraints from solidphase geochemistry of sediments and sedimentary rocks,Selvaraj K;Chen C,"The well-known earthquake-and-storm-triggered extremely high physical weathering rate in Taiwan is consistent with present geochemical studies of sediments from different subenvironments (offshore, coastal, river, and lake) and sedimentary rocks of different geological ages, indicating a moderate chemical weathering condition. Major and trace element concentrations normalized to the average upper crust of Yangtze Craton show that the sediments and the average composition of sedimentary rocks of Taiwan are depleted in Ca, Mg, Na, and Sr, enriched in Rb and Zr, and unchanged with respect to K, indicating their moderately altered nature. The mean chemical index of alteration (CIA; 71-75) and plagioclase index of alteration (PIA; 81-86) values of coastal and offshore sediments reveal the sediments' derivation from sedimentary rocks by moderate silicate chemical weathering processes. The mean CIA value (62) of sedimentary rocks of Taiwan is similar to that for Chinese sediment (61), further confirming the above inference. A-CN-K, (A-K)-C-N, and A-CNK-FM plots (A = Al-2 O-3; C = CaO*; N = Na2O; K = K2O; F = FeOT; M = MgO) also confirm that the sediments and sedimentary rocks in Taiwan have undergone moderate silicate weathering, an interpretation consistent with CIA and PIA values. The plots also indicate the presence of illite, chlorite, and a subordinate amount of unaltered feldspars in sediments and sedimentary rocks, which are indicative of the physically weathered and/or moderately chemically altered nature of sediments. The dominance of illite, chlorite, and unaltered feldspars as inferred from geochemical data suggests that the immature nature of sediments and sedimentary rocks is probably a result of low residence times in the source region or river basin and quick removal of materials from the soil profile by steep, mountainous rivers (physical weathering dominates). Elemental ratios such as Rb/Sr, K/Rb, molar K/Na, and Al/Na are close to crustal values. Average shale and river particulates such as those from the Yellow River also indicate moderate chemical weathering conditions for sediments and sedimentary rocks, except for high alpine lake sediments, where the prevailing extreme chemical weathering condition over erosion is clearly differentiated by higher CIA (80-84) and PIA (92-96) values and by their positions on triangular plots. These inferences have also been illustratively corroborated by scatter plots of data such as Rb/Sr versus molar K/Na, and Al/Na versus CIA. Additional evidence from published sources noted here also favors moderate chemical weathering conditions for Taiwan. Geochemical variation of offshore, coastal, and river sediments is mainly controlled by non-steady state weathering dominated by erosion. Steady state weathering, however, seems to produce highly weathered sediments in the alpine region of Taiwan.","Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Inst Marine Geol & Chem, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,1.0,"Selvaraj, K (corresponding author), Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Inst Marine Geol & Chem, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.",,,,10.1086/498102,Article,CONTINENTAL-CRUST; EROSION RATES; SOUTH-AFRICA; RIVER; PETROGENESIS; PROVENANCE; HIMALAYAN; QUARTZ; IMPACT; EARTHS,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY,158,114,ISI,NATL SUN YAT SEN UNIV,NATL SUN YAT SEN UNIV,B2
2008.0,J. Geol.,Water and sediment discharge from small mountainous rivers Taiwan The roles of lithology episodic events and human activities,Kao S;Milliman J,"Taiwan's natural setting creates highly vulnerable watersheds whose rivers discharge disproportionately large quantities of sediment to the coastal ocean. The 16 Taiwanese rivers analyzed in this article discharge similar to 180 Mt yr(-1) of sediment to the coastal ocean, although totals over the past 20 years have varied between 16 and 440 Mt yr(-1). The mean annual sediment yield of 9500 t km(-2) yr(-1) for the 16 rivers is 60-fold greater than the global yield of 150 t km(-2) yr(-1), but mean yields for the individual rivers vary by more than 2 orders of magnitude, from 500 to 71; 000 t km(-2) yr(-1). Most sediment erosion and delivery occur in response to typhoon-generated floods, as evidenced by the fact that > 75% of the long-term flux occurs in < 1% of the time, about one-third of which reaches hyperpycnal concentrations. Detailed analysis of the 16 watersheds reveals little evidence of any single environmental factor that controls sediment load. The Erren, the highest-yield river on Taiwan, drains an erodible but low-gradient watershed with relatively low runoff. In contrast, three east coast rivers, the Hoping, the Hualien, and the Beinan, have high sediment yields that may be explained by relatively frequent earthquakes coupled with high runoff. Farming and urbanization also have elevated sediment yields in eastern watersheds, whereas Holocene sediments buried in the Taiwan Strait suggest that present-day sediment loads of the western rivers may be no higher than prehuman levels.","Coll William & Mary, Sch Marine Sci, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA.; Acad Sinica, Res Ctr Environm Changes, Taipei 115, Taiwan.; Xiamen Univ, State Key Lab Marine Environm Sci, Xiamen, Peoples R China.;",USA;TAIWAN;CHINA,USA,TAIWAN,2,2.0,,"Kao, SJ (corresponding author), POB 1-55, Taipei, Taiwan.","National Science Council of TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [NSC96-2628-M-001-028]; U.S. National Science Foundation and Naval Oceanographic Office","This study was supported by a grant to S.

2017.0,J. Geol.,Discussion of Suitable Chemical Weathering Proxies in Sediments by Comparing the Dissolution Rates of Minerals in Different Rocks,Lo F;Chen H;Fang J,"In studies of paleoclimate change, variations in major and minor elements are often used as proxies for chemical weathering in soil or lake sediments. To prove the suitability of chemical weathering proxies and further discuss the impact of mineral dissolution on element migrations, various parent rocks in Taiwan were chosen to react with sulfuric acid for discussing mineral dissolution rankings and element leaching during chemical weathering processes. The parent rocks include granite, andesite, actinolite schist, slate, quartz sandstone, calcium sandstone, and mudstone. Experimental results show that dissolution rates are mainly controlled by mineral structures and the chemical compositions of rocks. The ranking of rock dissolution rates is as follows: mudstone > slate > actinolite schist > quartz sandstone > granite. Dissolution rates of andesite and calcium sandstone cannot be compared due to secondary minerals being produced in experiments. Moreover, the dissolution sequences of minerals are of the following order: calcite > chlorite > muscovite and illite > augite > hornblende approximate to feldspar > quartz. This result is consistent with the stability of silicate polymerization. Most notable among the results was that the dissolution rates of clay minerals were faster than those of feldspar. Element migration ranking in dissolution processes is as follows: Mg > Ca approximate to Rb > K > Na > Sr > Al > Zr > Fe approximate to Ti. The dissolution rates of univalent elements follow the sequence of bonding forces; however, those of divalent elements are less ordered. This is due to divalent elements being rich in different mineral phases. Therefore, the study suggests that univalent elements are more suitable as chemical weathering proxy candidates. Moreover, whether ratios of Rb/Sr and K/Rb or chemical index of alteration values in sediments are suitable proxies of paleorainfall intensity is discussed in detail.","Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Inst Appl Geosci, Keelung 20224, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Museum, Dept Res, Taipei 10047, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,1.0,"Chen, HF (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Inst Appl Geosci, Keelung 20224, Taiwan.","National Taiwan Ocean University; National Science Council of TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [NSC-101-2116-M-019-001]",This study was supported by National Taiwan Ocean University and grants NSC-101-2116-M-019-001 from the National Science Council of Taiwan.

2019.0,J. Geol.,The Relationship between Basin Hypsometric Integral Scale Dependence and Rock Uplift Rate in a Range Front Area A Case Study from the Coastal Range Taiwan,Chen Y;Cheng K;Huang W;Sung Q;Tsai H,"The hypsometric curve and hypsometric integral (HI) of drainage basins are common tectonic geomorphologic indices. Generally, the hypsometric curve is convex and the HI is high in areas of strong rock uplift. However, previous research indicates that an inverse correlation exists between the HI and rock uplift in the mountain-piedmont junction in California. It has also been proposed that the basin HI in the range front area has scale dependence, which increases the difficulty of inferring tectonic uplift. We therefore examined the effects of tectonic uplift and basin scale on basin HI in the southern Coastal Range of eastern Taiwan. The results showed that basin size could affect the HI. First-order Strahler basins are smaller and have higher HIs, whereas second- and third-order basins are larger and have lower HIs, indicating some form of scale dependence. The coefficient of logarithmic regression between mean area and mean HI of every subbasin was calculated to determine the scale dependence index (SDI). The lower the SDI, the higher the scale dependence. The SDI was utilized to distinguish basins' topographic tendencies between range interior and range front. We also applied the igneous-area ratio to define spatial tendencies of basins' lithology distributions. The lower the igneous-area ratio, the greater the spatial tendency toward range front will be. Basins in the middle of the south Coastal Range tended to approach a range interior steady state, with higher SDIs and a positive correlation between HI and rock uplift rate. Basins in the north and south of the south Coastal Range tended to be at a range front nonsteady state, with lower SDIs and a negative correlation between HI and rock uplift rate. The correlations may be applicable to estimate the rock uplift rate.","Chia Nan Univ Pharm & Sci, Dept Tourism Management, Tainan 71710, Taiwan.;  Natl Changhua Univ Educ, Dept Geog, Changhua 50007, Taiwan.;  Chien Hsin Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Geoinformat & Disaster Reduct Technol, 229 Chien Hsin Rd, Taoyuan 320, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,5,1.0,0.0,"Tsai, H (corresponding author), Natl Changhua Univ Educ, Dept Geog, Changhua 50007, Taiwan.",,,,10.1086/701252,Article,HUA-TUNG COAST; MOUNTAIN-RANGES; DRAINAGE BASINS; INCISION MODEL; VELOCITY-FIELD; STEADY-STATE; GRADIENT; INDEXES; ISLAND; NORTH,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY,2,127,ISI,CHIA NAN UNIV PHARM AND SCI;NATL CHANGHUA UNIV EDUC;CHIEN HSIN UNIV SCI AND TECHNOL,NATL CHANGHUA UNIV EDUC,B2

To resolve this, the detrital archive of orogenesis preserved in Coastal Range rocks of eastern Taiwan was used to reconstruct the erosional response of arc collision. The spatial and temporal distribution of exhumation recorded in this detrital record is consistent with southwards progression of arc-continent collision in a punctuated rather than sequential manner with deposition confined to segmented foredeep basins. Apparent increases in sedimentation rates in Taiwan during the Pleistocene may not reflect increased erosion, but instead may be due to the collisional margin architecture.","Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh EH9 3JW, Midlothian, Scotland.;  Birkbeck Coll, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, London WC1E 7HX, England.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei 10764, Taiwan.;",UNITED KINGDOM;UNITED KINGDOM;TAIWAN,UNITED KINGDOM,UNITED KINGDOM,3,3.0,2.0,"Kirstein, LA (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh EH9 3JW, Midlothian, Scotland.",NERCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/E012426/1]; Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/E012426/1] Funding Source: researchfish,"L.A.K. wishes to thank B.

Despite its importance in the Taiwan mountain belt, the structure and kinematics of the Shuilikeng fault are not well known. Here, we present results from new geological mapping along 100 km of its strike length. At the surface, the Shuilikeng fault is a steeply east-dipping brittle fault with a series of splays and bifurcations. Along its southern part, it cuts an earlier fold and fault system. Outcrop kinematic data vary widely, from thrusting to strike-slip. The surface data are integrated with a relocated and collapsed seismicity database to interpret the fault location at depth. These data indicate that the Shuilikeng fault can be traced to greater than 20 km depth. Some 260 focal mechanisms from this dataset indicate that its kinematics is overall transpressive. From a regional perspective, we interpret the Shuilikeng fault to reactivate a pre-existing rift-related basin-bounding fault to the east of which rocks in the Hsuehshan Range are being exhumed.","ICTJA CSIC, Inst Earth Sci Jaume Almera, Barcelona 08028, Spain.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei 106, Taiwan.;",SPAIN;TAIWAN,SPAIN,SPAIN,5,2.0,2.0,"Camanni, G (corresponding author), ICTJA CSIC, Inst Earth Sci Jaume Almera, Lluis Sole i Sabaris S-N, Barcelona 08028, Spain.","CSIC-Proyectos Intramurales [301010, CGL2009-11843-BTE]; JAE-Predoc","We would like to thank L.-Y.

2015.0,J. Geol. Soc.,Sedimentation in remnant ocean basin off SW Taiwan with implication for closing northeastern South China Sea,Hsiung K;Yu H;Su M,"Taiwan is one of the most cited examples of modern mountain building in an oblique arc-continent collision. However, the recognition and significance of the Taiwan remnant ocean basin in the final stages of the collision of Luzon with the Chinese margin have long been ignored. This paper emphasizes the Taiwan remnant ocean basin as the main sink for sediments from the uplifted Taiwan suture zone and as a record of clues to the suturing history of the Taiwan collision zone. A part of the palaeo South China Sea has been closed by oblique collision of the Luzon Arc with the Chinese margin in the Taiwan region since about 4 Ma. As collision continued southward along the Taiwan-Luzon convergent zone the remaining South China Sea off SW Taiwan became the Taiwan remnant ocean basin. Beginning about 1.6 Ma much sediment from the longitudinal drainage of the Taiwan orogen was fed into this remaining basin and trapped in the intra-slope basins of the Kaoping slope, with some sediment bypassing via the Kaoping Canyon to the lower reach of the Penghu Canyon. This basin is characteristic of an axial canyon-deep-sea channel-oceanic trench system without significant sediment accumulation in submarine fans. Excess sediments from the Penghu Canyon mainly spill over out of the closing basin to the South China Sea and Manila Trench via the deep-sea Penghu Channel. The Taiwan-Luzon convergent zone continues along the NE South China Sea where the Taiwan remnant ocean basin exists. The implication of the convergence is that the Taiwan remnant ocean basin will keep shrinking in the next few million years southward to the northern end of the Manila Trench at around 20 degrees N, where collision is replaced by subduction. The remnant ocean basin would be closed and deformed, and sediments would be accreted to uplifted collisional terranes north of the Manila Trench.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, Taipei 10764, Taiwan.;  Chinese Acad Sci, Guangzhou Inst Energy Convers, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;",TAIWAN;CHINA,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,,"Hsiung, KH (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, Taipei 10764, Taiwan.","National Science Council, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [NSC 103-2917-I-564-013]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41372112]","We greatly appreciate R.

2019.0,J. Geol. Soc.,Detrital zircon record from major rivers of Luzon Island implications for Cenozoic continental growth in SE Asia,Tsai C;Shyu J;Chung S;Ramos N;Lee H,"The significance of continental crustal growth in the Phanerozoic has long been debated. As an active accretionary orogenic belt, SE Asia has been proposed to be one of the best archives for studying juvenile continental growth in the Cenozoic, despite the limited availability of data. Therefore, we conducted for the first time a comprehensive U-Pb and Hf isotopic analysis of detrital zircons separated from major rivers of Luzon Island, the largest landmass of the Philippine Archipelago. U-Pb ages of these zircons are predominantly <50 Ma, consistent with literature zircon U-Pb ages or whole-rock K-Ar ages. A sample from the central Sierra Madre, however, contains zircons with age clusters at 110-70 and 180-140 Ma, supporting the presence of Mesozoic basement rock units in that area. All dated zircons show positive and high epsilon Hf(T) values that plot close to the depleted mantle. Therefore, we argue that pre-Cenozoic continental materials played insignificant roles in the construction of Luzon Island, and that this part of the southeastern Eurasian margin consists predominantly of a juvenile terrane where substantial continental crustal growth occurred in the Cenozoic.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Univ Oxford, Dept Earth Sci, Oxford, England.;  Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Univ Philippines, Coll Sci, Natl Inst Geol Sci, Quezon City, Philippines.;",TAIWAN;UNITED KINGDOM;TAIWAN;PHILIPPINES,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,5,1.0,,"Shyu, JBH (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) of TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [104-2116-M-002-027-MY4, 105-2923-M-008-003-MY3]",This research was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) of Taiwan (104-2116-M-002-027-MY4 and 105-2923-M-008-003-MY3 to J.B.H.S.).,,10.1144/jgs2019-003,Article,PACIFIC-TYPE OROGENY; U-PB; TRACE-ELEMENT; PHILIPPINE OPHIOLITES; TECTONIC EVOLUTION; ARC; SUBDUCTION; TAIWAN; MODEL; ROCKS,GEOLOGICAL SOC PUBL HOUSE,JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY,4,176,ISI,NATL TAIWAN UNIV;UNIV OXFORD;INST EARTH SCI;UNIV PHILIPPINES,NATL TAIWAN UNIV,A
1996.0,J. Geol. Soc. China,40Ar39Ar dating of highpressure rocks in the tananao basement complex Taiwan,Lo C;Yui T,"The appearance of the glaucophane schists and the omphacite-bearing rocks in the Yuli Belt of the Tananao Basement Complex indicates that a high-pressure metamorphic event occurred in Taiwan. The precise message of these high-pressure metamorphic rocks on the regional tectonic evolution history, however, is not yet clear mainly because of the complicated thermal history and the rarity of reliable geochronological data. To delineate the geohistory of these rocks, amphibole, phengite, phlogopite and omphacite separated from one glaucophane schist and two omphacite-bearing rocks were analyzed by using the 40Ar/39Ar dating technique. Omphacite and phlogopite separated from the omphacite-bearing rocks yield 40Ar/39Ar dates of 100-110 Ma and 4.4±0.1 Ma, respectively. Two phengite fractions of different grain size extracted from the glaucophane schist sample exhibit flat age spectra with consistent plateau dates of 10.4±0.1 Ma and 11.3±01 Ma. However, the age spectrum of amphibole from the glaucophane schist displays a disturbed shape with a geologically meaningless total gas age of 20.1±0.2 Ma. Such a disturbed isotopic system may be interpreted as resulting from mixing of two radiogenic Ar components which exhibit 40Ar/39Ar dates of ∼110 Ma and 12.2 Ma, respectively. Based on these results, three major conclusions could be made: (1) the high-pressure metamorphic event in Taiwan, as disclosed by the 40Ar/ 39Ar dates of omphacite and amphibole took place during 110-100 Ma; (2) the K-Ar isotopic systems of most of the minerals in these high-pressure rocks have been significantly affected by the thermal event of the late Tertiary Penglai Orogeny; and (3) the thermal event of the Penglai Orogeny may have occurred since as early as ca. 11 Ma ago.","Institute of Geology, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan; Institute of Earth Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,,"Lo, C.-H.; Institute of Geology, , Taipei, Taiwan",,NA NA,40Ar-39Ar dating;  Geochronology;  High-pressure metamorphism;  Tananao schist,,Article,argon-40/argon-39 dating;  high pressure metamorphism; Taiwan; Tananao Complex,,Journal of the Geological Society of China,50,39,scopus,NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY;INSTITUTE OF EARTH SCIENCES,INSTITUTE OF GEOLOGY,X
1996.0,J. Geol. Soc. China,A study on hokutolite synthesis and its mineralogical implications to natural occurrences,Lee J;Yu S,"Synthetic hokutolite samples with chemical compositions different from natural crystals were grown in the present study with the solutions of Pb(NO3)2, Ba(NO3)2 and (NH4)2SO4 as starting materials. All the growth processes were carried out at 90-98°C and ambient pressure conditions for the growth period of 3-4 days. The synthetic hokutolite samples exhibit a well-developed crystal form with only a few crystals showing extensive surface defects. The present study reveals that hokutolite crystals can be grown with compositions covering the whole solid solution series of PbSO4 and BaSO4, unlike the limited PbSO4 content (21 to 32 mol%) observed in natural specimens. A variation in the growth rate of the synthetic hokutolite as a function of chemical composition was observed. X-ray measurements indicate that both the ao and bo crystallographic axes decrease with increasing PbSO4, while the co axis does not display the significant variation throughout the entire solid solution range. The inferior crystallinity of the synthetic hokutolite crystals may be closely related to the existence of the domain substructures in the samples. This work also suggests that the chemical compositions of natural hokutolite in the Peito area may have been controlled by the hot spring source materials which originated from the post-volcanic activity of Pleistocene volcanoes.","Department of Earth Sciences, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,,"Lee, J.-S.; Department of Earth Sciences, , Tainan, Taiwan",,NA NA,Complete solid solution;  Natural hokutolite;  Synthetic hokutolite,,Article,crystal structure;  hokutolite; Taiwan; Peitou,,Journal of the Geological Society of China,3,39,scopus,NATIONAL CHENG KUNG UNIVERSITY,DEPARTMENT OF EARTH SCIENCES,X
1996.0,J. Geol. Soc. China,Channel morphology on the eastern slope of the Coastal Range in Taiwan,Chang J,"The Coastal Range is the most active tectonic area in Taiwan. Subject to continual stress coming from the southeast, the Coastal Range has been deformed by several faults and folds. Besides, uplift has led to the emergence of marine terraces in the coastal area. Due to the heterogeneous resistance of rock, various geological structure and differential uplift, most rivers have a straight course with gorge and intrenched valley in the steep slopeland, but ingrown meanders and intrenched meanders in the gentle slopeland and basin areas. In the alluvial fan and coastal area, channels are marked by straight course or meander depending on the slope. Responding to the baselevel lowering, a river adjusts by changing channel form depending on the magnitude and rate of baselevel change, valley slope and magnitude. It is concluded that the channel morphology is controlled by the resistance of rock, terrain topography, geological structure and tectonic movement.","Department of Geography, National Taiwan Normal University, Taipei, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,1,1.0,,"Chang, J.-C.; Department of Geography, , Taipei, Taiwan",,NA NA,Channel morphology;  Coastal Range (eastern Taiwan);  Sinuosity,,Article,base level lowering;  baselevel lowering;  channel morphology;  emergence;  neotectonics;  sinuosity;  uplift; Taiwan; Coastal Range,,Journal of the Geological Society of China,0,39,scopus,NATIONAL TAIWAN NORMAL UNIVERSITY,NOTREPORTED,X

China,Crustal structures estimated from arrival differences of the first Pwaves in Taiwan,Lin C,"A statistical relation between epicentral distance (X) and observed apparent velocity (V) has been constructed to estimate the average crustal P-wave velocity structures in the Taiwan area. The relation was derived from 17,502 apparent velocities of the first P-waves that were generated by 1,111 local shallow earthquakes and recorded at a regional telemeter seismic network (CWBSN) in Taiwan during the period from March 1991 to October 1994. Each apparent velocity was simply determined from the arrival difference between two close stations. Apparent velocities were obtained at various epicentral distances ranging from 50 to 300 km. To estimate velocity structures, the statistical relation of (X, V) was compared with the theoretical results calculated from assumed multi-layer models. The best P-wave velocity model to fit the statistical relation of (X, V) suggests that the maximum crust thickness probably reaches up to about 50 km, and that the upper crust has about double the thickness of the lower crust in the major part of Taiwan.","Institute of Earth Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,1,1.0,,"Lin, C.-H.; Institute of Earth Sciences, , Taipei, Taiwan",,NA NA,Apparent velocity;  Crustal structure;  First arrival difference,,Article,crustal structure;  P wave;  seismic velocity structure; Taiwan,,Journal of the Geological Society of China,11,39,scopus,INSTITUTE OF EARTH SCIENCES,INSTITUTE OF EARTH SCIENCES,X

1996.0,J. Geol. Soc. China,Gravel orientation and their shapes distribution appear to effect slope grade in northwestern Taiwan,Chen H;Tsai B,"The orientation of lateritic gravels and their slope distribution in northwestern Taiwan appear to effect slope stability. The results of in-situ investigation demonstrate that a scarp slope will be found when the intersected angle of strike on the gravel orientation and slope surface is 180°. By contrast, when the intersected angle is 0°, there is a dip slope geometry. When the intersected angle ranges from 0° to 180°, the slope grade will increase and have an angle of from 50° to 80°. The results indicate a positive correlation between the two. When the disk and bladed gravels increase their percentage relative to the material composition, the slope grade will increase. On the other hand, when the proportion of equant and roller shapes increase in the composition, the slope grade will decrease. The results of the study areas demonstrate that the gravel shape and its orientation still effect slope grade even when the matrix strength is constant. When the fine fraction content is over 30% in the matrix support of lateritc gravels, gravel shapes and their orientation can still effect the stability of such a slope.","Department of Geology, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan; Taiwan Area Natl.

A comparison between the calculated and observed gravity anomalies shows that the basement-involved model significantly surpasses the thin-skinned models in fitting the data.

1996.0,J. Geol. Soc. China,Investigation of active faults by ground penetrating radar along highway 3 Omi northwestern Taiwan,Yang C;Hung Y,"Great population density and rapid industrial development in Taiwan have given rise to ever increasing demands for land. In order to meet this need, newly developed community sites must be planned in advance; however, as Taiwan is located along the neotectonic belt surrounding the Pacific Ocean, active fault detection is one of the most essential tasks for the earthquake risk analysis of different sites. Detecting shallow faults is thus one of the most important responsibilities for site investigation. The objective of this study was to assess the potential application of ground penetrating radar (GPR) to detect active faults in northwestern Taiwan. Three sites along highway #3 near Fu-hsintai, O-mi, northwestern Taiwan were selected. Each site has its own characteristics. A roadcut underneath site #1 allowed interpretation of the GPR results with the maximum amount of geologic control. Site #2 is located on a slope, where/and a gravel layer is unconformably overlying on dipping layers of sandstone and clay alternations. Topographic corrections for the field GPR data had to be done before the data was processed. Site #3 is located in front of a steep outcrop consisting of alternations of sandstone and mudstone, a thrust fault with a maximum throw of 3 m cross-cutting the vertical surface of the outcrops. From studying the images of subsurface spatial stratigraphy from the characters of radar sections, fault zones can be recognized in those sites. Comparing the observed radar sections with the modeled radar results, these fault zones can be distinguished more definitely. The GPR technique clearly demonstrated its capability of resolving local fault problems.","Institute of Applied Geology, National Central University, Chungli, Taiwan",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,,"Yang, C.-H.; Institute of Applied Geology, , Chungli, Taiwan",,NA NA,Active fault;  GPR,,Article,fault;  fault detection;  GPR;  ground penetrating radar;  neotectonics;  site investigation;  tectonics; Taiwan,,Journal of the Geological Society of China,6,39,scopus,NATIONAL CENTRAL UNIVERSITY,INSTITUTE OF APPLIED GEOLOGY,X

Based on recent geochemical studies in Taiwan and adjacent regions, some igneous rocks, e.g., the ""enriched"" andesite in Lutao and the highly potassic basalt in Tsaolingshan, show a strongly enriched incompatible trace element composition far beyond that of common rock standards. It is therefore highly necessary to prepare new secondary rock standards suitable for geochemical analyses of rock samples from Taiwan and elsewhere. Six rock standards, termed as NTUG (National Taiwan University, Department of Geology) were selected in different localities, including (1) Penghu alkali basalt, (2) Wannienta olivine basalt, (3) Kuanyinshan two-pyroxene andesite, (4) Lutao pyroxene-hornblende andesite and (5) Chinmen biotite granite and (6) gneiss. Major and trace element compositions for these rocks have been carried out by INAA, ICP-AES, ICP-MS and XRF methods. Whereas their tentative recommended values are given in this paper, further studies in terms of other techniques and more interlaboratory calibrations are needed.

1996.0,J. Geol. Soc. China,Numerical simulation of neotectonics near Peikang high,Jeng F;Hsiao M;Lu C,"Neotectonic deformation near the Peikang basement high induces a sequence of phenomena, such as the development of faults, the occurrence of earthquakes and the detainment of displacement of the Western Foothills near the boundary of the Peikang high. In this paper, the neotectonic deformation near the Peikang high was simulated using a finite element computer code, ABAQUS. Infinite elements, interface elements and a measure of failure possibility were adopted to provide improvements in modeling the interfaces of the geological strata, reducing the number of elements, providing adequate boundary conditions and evaluating the possibility of faulting. The simulated results were then compared to the existing phenomena including the occurrences of micro-earthquakes, configuration of faults and displacement field measured by the Global Positioning System (GPS). The simulated results indicate that the induced strain energy is greater in the southern region than in the northern region, which explains why there are more earthquakes in the southern region. The simulated displacement field agrees with GPS records and reveals the occurrence of right and left lateral faults. Based on the simulation of vertical plane deformation, the location of thrust faults would occur at the rear of the up-thrusting block, which is consistent with field observations. The frictional effect of interfaces between the two main geological units (the Peikang high and the Western Foothills) was also evaluated. The results indicate that the increase in friction disperses the strain energy to a larger region, and the best fit of the friction angle is estimated to be about 10 to 20 degrees. Furthermore, the effect of relative stiffness was studied.","Department of Civil Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Geology, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,,"Jeng, F.-S.; Department of Civil Engineering, , Taipei, Taiwan",,NA NA,Basement high;  Neotectonics;  Numerical simulation,,Article,basement high;  deformation;  fault;  finite element method;  neotectonics;  seismicity;  tectonics; Taiwan; Peikang High,,Journal of the Geological Society of China,6,39,scopus,NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY;NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY,NOTREPORTED,X
1996.0,J. Geol. Soc. China,Possible links between the development of PlioPleistocene coral reef limestones and thrust migration in southwestern Taiwan,Gong S;Lee T;Wu J;Wang S;Yang K,"The southwestern Taiwan is part of a Plio-Pleistocene foreland basin filled with thick siliciclastic sediments. Embedded in these sequences are several lenticular reef limestones which are characterized by: (1) a rapid transition from underlying deep-water siliciclastic mudstones upward to reef limestones, (2) a lateral interfingering with deep-water siliciclastics, (3) an overlay of terrestrial deposits or of no other strata, implying an emergence above sea level since the reef formation, and (4) a location closely associated with anticlines. The authors propose that the majority of the Pleistocene reef limestones in southwestern Taiwan, including the Tudikungchi, Takangshan, Hsiaokangshan, Panpingshan and Kaohsiung Limestones, were deposited on local structural highs formed by thrust-induced anticlinal ridges that resulted from the cratonward migration of the orogen. They also speculate that the overall age-spatial distributions of these reef limestones could possibly represent thrust-front migration of the foreland basin.","National Museum of Natural Science, Taichung, Taiwan; Department of Earth Sciences, National Taiwan Normal University, Taipei, Taiwan; Explor. and Devmt.

It is the objective of this research to study the secondary compression behavior of the silty clay of the Taipei Basin. The traditional one-dimensional consolidation tests were performed, and the secondary compression behavior was observed. The ratio of the secondary compression index to the compression index is approximately 0.0274 for the silty clay of the Taipei Basin. The model proposed by Mesri and the rheological model by Gibson and Lo were used for interpretation of the secondary compression testing results and were then applied in the analyses of a field case.

The purpose is to investigate the shallow geology in the study area and surroundings. Interpretations are made by integrating the seismic data from this experiment and information from other geological or geophysical methods. Seismic profiles from this experiment show that the shallow geological layers in the complete survey area are nearly flat. Folding in the area is very limited. By combining the seismic profiles with drill core data, it is further determined that these shallow geological layers are composed of unconsolidated Quaternary sediments.

Multichannel seismic profiles reveal the seismic characteristics and infer the sedimentary processes forming the canyon. In the upper canyon, the seismic profiles reveal slumping features and the termination of parallel reflectors against the steep canyon walls, suggesting erosional canyon downcutting. In the lower canyon segments, seismic configurations illustrate relatively flat reflectors onlapping the canyon bottom, resulting from sediment infilling. Two types of canyon fills are recognized: a chaotic fill and a mounded onlap fill, both suggesting gravity mass transport. On the basis of seismic interpretations, this canyon can be divided into two parts: an upcanyon erosional zone and a downcanyon mixed depositional and erosional zone. The course of the Kaohsiung Canyon is remarkably short and straight but with no distributaries as compared to the adjacent long and sinuous Kaoping Canyon. The cross-sectional morphology changes from V-shaped in the upcanyon sections (erosional zone) to U-shaped in the downcanyon sections (depositional and erosional zone). The seismic data provide no evidence for a fault zone along the canyon course. Rather, downslope submarine excavation is the major process forming the canyon.","Institute of Oceanography, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,,"Yu, H.O.-S.; Institute of Oceanography, , Taipei, Taiwan",,NA NA,Seismics;  Submarine canyon;  Taiwan,,Article,mass transport;  seismic characteristics;  seismic survey;  submarine canyon;  submarine canyons; South China Sea; Kaohsiung Canyon,,Journal of the Geological Society of China,8,39,scopus,NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY,INSTITUTE OF OCEANOGRAPHY,X
1996.0,J. Geol. Soc. China,Source parameters of the December 15 1993 Tapu earthquake from firstP motions and waveforms,Huang B;Chen K;Yeh Y,"On December 15, 1993, an earthquake of ML=5.8 occurred in Tapu, 34 km south of Chia-i, Taiwan. This earthquake was the largest occurring in southern Taiwan in the past thirty years. The event was recorded by both the local short-period seismic network and the digital strong motion array of the Central Weather Bureau (CWB). A method was proposed to determine the source parameters using both data sets. On the basis of the epicenter as determined by the short-period seismic network, the source depth was estimated at 20 km by the S-P time, the time difference between S- and P-arrivals, using strong motion data. Not just the short-period but also strong motion first-P motion data were used to determine the source mechanism of this event. From the modeling of the three-component displacement waveforms based on the determined source mechanism, the moment and other source parameters were determined. The results from a constrained modeling of the near source waveform showed a thrust fault with a strike of 12°, a dip of 52°, a rake of 70°, a source time duration of 1.0 sec, a seismic moment of 2.4× 1024 dyne-cm and a stress drop of 320 bars. The method proposed in this study also proved itself successful in determining the source parameters of small events. With the same technique applied to the aftershock on January 3, 1994, well constrained source parameters were estimated with a strike of 12°, a dip of 65°, a rake of 5°, a source time duration of 0.6 sec, a moment of 2× 1023 dyne-cm and a stress drop of 124 bars. The maximum compression axes of both source mechanisms were consistent with the major earthquakes and the regional stress direction in this area.","Institute of Earth Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan; Institute of Seismology, National Chung Cheng University, Chia-I, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,,"Huang, B.-S.; Institute of Earth Sciences, , Taipei, Taiwan",,NA NA,Source mechanism;  Strong motion waveform;  Tapu earthquake,,Article,focal mechanism;  source parameters;  Tapu earthquake 1993; Taiwan; Tapu,,Journal of the Geological Society of China,11,39,scopus,INSTITUTE OF EARTH SCIENCES;NATIONAL CHUNG CHENG UNIVERSITY,INSTITUTE OF EARTH SCIENCES,X

China,Study on the correlation between slope failure occurrence time and rainfall data A case study on ALiSan Highway,Chen S,"This project attempts to correlate the relationship between slope failure occurrence time and rainfall data along the A-Li-San Highway of Taiwan. It is believed that the results of this study will help to establish a landslide warning system in the future. About ten years' worth of data on rainfall and slope failure obtained from weather stations near the highway and highway maintenance unit have been collected and analyzed. Field measurements were carried out to determine the geological and topographical data of the rock slopes both for failed and unfailed slopes. This study yields two important result. First, the SMR(slope mass rating) method can be used to classify the stability of natural rock slopes along the highway. Statistically, the higher the SMR values of the rock slopes, the larger amount of rainfall is required to fail them. The SMR values corrected with the height-steepness factor show even better result. The second important result of this study is that the occurrence rate of slope failure along A-Li-San Highway can be expressed by the following formula: Occurrence Rate (%) = 20.59 + 1.281 + 0.11P where I = the maximum 3-hour duration rainfall intensity of a rainstorm, in mm/hr; P = cumulative rainfall, in mm. Nevertheless the slope failure is only expected to occur when the cumulative rainfall is greater than 80 mm for a rainstorm.","Dept. of Mineral and Petrol.

China,The crustal evolution of continental Taiwan,Lan C;Chen C;Chen C;Chung S;Lee T;Lee C;Yui T,"Based on isotopic and geologic data published in the past decade, the crustal evolution of the western continental part of Taiwan is summarized. The data show that the middle Proterozoic era was the most important period in terms of crustal formation and that the continental crust thus formed became a major protolith incorporated in the generation of younger Taiwan rocks. The crustal history of continental Taiwan began in the late Paleozoic (250±20 Ma). Four episodes of mantle inputs since then can be delineated: (1) the early Mesozoic event (200-175 Ma) in the metapelites of the Tananao metamorphic basement complex; (2) the late Mesozoic event (97-77 Ma) in the granitoids of the Tananao metamorphic basement complex; (3) the Cenozoic event (37-8 Ma) in the intraplate basalts of the Western Foothills of Taiwan; and (4) the ongoing event (3 Ma to present) in the recent volcanics of northern Taiwan. The first event is believed to have been a consequence of early Yanshanian thermal activity, whereas the second event could have been affiliated with the subduction of a paleo-Pacific plate. The third event resulted from continental extension in the SE China Continental Margin. As a response to arc-continent collision, the last event may be attributed to the change from a compressive to a dilational tectonic regime in the northern Taiwan orogen during the late Tertiary to Quaternary, rather than related directly to the Ryukyu subduction zone magmatism as commonly suggested.","Institute of Earth Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan; Institute of Geology, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,7,1.0,,"Lan, C.-Y.; Institute of Earth Sciences, , Taipei, Taiwan",,NA NA,Crustal evolution;  Mantle input;  Taiwan,,Article,continental crust;  crustal development;  orogenesis;  tectonic evolution; Taiwan,,Journal of the Geological Society of China,6,39,scopus,INSTITUTE OF EARTH SCIENCES;NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY,INSTITUTE OF EARTH SCIENCES,X
1996.0,J. Geol. Soc. China,The crystal structure of vesuvianites from Taiwan,Lee J;Yu S,"The crystal structure of two vesuvianites in rodingite from the Yu-Ii area, Taiwan, were determined from data collected on a Nonius CAD-4 four-circle diffractometer. Two samples are brown and green in color, respectively. The results indicate that the brown vesuvianites have high Ti content and that the increase in Ti is fairly well correlated with the decrease in Al. In contrast, the green ones are characterized by a very low Ti concentration. Very low fluorine and boron content in these two samples were also noted. The two samples belong to the space group of P4/nnc and have similar chemistry and cell parameters (a=15.547,15.508Å; c=11.833, 11.815Å. Full-matrix least squares refinement of the structure, including anisotropic temperature factors, gave conventional and weighted R values of 6.72, 3.61 and 6.60, 4.49 %, respectively for these two specimens. The structures are virtually identical, and very similar to that proposed by Coda et al. (1970). The refinement results show the position for the H atom at the distance of about 0.6 Å from O(11). According to the analysis of a difference Fourier synthesis, the bond-valence calculations and relationship between B-O(10) and O(10)-O(10) distance, it demonstrates that another H atom should bond to O(10). Cations in vesuvianites are mainly confined to the 6-fold AlFesites (Al, Fe, Mg, Ti) and 5-fold B-sites (Fe, Al, Mg). The 4-fold sites are filled with Si, the 8-fold sites with Ca (minor Na), and the 6-fold A-sites with Al. Furthermore, along the 4-fold axis of the structure, adjacent B-sites (tetrahedral pyramid) and C-sites (square antiprism) are half occupied because of the close cation-cation distance of about 1.4A.","Department of Earth Sciences, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,,"Lee, J.-S.; Department of Earth Sciences, , Tainan, Taiwan",,NA NA,Brown vesuvianite;  Crystal structure;  Difference Fourier analysis;  Green vesuvianite,,Article,crystal structure;  vesuvianite; Taiwan; Yu-li,,Journal of the Geological Society of China,0,39,scopus,NATIONAL CHENG KUNG UNIVERSITY,DEPARTMENT OF EARTH SCIENCES,X
1996.0,J. Geol. Soc. China,The investigation of landslides and stability analyses of slopes along the roads in the NanHwa Reservoir watershed area,Wang H;Lo P;Tsai K;Lin J,"The Nan-Hwa Reservoir, located at Nan-Hwa, Tainan County, is well recognized as an important hydraulic construction in southwestern Taiwan. The reservoir area is selected as the major study area in this project due to the occurrence of disastrous landslides there. The watershed of the Nan-Hwa Reservoir is 108.29 square kilometers in size with thirty-six creeks. The major traffic routes in the reservoir area are Pin-Ken Road, Kun-Sen Road, County Road 179 and Provincial Highway 20. Along the major roads, a total of 43 landslides and 24 disposal fields of dumped soils, resulting from the construction of Road 179, are investigated. The fields of dumped soils, located at 10k+230m on Road 179, is selected to explore the mechanical characteristics and stability of these wasted materials after being disturbed by human activity in the mudstone areas. The research mainly contains field tests and laboratory experiments. The field tests include surveys on disposal fields of dumped soil, geological investigations, field soil density determinations and sieve analyses of soils. In laboratory, soil compaction tests, consolidation tests, direct shear tests, tri-axial tests, and basic determenations of soil mechanical characteristics are conducted. Compaction tests in this research are based on the ASTM D698-A and the AASHTO T99-A method. Slope stability analyses are performed by use of the computer program STABLE V. The results show that the disturbed mudstone works satisfactorily in slope stabilities between 90% and 95% relative compaction.

The mechanisms of groundwater salinization were diagnosed by measurements of isotopic analyses in this study. Two main processes are identified as being responsible for the stable isotope enrichment in groundwaters: (1) the intrusion of sea water, and (2) the mixing of isotope-enriched surface water into the aquifer. The major reason for groundwater salinization has been sea water encroachment resulting from the overpumping of groundwater by farmers using freshwater aquaculture in this area. In order to alleviate groundwater salinization, measures and regulations with regard to safe drawing control for groundwaters should be strictly adopted and enforced in the coastal areas of Taiwan.","Institute of Earth Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Geology, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,,"Wang, C.-H.; Institute of Earth Sciences, , Taipei, Taiwan",,NA NA,Groundwater;  I-Lan;  Salinization;  Stable isotope,,Article,aquifer;  groundwater;  groundwater abstraction;  groundwater resources;  salinization;  seawater intrusion;  water quality;  water resources; Taiwan; Lan-Yang Plain,,Journal of the Geological Society of China,6,39,scopus,INSTITUTE OF EARTH SCIENCES;NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY,INSTITUTE OF EARTH SCIENCES,X
1996.0,J. Geol. Soc. China,δ13CPDB variations in contemporary bryophytes and the constraint on its use as a proxy of paleoatmospheric CO2 contents,Yeh H;Kao W,"One potential proxy of the concentration records of the paleoatmospheric CO2 is the δ13C values of organic sediments. However, factors other than the δ13C values and concentration of the atmospheric CO2, such as ambient air humidity, are also important in controlling the δ13C values of terrestrial plants. In order to overcome the ""humidity problem"", fossil bryophyte samples were recently analyzed to reconstruct the concentration records. However, since the concentrations and the δ13C values of forest air CO2 are probably heterogeneous and different from those of the atmospheric CO2, δ13C values of bryophyte samples shall then reflect the records of the forest air rather than the atmospheric CO2. In this study, a suite of contemporary bryophyte samples were analyzed to test this hypothesis. The samples were collected from a small area of the forest in the Yuen-Yang Lake Natural Reserve Area. The δ13CPDB values of the samples analyzed in this study ranged from -26.1 to -30.77‰, with a spread of 4.6‰. Based on these δ13CPDB values, these bryophyte samples appear to be C3-plants. The 4.6‰ spread is for all the samples analyzed, which consisted of five different species of bryophytes. In terms of single species variation, the spread is 2.5‰. It can be argued that the spreads are a result of the isotopic heterogeneity of the forest air CO2 and that, in general, the forest air CO2 and the atmospheric CO2 are different in their δ13C values and concentration levels. This phenomenon had to be dealt with when the δ13C values of fossil bryophyte samples were used to reconstruct the concentration records of paleoatmospheric CO2. The seriousness of the phenomenon is fully appreciated in view of the fact that the full range of fluctuation of the δ13C values of the averaged atmospheric CO2 of the last one hundred and sixty thousand years is probably only within 2.0‰.","Institute of Earth Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan; Institute of Botany, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,,"Yeh, H.-W.; Institute of Earth Sciences, , Taipei, Taiwan",,NA NA,Bryophytes;  C3-plant;  Carbon isotopes;  Forest air;  Paleoatmospheric CO2,,Article,atmospheric carbon dioxide;  bryophyte;  forest air;  palaeoatmosphere;  palaeoclimate; Taiwan; Yuen-Yang Lake Natural Reserve,,Journal of the Geological Society of China,2,39,scopus,INSTITUTE OF EARTH SCIENCES;INSTITUTE OF BOTANY,INSTITUTE OF EARTH SCIENCES,X
1997.0,J. Geol. Soc. China,A study of the effects of source scaling on seismic zonation in southwestern Taiwan,Tsai C,"The effects of seismic source scaling of the Tachienshan-Chukou fault system in southwestern Taiwan on seismic zonation are investigated in this study. To simplify the problem, this fault system is assumed to be the only seismic source in the area of interest. The attenuation of strong ground motions is modeled by the modififed specific barrier model developed for ground motion simulation in the near-source regime. Probabilistic seismic hazard analyses are evaluated for sites in the vicinity of the fault system. It has been found that the scaling relationship of corner frequency and seismic moment can be extended to that of fault rupture length and earthquake magnitude. The hazard assessments at sites close to the fault system are not very sensitive to the scaling relationship of the fault provided that the attenuation equation is kept invariant. The attenuation of ground motion is the major factor that affects the results of seismic hazard analyses. With respect to a return period of 475 yr, a peak ground acceleration of 0.8 g is a possible value for sites close to the Tachienshan-Chukou fault system.","Institute of Earth Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,1,1.0,,"Institute of Earth Sciences, , Taipei, Taiwan",,NA NA,,,Article,seismic hazard;  seismic moment;  source corner frequency; Taiwan,,Journal of the Geological Society of China,0,40,scopus,INSTITUTE OF EARTH SCIENCES,INSTITUTE OF EARTH SCIENCES,X
1997.0,J. Geol. Soc. China,Alkane distributions and their geochemical significance in the TzaiKang core of the Coastal Plain southwestern Taiwan,Oung J;Sung Q;Lin Y;Liu T;Yang C,"The Tzai-kang core from the southwestern Coastal Plain was analyzed by GC-MS for biomarkers including n-alkanes, triterpanes, and steranes. The alkane distributions indicate that hydrocarbons of various origins, such as reworked sedimentary rocks from the catchment area, biogenic terrestrial higher plants and, ocasionally, microbial algae/microbial, are present in the Coastal Plailn. The dominance of fossil hydrocarbons reflects the poor preservation of the biological organic matter and great dilution effects caused by a high sedimentary rate in the southwestern Coastal Plain. Organic origins and processes occurring during the transportation and after the deposition are recorded in the alkane distribution. Attempts have been made to correlate the n-alkane distribution with the depositional environment. It is shown that the n-alkane distributions reflect the non-marine environments by showing relatively higher amounts of terrestrial n-alkanes in the range of n-C27-n-C33 derived from terrestrial higher plants. On the other hand, the samples of the lagoonal environmental always show significantly higher amounts of low molecular weight n-alkanes ranging from n-C15 to n-C20 which are related to the algae/microbial origin. This correlation infers that n-alkane distributions in the Tzai-kang core might, to some extent, reflect the environmental changes indicated by foraminifera examination.","Offshore Overseas Petrol.

China,Calcite twin analysis of the Tungho and Kangkou limestones in the Coastal Range eastern Taiwan,Lin C;Lee Y,"The Tungho and Kangkou Limestones of the Coastal Range in eastern Taiwan have been deformed during the arc-continent collision since Pliocene. The stress and strain states of these deformed limestones are determined from the analysis of calcite twin lamellae. The present study shows that most limestones have suffered only a single phase of deformation under compressional stress. The derived maximum principal stress (σ1) is close to h orizontal and trends mainly in the range of 100° to 140° in azimuth. The directions of the σ2 and σ3 are either near horizontal or vertical and their magnitudes are nearly equal. Beside the compressional stress, other stress state responsible for normal faulting is also identified in few limestones around the Chinpu basin. This stress state is believed to have existed prior to the accretion of the Luzon volcanic arc. The strains measured in the deformed limestones are all less than 4%. The magnitude of strain decreases southward in the Kanghou Limestone but is rather random in the Tungho Limestone. The orientations of the principal strains are generally consistent with those of the principal stresses and reflect a nearly co-axial strain condition.","Department of Earth Sciences, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; United Geotechnology Inc., Taipei, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,,"Department of Earth Sciences, , Tainan, Taiwan",,NA NA,,,Article,arc-continent collision;  deformation;  strain; Taiwan; Coastal Range,,Journal of the Geological Society of China,4,40,scopus,NATIONAL CHENG KUNG UNIVERSITY;UNITED GEOTECHNOLOGY INC.,DEPARTMENT OF EARTH SCIENCES,X
1997.0,J. Geol. Soc. China,Discussion on the genetics and the correlation of river terraces in Taiwan,Sung Q;Lu M;Tsai H;Liew P,"The study on the correlation among eight major river terrace groups was based on the morphological dating method to verify Tomita's correlation scheme (1937). Generally speaking, the Lateritic Terrace (LT) surfaces developed before 30,000 years ago, while the Fluvial Terrace (FT) surfaces have formed within 30,000 B.P.. Tomita's correlation scheme of river terraces may be plausible on the regional scale but not on those in the Chao-chou Fan Terraces, which have younger and low-elevated LT surfaces. The relative height and the presence of lateritic soil on the coverage of river terraces could not have played a major role in the correlation scheme. The time period and the conditions for lateritization in Taiwan remain to be studied. The main factors affecting the development of river terraces also include tectonism, eustatic change and climatic changes. Local tectonic activity plays a principal role in the evolvement of the relative height and the number of levels of river terraces. The dissection of most LT(I) surfaces can be attributed to the decrease in the global sealevel around 30,000 B.P.. As a result, climatic change has caused the formation of the FT surfaces in different regions of Taiwan since the last glacial in spite of drastic eustatic changes. Above all, the complex responses of a river system to tectonism, eustasy and climate have controlled the timing of the formation of river terraces in different regions.","Department of Earth Sciences, National Chen-Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; Department of Geography, Natl.

1997.0,J. Geol. Soc. China,Feasibility study of the thermoluminescence dating method on late Pleistocene coastal sediments southwestern Taiwan,Chen Y;Lo C;Wu W;Liu T,"Four Thermoluminscence (TL) ages younger than 50 ka have been determined for the coatal sediments collected from southwestern Taiwan. These TL ages indicate a constant overestimation when compared to the corresponding radiocarbon ages. This is supposedly the result of the sediments not totally being bleached. However, the TL method is still feasible in determining the age of the sediments if the deviation can be eliminated. Based on the experience here, repeated extraction and 80°C 2N HCl treatment are able to center the size fraction and get rid of some clay minerals, thereby really improving the precision of this method. In addition, the samples with low temperature peak dominated were further annealed for 5 minutes at 230°C to enhance the high temperature signal, when the glow curves were read. In other words, the resolution in the high temperature region, used to determine the TL age, can be obviously raised by this modification. Through this modified method, four reasonable TL ages were derived. The linear regression line of An65 is different from the others, that show the exponential regression lines. This is because An65 has a 375° peak (on the basis of a heating rate of 5°C/sec). This implies that the 375°C peak has a high capacity for TL signal accumulation and is appropriate in being applied for older age determination.","Department of Geology, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,4,1.0,,"Department of Geology, , Taipei, Taiwan",,NA NA,,,Article,coastal sediment;  Pleistocene;  thermoluminescence dating; Taiwan,,Journal of the Geological Society of China,1,40,scopus,NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY,NOTREPORTED,X
1997.0,J. Geol. Soc. China,Investigation of the Tungshing debris flow hazard in Hualien,Lin M;Chang K,"During the period of Typhoon Tim, a hazardous debris flow occurred on July 10, 1994 in Tungshing village, Hualien. This debris flow was triggered by heavy rainfall with peak intensity of 104 mm/ hr. Various methods of site investigations, including aerial photograph interpretation, geological and topographic reconnaissance as well as field and laboratory tests, were carried out to obtain the geometric and kinematic characteristics of the debris flow. The aerial photos taken prior and subsequent to the hazard were transformed into large scale topographic maps and were applied for the analysis of topographic changes in gully beds and hill slopes. It was determined that the debris flow emanated from a rockslide near the crest of a hill, moved down a gully channel and later extended and deposited part of the debris material in the village on its way out to sea. The drainage area of the gully was around 80 hectares, and the length of the gully was about 1,400 meters. The average gradient of the gully was about 16°. Grain size distributions of the debris material were determined from field tests, and it was found that the debris consisted of more than 60% fine particles, and thus the debris flow was classified as mudflow. The total decreased volume of the debris material was estimated at approximately 310,000 m3. From the superelevation data obtained from the geomorphological features, the flow velocity and flow rate were estimated to be 9∼10 m/s and 950 m3/s, respectively. The estimated high flow rate and uncommonly long time lag together with the topographic features indicated that the debris flow may have been dammed or plugged one or several times during the flow process.","Institute of Applied Geology, National Central University, Chungli, Taiwan",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,,"Lin, M.-L.; Institute of Applied Geology, , Chungli, Taiwan",,NA NA,Debris flow;  Mud flow,,Article,debris flow;  flow rate;  rainfall; Taiwan; Hualien,,Journal of the Geological Society of China,4,40,scopus,NATIONAL CENTRAL UNIVERSITY,INSTITUTE OF APPLIED GEOLOGY,X
1997.0,J. Geol. Soc. China,Leadzinc quartz veins of the Chinmienshan Toucheng northeastern Taiwan,Chu H;Wang Y;Yu B,"Sulphide quartz veins were discovered unexpectedly during the excavation of a prospective tunnel in the construction of the Taipei-Ilan Expressway. The principal metallic minerals in the veins are galena, sphalerite, wurtzite, pyrite, chalcopyrite and pyrrhotite. Detailed petrographic observations indicate that this lead-zinc vein is closely associated with quartz, calcite and chlorite. Flourite veins are also present. Fluid inclusions in quartz veins demonstrate an evolving H2O-CO2-NaCl-CH4-N2 system. During the experiments, coexisting threephase (aqueous liquid+CO2-liquid+vapor) fluid inclusions with different CO2 contents, homogenized between 310° and 330°C, were trapped during the fluid unmixing of a homogeneous aqueous CO2-bearing hydrothermal fluid. Aqueous two-phase (liquid+vapor) inclusions normally homogenize between 220° and 260°C, which accounts for the successive loss Of CO2, CH4 and N2 during fluid vaporization. This coincides with increasing salinity and decreasing temperatures resulting from high enthalpy steam loss. High angle faults are related to regional strike-slip and extension tectonics. The geotectonic background of this hydrothermal leadzinc quartz veins is very similar to the nearly Chinkuashih gold-copper deposits 25 km north-northeastward. The occurrence of the lead zinc quartz veins is probably related to an underneath deep-seated andesitic and /or granitic igneous body.","Central Geological Survey, MOEA, Taipei, Taiwan",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,,"Chu, H.-T.; Central Geological Survey, , Taipei, Taiwan",,NA NA,Fluid inclusions;  Galena;  Homogenization temperature;  Salinities;  Sphalerite,,Article,fluid inclusion;  homogenization temperature;  lead;  mineralization;  mineralizing fluid;  salinity;  zinc; Taiwan; Toucheng,,Journal of the Geological Society of China,3,40,scopus,,NOTREPORTED,X
1997.0,J. Geol. Soc. China,Lithofacies analyses of the arcrelated sequence in the Coastal Range eastern Taiwan,Chen W,"Late Cenozoic deposits in the Coastal Range of eastern Taiwan can generally be divided into a lower arc-related sequence and an upper collision-related one. The former, which the present study aims at, can be further subdivided into the Tuluanshan Formation and Kangkou Limestone. These consist of lavas, pyroclastic breccias, tuffs (lapilli tuffs), epiclastic sandstone/conglomerate and limestone. The author reconstructs the lithofacies association and distribution of these deposits in eight sections which exhibit sequential and lateral facies variations in submarine-volcano environments. The sequential facies can be divided in ascending order into lavas, pyroclastic breccias, epiclastics and limestone. The lavas were probably formed under a deep-water environment below the volatile fragmentation depth, whereas the pyroclastic breccias were likely formed above that depth. As the volcanic calderas built up to shallow water above the air-weather wave base, large amounts of epiclastics began to deposit on volcano aprons, and organisms perched around volcano in shallow water. Based on detailed lithological study, lateral lithofacies around the volcanoes can be distinguished into proximal and distal apron facies. The proximal apron facies consists of clast-/matrix-supported pyro-/epiclastics, welded tuff, fallout ash, cross-stratification epiclastics and in-situ limestone. The distal apron facies consists of pillow/sheet lavas, matrix-supported pyroclastic breccias and conglomerates, rhythmic tuffaceous turbidites, slumped beds and carbonate blocks. In general, the pyroclastics show progressively fining and thinning deepward away from the eruption centers. They were deposited in submarine environments, forming a nonchannelized fan-delta system around the volcano aprons.","Department of Geology, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,1,1.0,,"Department of Geology, , Taipei, Taiwan",,NA NA,,,Article,limestone;  submarine volcano;  volcanic arc;  volcaniclastics; Taiwan; Coastal Range,,Journal of the Geological Society of China,8,40,scopus,NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY,NOTREPORTED,X

1997.0,J. Geol. Soc. China,Mesoscopic structures developed in the Lichi melange during the arccontinent collision in the Taiwan region,Chen W,"In eastern Taiwan, the Lichi Melange forms a chaotic mudstone belt with well-developed scaley foliation. After detailed field investigations on the mesoscopic structures, it is suggested that those structures have developed during the processes of arc-continent underplating and collision between the Eurasian and Philippine Sea plates. The lichi Melange is mainly composed of mudstone with inclusions of sandstone and ophiolitic blocks with varying degrees of fracturing. The mudstone matrix was pervasively sheared resulting in scaly foliation with small slickensided surfaces and striations. The rake of the striations is within the sense of a left-lateral movement. Besides, the sandstone blocks in the foliated matrix are pervasively fractured, and their long axes are generally parallel to the striations of the scaly foliation in the mudstone matrix. The matrix and blocks have apparently suffered from the same stress field. These structures may have occurred collectively in a strong shearing zone during the collision. Three types of fractures, namely, hybrid, extension (crack) and cataclastic shear (web structure) fractures, can be identified in the sandstone blocks. The extension crack in some blocks is well cemented with calcite and is oblique at a high angle to the bedding. These extension fractures are commonly accompanied by normal faulting. In light of the research of deep-sea core, it is suggested that the crack in the sandstone represents an intensive hydrofracture that occurred in the coherent strata beneath or above the shear zone in the accretionary planes in sandstone that are characterized by broken and less than average grain size relative to the surrounding rocks. The web and crack structures commonly observed in sandstone blocks within the melange that exhibit some degree of lithification and healing. The fact that the extension fracture and web structures cross cut by the hybrid fracture and scaly foliation indicates that it formed before the collision. It is suggested that these structures reflect tectonic deformation and stratigraphic disruption during the unerplating process. Thus, based on the mesoscopic structures, the structural styles of the Lichi Melange is best described as a tectonic melange rather than a sedimentary melange or olistostrome.","Department of Geology, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,1,1.0,,"Department of Geology, , Taipei, Taiwan",,NA NA,,,Article,Taiwan; arc-continent collision;  melange;  structural geology; Taiwan,,Journal of the Geological Society of China,15,40,scopus,NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY,NOTREPORTED,X
1997.0,J. Geol. Soc. China,Mineralogy and geochemistry of granitic rocks from Chinmen Liehyu and Dadan Islands Fujian,Lan C;Chung S;Mertzman S,"The granitic rocks from Chinmen, Liehyu and Dadan, three offshore islands of Fujian, were emplaced in 139.4±0.4 Ma and 100.9± Ma, corresponding to the first and third episodes, respectively, of late Yanshanian magmatism in SE China. These rocks consist predominantly of granite, with subordinate quartz monzonite, granodiorite, trondhjemite and tonalite compositions. Mineralogically, they contain various proportions of quartz, K-feldspar (Or87-97), plagioclase (An11-40), biotite, muscovite and calcic amphibole (ferro-pargasite to ferro=hornblende). Most granitic rocks are peraluminous (A/CNK&gt;1.0 and normative corundum&gt;1%) and display moderately fractionated LREE patterns with negative Eu anomalies, despite the fact that HREE enrichment and LREE depletion are occasionally observed. In the primitive mantle-normalized trace-element diagram, they show a significant Nb depletion similar to those of magmatic rocks from subduction zones. In addition, they plot in the volcanic arc field on the discrimination diagram of Pearce et al. (1984). Overall, these granitic rocks exhibit high-K calc-alkaline to shoshonitic geochemical signatures as commonly observed in I-type granites. However, they usually contain biotites with some compositions similar to A-type granites and are crosscut by abundant late Cretaceous mafic dikes. Combining geologic information from the coastal region of Fujian, late Cretaceous granitic rocks form the offshore islands of Fujian are suggested to represent products from a post-orogenic tectonic environment in the SE China continental margin. Their arc-like geochemical features are interpreted to have been inherited from protoliths formed during previous subduction-related proceses. These rocks are considered genetically different fom the late Cretaceous granitic rocks in east-central Taiwan which likely resulted from a convergent-margin setting.","Institute of Earth Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Geology, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Geosciences, Franklin and Marshall College, Lancaster, PA, United States",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;USA,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,,"Institute of Earth Sciences, , Taipei, Taiwan",,NA NA,,,Article,geochemistry;  granite;  magmatism; China,,Journal of the Geological Society of China,8,40,scopus,INSTITUTE OF EARTH SCIENCES;NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY;FRANKLIN AND MARSHALL COLLEGE,INSTITUTE OF EARTH SCIENCES,X
1997.0,J. Geol. Soc. China,Pn velocity and moho depth in Taiwan,Ma K;Song D,"The Pn velocity and Moho depth variation beneath Taiwan are investigated by the observation of Pn phases recorded by the Central Weather Bureau Seismographic Network from 1991 to 1995. For the region belongs to continental crust, we chose the earthquakes with depth less than 20 km. The stations with epicentral distance greater than 150 km were used in this analysis. Polarization analysis and three component ratio were adopted to identify the Pn phase. Comparison between observation and calculation based on planelayered model give us the evidences of Pn velocity and Moho depth derived from this study. Preliminary results show that Pn velocity in Central Range (CR) is about 8.52 km/sec which is about 5∼8 % higher than other two provinces, which are 7.79 km/sec for Western Plain (WP) and 8.04 km/sec for Western Foothills (WF), respectively. The Moho depths are about 31 km, 34.5 km and 43 km, respectively, for WP, WF and CR.

1997.0,J. Geol. Soc. China,Pollen anlaysis of middle Last Glacial buried valley sediments in the Shanchia area northern Taiwan,Tseng M;Liew P,"Pollen analysis was carried out with an attempt to understand the late Pleistocene climatic condition of the lower reach of the Tahanhsi River, northern Taiwan. The samples were collected in a buried valley located at Shanchia, where a section of fluvial deposits of 470cm in thickness is exposed due to modern river erosion. According to a previous study, this section was formed between 52ka and 31ka, belonging to the middle Last Glacial period. Our result demonstrates that the herbaceous pollen elements are predominant, especially of Cyperaceae and Gramineae. based on dominant percentage, four pollen zones, ie THa, THb, THc and THd, have been distinguished in the younging order. Zone THa is dominated by Gramineae - Cyperaceae - Pinus - Alnus - Cyclobalanopsis/Quercus - Taxodiaceae. It is worthy to note that among the woody elements we found dominant Pinaceae pollen in consistence with the occurrence of the same tree trunk fossils. This implies that the climate was dry and cool at that time. During the time period of Zone THb, the climate was warmer than Zone THa so that its pollen assemblage is characterized by Cyclobalanopsis/Quercus - Gramineae - Cyperaceae - Taxodiaceae - Pinus - Alnus - Castanopsis. Castanopsis here reaches its maximum pollen percentage value in the study section. This means that a little warm period has occurred during the middle Last Glacial period. Zone THc was formed in a drier but less warmer climate than Zone THb, represented by a dominant assemblage of Cyperaceae - Gramineae - Cyclobalanopsis/Quercus - Taxodiaceae - Pinus - Alnus - Castanopsis. The youngest zone - THd is dominated by Cyclobalanopsis/Quercus - Cyperaceae - Gramineae - Taxodiaceae - Liquidambar - Castanopsis - Alnus, representing a warmer climate than in Zone THc but was less warmer than in Zone THb. Based on our analysis, sthe herbaceous elements were important around the lowland area of northern Taiwan during the middle Last Glacial period. As a conclusion, in 50ka the study area was in a dry and cool climate condition. An intermediate interstadial stage occurred around 37ka, and thereafter the climate turned to a dry condition but with occasional rush rain.","Earth Science Department, Taiwan Museum, Taipei, Taiwan; Institute of Geology, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,,"Earth Science Department, , Taipei, Taiwan",,NA NA,,,Article,palaeoclimate;  Pleistocene;  pollen analysis;  pollen analytis; Taiwan,,Journal of the Geological Society of China,2,40,scopus,EARTH SCIENCE DEPARTMENT;NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY,EARTH SCIENCE DEPARTMENT,X
1997.0,J. Geol. Soc. China,Preliminary study on the late quaternary climatic environment of the Taipei Basin and its possible relation to basin sediments,Liew P;Huang C;Tseng M,"Deposition in the Taipei Basin was primarily determined by paleoclimate and neotectonic activity. The palynological study of three long cores in the western part of the Taipei Basin shows the occurrence of at least 3 warm-cold climatic cycles (PwIII-PcIII); PwII-PcII and PwI-PcI) since the middle Pleistocene and the overlying Holocene deposits. In the earliest Cycle III (PwIII-PcIII), the studied area of the Taipei Basin was a lake under warm, humid climatic conditions (PwIII), as indicated by the pollen assemblage with a high frequency of Castanopsis and spores. Follwing this, laminated lake sediments with a subalpine forest in PcIII probably represents the coldest climate during the deposition of the Taipei Basin. In climatic Cycle II (PwII-PcII), the earlier warm-dry climate (PwII) is recognizable by the high frequency of Castanopsis accompanied by some elements associated with drought such as Pinus and herbs. Marine incursion occurred in part of the basin at least, as indicated by the low diversity of benthic foraminifers in the Panchiao Core. The later cold-dry climate of Cycle II (PcII) is characterized by herb-dominant assemblages in the fluvial-lake deposits. The warm climate (PwI) of Cycle I correlates with the last interglacial and is distinguished by periods of high temperature and heavy precipitation alternating with less warm and less wet interludes. The last glaciation (PcI) is relatively less cold and less drier compared with previous glacials, except for the dry phase of the LGM. If the three cycles represents the main interglacial-glacial cycles since middle Pleistocene, the earliest age of the basin sediments would be in between 0.3 to 0.4 Ma. The interstadial moist of the last glacial stage might be related to the deposition of thick, large-sized conglomerates in the basin. The Holocene (Hw) is manifested by the relatively higher percentage of Castanopsis. The earliest Holocene has organic-rich layers suggestive of a relatively warm, wet climate. Holocene transgression is clearly recorded in the estuarine deposits of the sequence.","Institute of Geology, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,,"Liew, P.-M.; Institute of Geology, , Taipei, Taiwan",,NA NA,Glacial;  Interglacial;  Pleistocene;  Pollen analysis;  Taipei Basin,,Article,Quaternary climate; Taiwan; Taipei Basin,,Journal of the Geological Society of China,10,40,scopus,NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY,INSTITUTE OF GEOLOGY,X

At one location, the expressway was at a distance of about 100 m from a syncline axis. Shortly after construction, signs of instability were first observed at the road embankment and at the adjacent natural rock slope. Results of back-analyses indicated that the actual shear strength which was mobilized along the failure plane in mudstones had an angle of shearing resistance of 9.6 degrees. This agreed with the residual strength obtained by direct shear testing on a slickensided sample.

1997.0,J. Geol. Soc. China,Sequence stratigraphy of the Middle to Upper Miocene strata northern Taiwan a preliminary study,Yu N,"In order to better understand the sea-level fluctuations of the middle to upper Miocene strata in northern Taiwan, sequence stratigraphic analysis is applied to three stratigraphic sections, namely the North Coast, Chenfu and Chuhuangkeng. The chronostratigraphic framework of these 'wave- and tide-dominated shoreline' siliclastic strata can be established by integrating the available micropalaeontologic data. In these sections, parasequences can be divided into facies successions of 5-20m thick. Each parasequence is bounded by marine flooding surfaces which are characterized by intensive bioturbation, shelly lags, or erosion surfaces. Sequence boundaries can be identified by the sharp-based, shoreface sandstones overlying offshore interbeds, and by the top of upward-shoaling facies successions from 'subtidal sandstones' to 'intertidal interbeds' which are associated with mud cracks, rootlets or paleosols. These features represent the abrupt basinward shifting in facies characteristics and unconformities which display the large-scale falls of relative sealevel. Ten, eight and 10 sequences are divided by sequence boundaries in the three studied sections respectively. Three sequence types are recognized by different facies succession. In shelf or coastal sequences, parasequences can be stacked in the aggradational-progradation, retrogradation and progradation successions which represnt lowstand, transgressive and highstand systems tracts, respectively. A complete, large-scale transgression-regression cycle of relative sea-level is displayed by the sequence boundary and systems tracts in each sequence. However, the parasequences in the coastal sequences, which directly overlie shelf deposits, can only be stacked in the aggradation and progradation succession which represent transgressive and highstand systems tracts. An incomplete, large-scale transgression-regression cycle of relative sea-level is implied by the missing of lowstand systems tracts. Constrained by the chronostratigraphic framework, the sequences of three sections appear to be mutually consistent. The sequence stratigraphy of the middle to upper Miocene is established and provides a new scheme of nine correlatable units. Furthermore, the derived relative sea-level changes of the studied sections fluctuate with the 3rd-order eustatic curves on the Vail's chart with only two discrepancies around 15.5 and 13.8 Ma. Consequently, it is inferred that sedimentation of the middle to upper Miocene was dominated by eustacy in northern Taiwan.","Institute of Geology, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,1,1.0,,"Institute of Geology, , Taipei, Taiwan",,NA NA,,,Article,Miocene;  sequence stratigraphy; Taiwan,,Journal of the Geological Society of China,5,40,scopus,NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY,INSTITUTE OF GEOLOGY,X
1997.0,J. Geol. Soc. China,Structural evolution in the Hsüehshan range Taiwan,Lu C;Chu H;Lee J,"Contraction, transcurrent faulting, block rotation and even extension are four essential tectonic mechanisms involved in the progressive deformation of arcuate collision belts. The neotectonic evolution of the Taiwan Mountain Belt is mainly controlled by the oblique convergence between the Eurasian plate and the Philippine Sea plate as well as the corner shape of the plate boundary. Based on field observations and tectonic analysis, and taking geophysical data and experimental modelling into account, the authors interpret the curved belt of the Hsüehshan Range in terms of contractional deformation (with compression, thrust-sheet stacking, folding, back-thrusting and transcurrent faulting) combined with increasing block rotation, bookshelf-type strike-slip faulting and extension. As a consequence, the formation of the Hsüehshan Range, the division of conjugate strike-slip faulted domains and the variable nature and distribution of paleostresses should not be interpreted in terms of distinct Plio-Quaternary episodes but rather should reflect a single, albeit complicated, regional pattern of deformation. Pop-up structures are widely distributed within the Hsüehshan Range. Because of the high uplift and erosion rate, these pop-up structures can be studied in detail using geometrical, kinematic, and paleostress analyses. This paper attempts to describe the general characteristics of the pop-up structures and their influence on the structural patterns of the Hsüehshan Range.","Institute of Geology, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan; Central Geological Survey, Taipei, Taiwan; Institute of Earth Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,,"Lu, C.-Y.; Institute of Geology, , Taipei, Taiwan",,NA NA,Hsüehshan Range;  Pop-up structures;  Structural evolution,,Article,collision zone;  orogenesis;  pop up structure;  tectonic evolution; Taiwan; Hsuehshan Range,,Journal of the Geological Society of China,5,40,scopus,NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY;INSTITUTE OF EARTH SCIENCES,INSTITUTE OF GEOLOGY,X
1997.0,J. Geol. Soc. China,Sulfidebearing quartz veins in the Szeleng sandstone Chinmienshan northeastern Taiwan a preliminary study on fluid inclusions and stable isotopes,Yui T;Chu H;Wang Y;Yeh T,"Sphalerite-galena-pyrite-calcite-quartz veins in the Szeleng Sandstone were found in the Chinmienshan area, a northeastern Taiwan. The abundance of the sulfide minerals in some of these veins may indicate the presence of a hidden Pb-Zn deposit. Fluid inclusions in the quartz veins can be divided into five types. Types I to IV fluid inclusions contain variable amounts of H2,O, CO2 and dissolved salts and may be genetically related to the fluids responsible for the sulfide formation. Variable CO2 content, as well as the correlations between total homogenization temperature and salinity/CO2 content of these fluids inclusions (except those Type III inclusions with total homogenization temperature lower than 210°C) suggest that the responsible fluids could be cogenetic through fluid boiling (fluid immiscibility). On the other hand, the lack of unambiguous prove for the coexistence of fluid-rich and vapor-rich inclusions with appropriate compositions and similar total homogenization temperatures also suggests that the fluids may have different origins. Type V inclusions are empty due to decrepitation, which may have resulted from decompression/heating during sulfide formation. The highest formation temperature of these sulfides would not have been lower than 300°C and the highest pressure, not lower than 0.43 kbar. Thesse sulfides are most probably genetically related to a concealed igneous intrusion. Their sulfur isotopic compositions range from +3.2 to +6.9‰, implying that either these sulfides have multipe sulfur sources or some reactions have effectively fractionated heavy sulfur during igneous evolution and/or sulfide formation. δ18O values of quartz and calcite indicate that the oxygen isotopic compositions of the responsible fluids were mainly buffered by the rocks. The origin(s) of these fluids, therefore, cannot be discerned based on the available data.","Institute of Earth Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan; Central Geological Survey, MOEA, Taipei, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,4,1.0,,"Institute of Earth Sciences, , Taipei, Taiwan",,NA NA,,,Article,fluid inclusion;  quartz vein;  sulphide; Taiwan,,Journal of the Geological Society of China,1,40,scopus,INSTITUTE OF EARTH SCIENCES,INSTITUTE OF EARTH SCIENCES,X

The 14C dates of samples representing ancient coastlines were used to estimate the tectonic subsidence/uplift rates. The area has been found to have had high average subsidence rates of up to 3 mm/yr and, accordingly, high sediment accumulation rates of up to 8 mm/yr for the last 12 Ka. On the other hand, the Hopi area has had a minimum average uplift rate of 1.5 mm/yr for the last 50 Ka. The pattern of comparatively long-term crustal movement as demonstrated by the 14C dating results from the Zeikang-Hopi area is fundamentally consistent with that shown by previous short-term geodetic triangulation.

1997.0,J. Geol. Soc. China,The fractures and paleostress of deformed pebbles in the conglomerates of the Toukoshan formation ChiayiYunlin area,Lin C;Huang M,"Field observations show that the Toukoshan Formation in the Chiayi-Yunlin area has been deformed becoming an open, gentle fold. Although systematic fractures have not been identified in terms of the whole conglomerates, extension fractures, shear fractures and contact marks are observed in the pebbles of the conglomerates of the Toukoshan Formation. It is recognized that (1) the degree of cementation, (2) degree of clastic support, and (3) the locations of structural position represent three important factors in controlling the deformation of the pebbles of the conglomerates. Most pebbles with these fractures are found in areas adjacent to faults and in places where conglomerates are more clastic-supported and poorly cemented. Extension fractures and contact marks are frequently observed in places farther away from faults, whereas shear fractures are dominant only in outcrops adjacent to faults. The direction of the maximum principal stress σ1 inferred from extension fractures in deformed pebbles is nearly horizontal and trends 100° to 145° in azimuth. The σ3 trends NE-SW, and its plunge varies from horizontal to vertical. This indicates that the magnitudes of σ2 and σ3 are close to each other, and that they may be interchangeable.","Department of Earth Sciences, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,,"Lin, C.-W.; Department of Earth Sciences, , Tainan, Taiwan",,NA NA,Conglomerate;  Paleostress analysis;  Pebble deformation;  Toukoshan Formation,,Article,conglomerate;  deformation;  fracture;  palaeostress;  pebble;  structural analysis; Taiwan; Chiayi-Yunlin,,Journal of the Geological Society of China,4,40,scopus,NATIONAL CHENG KUNG UNIVERSITY,DEPARTMENT OF EARTH SCIENCES,X

These zones correspond to the subduction Philippine Sea Plate in northern Taiwan and to that in southeastern Taiwan.

Several image profiles along various latitudes show that the Eurasian Plate starts to subduct at longitude 120.8°E at a depth of 40km. The tectonic activity to the south of 22.9°N and to the north of 23.5°N is mainly dominated by the subducting slabs, while within the range, it is mainly dominated by the active collision of the two plates.","Institute of Geophysics, National Central University, Chung-Li, Taiwan",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,,"Institute of Geophysics, , Chung-Li, Taiwan",,NA NA,,,Article,seismic tomography;  subduction slab; Taiwan; Philippine Sea,,Journal of the Geological Society of China,5,40,scopus,NATIONAL CENTRAL UNIVERSITY,INSTITUTE OF GEOPHYSICS,X

Two statistical analyses are performed to evaluate their impact on precipitation, which is determined by averaging the records from eight weather stations in Taiwan from 1897 to 1993. One analysis utilizes the so-called El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon as a co-factor, while the other does not. It is very note-worthy that both analyses show a statistically significant drought effect on this local region's precipitation as brought on by such sulfur-rich volcanic activities.

1997.0,J. Geol. Soc. China,The mechanism of shallow landslides on the argillaceous rock slopes,Fan C,"Shallow landslides are one of the most common types of mass movement that widely occur on argillaceous rock slopes. The thickness of the removed body generally ranges from a few centimeters to less than one meter. Those larger than one meter are very rare. The results of such frequent mass movements include the significant loss of human property, destruction of communications and the reduction of agricultural land. Some parts of Taiwan and the Barbados stand as typical examples of sites which have significantly suffered from frequent shallow landslides. To solve this problem, it was necessary to examine the failure mechanism of these to determine whether a possible solution could be found. The pervasive scaly fabric with polished surfaces and random orientations is the most distinctive characteristic of this kind of argillaceous rock, known as scaly clay. The formation of the scaly texture is usually associated with a high level of stress during its compacting history. It has been found that these scaly fabrics play a very important role in controlling the mechanical behaviour of the scaly clay. The present study employed state-of-the-art laboratory procedures to characterize the physical properties of the studied material. The mechanical behaviour was investigated using standard consolidated-undrained triaxial tests. The results of the experimental study reveal that the scaly texture is the essential part of the failure mechanism. The fabric changed as the material approached the ground surface which was a result of the combination of weathering and surface erosion. The resulting landscape is the widespread, unvegitated, steeply sloped terrain which forms such famous badlands.","Explor. and Devmt. Res.

The mylonite zone, resulting from ductile deformation related to the mountain building in Taiwan, is about 6 meters wide and consists abundantly of fine-grained biotites. Biotite separates from nine samples of the sheared gneiss body yield well-defined plateau dates ranging from 4.1 to 3.0 Ma. Whereas petrographic and microstructural observations reveal that grain size of the biotites decreases as degree of the ductile deformation increases, no apparent co-variation exists between the age data and the above two parameters. Therefore, the biotite dates represent neither the cooling nor resetting ages of the gneiss body, and are considered to indicate the timing of the mylonitization which lasted for over 1 m.y.. Thus, the hinterland of the Taiwan Mountain Belt might have experienced an extensive internal deformation during 4.1-3.0 Ma, and hence has been unlikely a rigid body throughout the mountain building processes. These age data enable us to better constrain the nature and timing of the kinematic evolution of the Taiwan Mountain Belt created by the arc-continent collision.","Department of Geology, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,,"Wang, P.-L.; Department of Geology, , Taipei, Taiwan",,NA NA,40Ar/39Ar dating;  Mylonitization;  Tanano Schist,,Article,arc-continent collision;  argon-argon dating;  gneiss;  mylonitization;  schist; Taiwan,,Journal of the Geological Society of China,14,41,scopus,NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY,NOTREPORTED,X

The purposes of this study are to investigate the melting properties of the basaltic magma; to study the crystallization sequence of the phenocrysts; and to estimate the differentiation trend of the magma. The basalt was collected at Charnsoushan of the Sanshia area, Taipei County. It is blackish-gray, fine grained and vesicular. Phenocrysts include olivine, plagioclase, and augite. The rock powder was loaded into a platinum envelope and suspended in a 1-atm vertical-quenching furnace for heating in the air. It was quenched into water after each run. The experimental temperature ranged from 1320°C to 1059°C with the duration time from five to thirty-nine hours. Run products were made as polished sections. Phases were first identified with reflected-light microscopy. Compositions of glasses were analyzed with an electron microprobe. Experimental results showed that the liquidus temperature of the basaltic magma was located at 1274°C and the solidus temperature was estimated to be close to 1059°C. The melting interval is about 215°C. The liquidus minerals are iron-titanium oxides. The following phases to crystallize are plagioclase at about 1187°C; clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene at about 1168°C. The evolution of the basaltic magma shows that the chemical trends are as follows: enrichment in SiO2 and K2O; depletion in total FeO; little variation in the early and middle stage and decrease in the late stage for MgO and CaO; little increase in the early stage and decrease for Al2O3.

China,Biomarkers in the peat deposit of the Toushe Basin central Taiwan,Oung J;Hu A;Shiea J;Liew P,"Peat samples from the Toushe Basin have been analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) for biomarkers. The analysis shows presence of n-alkanes, diterpanes, triterpanes and their unsaturated counterparts. The n-C22--n-C35 alkane series, with a predominance of C27, C29 and C31, is ubiquitous in all samples, suggesting that the peat is mainly composed of organic matter of terrestrial higher plants. Presence of n-C17 and n-C19 alkanes in the samples at depths of 10-13, 18-20 and 27-37m indicates contribution from phytoplankton or algae to the samples, and may therefore imply an aqueous depositional environment. Occurrence of tetracyclic triterpenoids and diterpenoids indicates contribution of terrestrial higher plants of angiosperms and gymnosperms, respectively. Tetracyclic triterpanes are much more dominant than diterpenoids, suggesting that angiosperms are the major source of organic matters for the peat. Presence of Podocarpaceae family of gymnosperms is confirmed based on the ubiquity and dominance of isopimarane and phyllocladane in the samples. Both tetracyclic triterpenoid and diterpenoid distributions show variations with depth, indicating a vegetational change of angiosperms and gymnosperms.

1998.0,J. Geol. Soc. China,Depositional environment and correlation of Quaternary stream terraces in the Liwuchi Valley Tailuko National Park,Liu C,"Stream terraces are widespread in the Liwuchi and their atltitudes are various from one another. Several of them contain very thick gravel deposits. For the purpose of their correlation, sedimentological analysis was successfully applied. From the lithofacies analysis, their depositional processes include fluvial, sediment gravity and hyperconcentration flows, and the resultant products may correspond to braided river, dam and landslide deposits, respectively. Three sedimentation stages can be distinguished. The first stage was dominated by fluvial flow which produced very thick gravel of more than 160m; the second stage, by a dam deposit, even thicker than the first one and its age is 2400 ± 40 yr BP. The third one was also characterized by a dam deposit. At least four times of channel change were recorded in the Liwuchi. In the lower reach, we observed erosional type terraces that are formed by sudden increase of stream erosion caused by partial collapse of dams.","Natl.

China,Determination of governing equations of groundwater flow and solute transport from the hydrogeologic conceptual model,Jean J,"The hydrogeologic conceptual model can be applied to delineate the groundwater flow conditions, characteristics, and hydrogeologic conditions and to determine the governing equations of groundwater flow and solute transport and boundary conditions, thus forming the basis of numerical field simulations of the above-mentioned parameters. Furthermore, the model can be used to verify the modeling results, and the more complete the model becomes, the more reliable and accurate the results of numerical modeling and the determination of hydrogeologic parameters (i.e., transmissivity and storage coefficient). The purpose of this study is to determine the governing equations of groundwater flow and solute transport as shown by a numerical model on the basis of the hydrogeologic conceptual model, which can be built in the following three steps: (1) defining hydrogeologic (hydrostratigraphic) units; (2) defining the groundwater flow system; and (3) preparing a water budget.

1998.0,J. Geol. Soc. China,Evolution of the Southern Longitudinal Trough in the incipient Taiwan arccontinent collision zone and its tectonic implication,Fuh S;Liu C,"The Southern Longitudinal Trough (SLT) is a N-S trending elongated trough located just east of the Hengchun in the incipient arc-continent collision zone of offshore southern Taiwan. Detailed seismic sequence analyses and structural interpretation of seismic reflection profiles reveal that the development of SLT probably involved the following three phases: (1) initial formation of a local depression or pull-apart basin on a structural high of a backthrust wedge; (2) the transformation of the local depression into a N-S trending elongated basin as two parallel marginal faults of the basin drew near; and (3) clockwise rotation of the depocenter axes as the Luzon Arc made the same rotation. Three possibilities are suggested for the initiation of the trough: (1) a pull-apart basin bounded by two juxtaposing strike-slip faults; (2) a horsetail-splay structure developed at the southern end of the Longitudinal Valley Fault; and (3) a basin formed due to collapse of a frontal backthrust wedge. Based on the sequential development of SLT, structural patterns and paleomagnetic data, an evolutionary model is proposed to illustrate how the N-S trending accretionary wedge-forearc basin-volcanic arc system evolves into the NNE trending en echelon structural configuration of the onland Coastal Range. After the initial formation of SLT between the two marginal faults, the Luzon Arc rotated clockwise as they moved into the incipient collision zone. The Longitudinal Valley Fault then extended offshore along the western margin of SLT. In future, if the arc-continent collision proceeds, most of the present SLT would be converted into another Longitudinal Valley bounded by two high-angle thrusts, and the rotated Luzon Arc with the NE segmented blocks and the Taitung Trough would become a new Coastal Range with en echelon structures.","Explor. and Devmt.

1998.0,J. Geol. Soc. China,Geodynamic implications of presentday kinematics in the southern Ryukyus,Lallemand S;Liu C,"Both newly acquired GPS and structural data in the southern Ryukyu subduction zone allowed us to point out some first-order geodynamic implications of the present-day kinematics. Off Hualien, the Hoping Basin lies on a wide zone undergoing north-south transform motion and associated extension between NE Taiwan and the Yonaguni Island. Indeed, this westernmost segment of the Ryukyu Arc, which includes the Yonaguni Island, is moving southward 1.4 cm/yr faster than NE Taiwan with respect to South China. The basin could thus have developped as a pull-apart basin controlled by en-echelon N-S-trending right-lateral strike-slip faults and associated N40°E-trending normal faults during the last 2 m.y., based on present divergence rate. A N50°W-striking valley cutting the southern Ryukyu Arc slope between Yonaguni and Hateruma Islands is explained as a graben caused by the still ongoing differential motion between Yonaguni and Hateruma Ryukyu Arc segments, during the last 400,000 years. If we extrapolate back the present-day kinematics, about half of the southernmost Okinawa Trough might have been formed during the last 2 m.y. The convergence rate between the southern Ryukyu Arc and the Philippine Sea Plate has been estimated to be about 10.5 cm/yr in a direction of N312°east of 123°30'E, and N325°west of 123°30'E. The convergence obliquity is thus estimated to be about 40°and 53°, with respect to the N275°striking Ryukyu Trench, west and east of 123°30'E, respectively. The convergence obliquity increases to 60°west of 122°40'E, because of the northward turn of the trench close to Taiwan. The Ryukyu accretionary wedge (Yaeyama Ridge) can undergo about 3 to 5 cm/yr of transcurrent motion toward Taiwan assuming a mean degree of partitioning of 0.5.","UMR CNRS-UM2 5573, Lab.

1998.0,J. Geol. Soc. China,Magnetic analysis on lacustrine deposits of YuanYang Lake northern Taiwan,Lee T;Lin H;Liew P,"This study presents the results about the magnetic properties of two lacustrine sediment cores (£YYL2 and £YYL6) sampled from Yuan-Yang Lake in northern Taiwan and discusses their environmental implications. More than 300 specimens from these two cores were analyzed. Results of 14C dating indicate that the calibrated age at the bottom of the core £YYL2 is about 4000 cal.B.P. and that of the core £YYL6 is about 4500 cal.B.P. Both of them seem quite reasonable when we compare the paleomagnetic secular variation patterns of the studied cores with those of marine and lake sediments from Japan compiled by Hyodo et al (1993). They further enable us to estimate the sedimentation rate of Yuan-Yang Lake as about 1 mm/yr. Different variation patterns of magnetic susceptibility of the two studied cores have been found. Core £YYL2 ashows relatively higher value than that of core £YYL6. This phenomenon is thought to be mainly due to the geographic conditions of the coring sites and to the magnetic mineral contained. Site £YYL6 is located closer to the lake flank but farther away from the source of clastic sediments than site £YYL2. Furthermore, the former is in a shallower water depth with weaker inflow force than the latter. With less clastic debris and more organic materials, therefore, core £YYL6 naturally has weaker magnetic susceptibility signals. Actually, samples with more organic materials are apt to be dominated by ilmenite instead of magnetite as their major magnetic carrier. Several high peaks of magnetic susceptibility appear in the layers of core £YYL2 dominated by green-gray sediments instead of organic materials. It is related to the fact that these layers contain much more magnetic minerals. Most of the sediments of these layers are considered to come from surrounding rock formations during dry periods. Assuming a constant sedimentation rate of about 1 mm/yr in the studied area, four major dry periods are found at about 3300, 2800, 2000 and 800 yr B.P. In addition, frequency-dependent low field magnetic susceptibility analysis indiactes that it is generally very low for core £YYL2, suggesting that it is devoid of very fine-grain magnetic minerals.","Institute of Earth Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Geology, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan; United Geoteck, Inc., Taipei, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,,"Institute of Earth Sciences, , Taipei, Taiwan",,NA NA,,,Article,lake sediment;  magnetic susceptibility;  palaeoenvironment;  Quaternary; Taiwan; Yuan-Yang Lake,,Journal of the Geological Society of China,3,41,scopus,INSTITUTE OF EARTH SCIENCES;NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY,INSTITUTE OF EARTH SCIENCES,X

China,Management and remedial measures of a dipslope excavationa case study,Wang W;Lin Y;Hsieh H,"More attention has been paid on dip-slope cutting and engineering after the recent Lincoln County hazard in the hilly suburb of Taipei City, Taiwan. This paper presents a case history of design, construction and remedial measures of a near-vertical 13.8m open-cut slope at Nei-Hu district of northeastern Taipei City. The bedrock of the job site is sandstone and shale interbeds of the Miocene Shihti Formation, which has a dip-slope at the northern side of the site. Some passive retaining structures including micropiles, rock bolts and shotcretes were originally designed to protect the open-cut face during excavation instead of heavy retaining ones. Instruments including inclinometers, rebar strain gauges etc. were installed for the monitoring purpose and back analysis. At the last two stages of excavation, weathered clay seams between the interbeds were unexpectedly exposed and the rock slope slid before ample insertion of rock bolts. An emergency action was taken to prevent further movement of the slope, and reassessment was made to remedy the nearly failed cut slope. The paper also describes some details of feedback analysis of rock bolts and wedge blocks.","Department of Geology, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan; Trinity Found. Eng. Consult.

1998.0,J. Geol. Soc. China,Meteoric diagenesis and stable isotopic compositions of the Hengchun limestone southern Taiwan,Gong S;Yui T,"The Pleistocene Hengchun Limestone of the Kueitzechiao-Oluanpi area was deposited during the Quaternary eustatic sea-level fluctuations and the ongoing Penglai Orogeny. Previous studies have established a N-S facies-geometry profile and proposed a depositional history of the Limestone. The Hengchun Limestone in the Kueitzechiao-Oluanpi area was interpreted to have developed during two major glacioeustatic sea-level cycles. It was suggested that the limestone on the Oluanpi terrace, in particular, developed during the younger cycle. To study subsurface lithofacies and diagenesis of the Hengchun Limestone, three boreholes were drilled on the Oluanpi terrace. Petrographic and stable isotopic studies of the core samples have identified: 1) predominant meteoroic diagenesis texture, 2) strong meteoric influences on stable carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions, and 3) two subaerial exposure surfaces that define three depositional cycles. The results are consistent with the glacioeustatic interpretation for the origin of the Hengchun Limestone. The present study, however, further reveals that the Limestone of the Oluanpi terrace may have formed during three minor glacio-eustatic cycles.","National Museum of Natural Science, Taichung, Taiwan; Institute of Earth Science, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,,"National Museum of Natural Science, Taichung, Taiwan",,NA NA,,,Article,glacioeustasy;  meteoric diagenesis;  Quaternary;  stable isotope; Taiwan,,Journal of the Geological Society of China,1,41,scopus,NATIONAL MUSEUM OF NATURAL SCIENCE;INSTITUTE OF EARTH SCIENCE,NATIONAL MUSEUM OF NATURAL SCIENCE,X
1998.0,J. Geol. Soc. China,Morphology and origin of the Shoushan submarine canyon off southwestern Taiwan,Yu H;Huang E,"Detailed morphology and configuration of the Shoushan Canyon on the upper slope off southwest Taiwan are described using newly acquired bathymetric data and seismic profiles. The canyon extends from the upper slope southwestward to a water depth of 1,700 m where it merges into the larger Penghu Canyon to the west. Two tributary canyons enter into the Shoushan Canyon from the west at water depths shallower than 1,500 m. The canyon shows high relief, steep walls (about 8 degrees) and V-shaped cross sections, which are typical in canyon morphology. The canyon floor increases its depth from 394 m to 1,748 m, stretches for a length of about 50 km and has an averaged width of 4.4 km. The Shoushan Canyon not only can be considered a single submarine canyon but also a tributary canyon that joins into the larger Penghu Canyon to the west. Morphologic and seismic characteristics suggest that the canyon may have a composite origin (e.g., controls of erosion and structure). Vigorous submarine down-cutting along the structurally weak zone is considered as the main cause to form the Shoushan Canyon, which is characterized by a relatively straight course on the Kaoping Slope.","Institute of Oceanography, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,,"Yu, H.-S.; Institute of Oceanography, , Taipei, Taiwan",,NA NA,Morphology;  Origin;  Shoushan Canyon;  Submarine canyon,,Article,downcutting;  morphology;  structural geology;  submarine canyon; South China Sea,,Journal of the Geological Society of China,10,41,scopus,NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY,INSTITUTE OF OCEANOGRAPHY,X
1998.0,J. Geol. Soc. China,Recent geologic structures in the Chipenchushan area southern Taiwan,Chen C,"Chipenchushan is located in the southern part of the Central Range metamorphic belt of Taiwan, which has been uplifted and exhumed since Pliocene due to collision between the Asian continental margin and the Luzon volcanic arc. This particular site is censidered important and crucial for observing recent structures due to the collision because the complicated huge anticlinorium of the Central Range has the general plunge to the south and thus the metamorphic basement has been just unroofed relatively intact. Basically, according to the scale and style of the structures, recent structural activities in this area can be generally divided into three consecutive stages, namely (1) 1st stage: west-verging thrusting and concomitant folding as a consequence of a push from E to W, (2) 2nd stage: east-verging backthrusting and concomitant folding and (3) 3rd stage: mainly folding due to a near N-S compression. These activities and structural phenomena clearly represe-nt the products of an area undergoing general compression, resulted from the oblique arc-continent collision driven by the northwest push of the Philippine Sea plate. The aforementioned structural activities are believed to have taken place at a rather shallow level and at a relatively young age, reflecting quite faithfully different interactions of various stress with geologic material through time. The mountain-building process of this area in total, can be regarded as mainly represented by piling up of the thrust and backthrust sheets, with folding playing a relatively minor and concomitant role. The orogenic model of this area may be comparable to that of the Moine Thrust zone of Scotland described by Knipe (1990).","Departemnt of Earth Sciences, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,1,1.0,,"Chen, C.-C.; Departemnt of Earth Sciences, , Tainan, Taiwan",,NA NA,Backthrust;  Chipenchushan;  Orogeny;  Piling up;  Thrust,,Article,anticline;  arc-continent collision;  fold and thrust belt;  metamorphism; Taiwan,,Journal of the Geological Society of China,0,41,scopus,NATIONAL CHENG KUNG UNIVERSITY,DEPARTEMNT OF EARTH SCIENCES,X
1998.0,J. Geol. Soc. China,Scarp evolution of fan terraces along the Lanyang River Taiwan,Sung Q;Tsai H;Fu J;Chyi S;Lee P,"An evolutionary model of scarp slopes has been constructed for the Lanyang River area of northeastern Taiwan. In this area, younger terraces have higher free-face height/scarp height ratios than older terraces, while the latter have higher debris-slope height/scarp height ratios than the former. The time necessary for a slope to evolve from the free-face to the debris-slope stage is estimated to be less than 1,000 years for the Mimodan fan and the Fubur fan. When a scarp slope forms, its debris-slope angle initially increases exponentially, and then flattens when the debris slope takes over the entire slope. On the other hands, its free-face angle decreases exponentially and then approaches a constant. The slope evolution observed here is close to the non-parallel retreat model. A general slope evolution model can be applied to terrace scarps of subtropical Taiwan as well as scarps in arid western American, in spite of climatic differences. Vegetation cover and weathering conditions on the scarps, however, may vary because of different climatic conditions. These different conditions can result in different rates of degradation and different repose angles. The angles of repose measured in the Lanyang River area for scarps without free-faces may be as large as 45°in contrast to those ranging from 33°to 38°proposed by previous works. The result may improve the resolution of morphological dating in river terraces.","Department of Earth Sciences, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, 701, Taiwan; Department of Geography, Changhua University of Education, Changhua, 500, Taiwan; Department of Geography, Kaohsiung Normal University, Kaohsiung, 802, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,5,1.0,,"Sung, Q.; Department of Earth sciences, , Tainan, 701, Taiwan",,NA NA,Evolutionary model;  Morphological dating;  Terrace scarp,,Article,dating method;  fluvial process;  landform evolution;  slope dynamics;  terrace; Taiwan,,Journal of the Geological Society of China,1,41,scopus,NATIONAL CHENG KUNG UNIVERSITY;CHANGHUA UNIVERSITY OF EDUCATION;KAOHSIUNG NORMAL UNIVERSITY,DEPARTMENT OF EARTH SCIENCES,X

1998.0,J. Geol. Soc. China,Tectonic implications of an aseismic belt beneath the Eastern Central Range of Taiwan Crustal subduction and exhumation,Lin C,"This study proposes a tectonic model of crustal subduction and exhumation to explain the phenomena of an aseismic belt beneath the Eastern Central Range of Taiwan. The aseismic belt, generally parallel to the strongly convergent boundary between the Eurasian and Philippine Sea plates in Taiwan, is very unusual because it is in sharp contrast to the very seismically active neighboring areas. In order to understand the tectonic implications of this aseismic belt, the author first reviews a variety of geophysical and geological evidence including seismic tomography, fault plane solutions, heat flow, crustal deformation, strain, uplift and erosion rates, geomorphology and results of isotopic studies. The tectonic history in the Taiwan region suggests that the continental margin of the Eurasian plate has been slightly subducted beneath the Philippine Sea plate. The light continental crust of the former was dragged downward by its dense mantle lithosphere. In the meantime the buoyancy forces of the subducted continental crust built up with depth. Eventually, the exhumation occurred when the buoyancy forces increased enough to produce decoupling at the base of the crust and then failure in front of the subduction zone. This model can be used to account for the absence of seismicity beneath the Eastern Central Range due to higher temperature within the exhumed material, which is considered generally consistent with most of the geophysical and geological evidence reviewed in this paper.","Institute of Earth Sciences, Academia Sinica, P.

To estimate the source parameters, the ground motion at twelve stations located in the range of 5 to 18 km from the epicenter were selected for study. With a circular crack model assumed, this earthquake was moving at a constant velocity along the radical direction. A spatial dependence slip-time function was used to synthesize ground displacement in the near-source distances. The agreement of the observed waveforms and the computed seismograms yielded an average dislocation of 74 cm over the circular fault with a radius of 2.0 km. The seismic moment was estimated to be 2.8 X 1024 dyne-cm, and the rupture velocity was 2.0 km/sec. The average rise time was 0.5 sec, while the stress drop was 153 bars. This stress drop corresponds to a strain drop of about 5 X 10-4.","Institute of Earth Sciences, Academia Sinica, P.O.

Isotopic and chemical studies in this paper, show some genetic characteristics of basaltic rocks of NTVZ bearing an evidently intraplate basalt-like (ocean island basalt-like) and a minor arc signature (high field strength elements depletion). These results do not support a previous concept that NTVZ belongs to the western extension of the Quarternary Ryukyu Volcanic Front (QRVF). The geographic location of the southern Okinawa Trough further indicates that NTVZ is simply not continuous with QRVF. The submarine topography and some rock dating results also suggest that NTVZ and QRVF are two independent volcanic belts at the western Pacific rim. An alternative model may be that the major source of NTVZ seems to have derived from products of asthenosphere upwelling under a lithospheric extensional environment after the arc-continent collision in northern Taiwan and relevant offshore area.","Institute of Earth Sciences, Academia Sinica, P.O.Box 1-55, Taipei, Taiwan; Institute of Geology, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Geosciences, Franklin and Marshall College, Lancaster, PA 17604, United States",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;USA,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,4,1.0,,"Chen, C.-H.; Institute of Earth Sciences, P.O.

1999.0,J. Geol. Soc. China,Calcite twins for determining paleostrain and paleostress in the thrust front of the Taiwan collisional belt,Hung J;Kuo C,"Our paleostrain and paleostress studies based on computer calculation and inversion of calcite twin data from limestone formations in the frontal portion of the western Taiwan fold-thrust belt demonstrate that twinning in calcite records complex recent and present-day strain and stress fields in the foreland of the active Taiwan mountain belt. The strain magnitude of calcite twins is typically less than 6%, decreasing southward in response to the southward-decreasing age of the limestones. High negative expected values indicate that the reefal limestones in the Tainan, Kaohsiung and Hengchun regions exhibit a monophase, inhomogeneous strain. The maximum shortening direction in the country rocks is characteristically layer-parallel and regional transport-parallel, whereas two orthogonal directions of the maximum shortening in the veins reflect, on the one hand, the regional compression where tilting occurred (non-layer-parallel), and, on the other, local extension due to bending of limestones at thrust ramps or fold hinges. The stress regimes reconstructed from the calcite petrofabric are predominantly compressional, reflecting the main stage of neotectonic evolution of the collision zone. The stress tensors computed from Miocene-Pleistocene limestones reveal an association of NW-SE and E-W compressional trends, as a result of dispersion of the main N130°E compression in complex folded-faulted blocks of western Taiwan. The inferred directions of compression are closely related to the recent kinematics of the Philippine Sea plate relative to Eurasia.","Institute of Geophysics, National Central University, Chungli, Taiwan; Institute of Applied Geology, National Central University, Chungli, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,,"Hung, J.-H.; Institute of Geophysics, , Chungli, Taiwan",,NA NA,Calcite twin;  Limestone;  Paleostrain;  Paleostress,,Article,calcite;  crystallography;  deformation;  limestone;  strain;  stress;  twinning; Taiwan,,Journal of the Geological Society of China,3,42,scopus,NATIONAL CENTRAL UNIVERSITY;NATIONAL CENTRAL UNIVERSITY,INSTITUTE OF GEOPHYSICS,X
1999.0,J. Geol. Soc. China,Evolution of river terraces along the LanYang River northeastern Taiwan A river response to base level change,Sung Q;Fu J;Chyi S;Tsai H,"During the last 2000 years, several alluvial fans were formed along the upper reach of the Lan-Yang River, northeastern Taiwan. They were subsequently undercut into different levels of river terraces. Slope profiles of the river terraces were measured in the field to study the evolution of the terrace scarps. River terraces can be chronologically correlated by morphological dating according to the proposed diffusion equation model and scarp retreat model. Evolution of the longitudinal profiles of the Lan-Yang River and its tributaries was reconstructed based on the correlation scheme of the river terraces. The model of evolution suggests that changes in the local base level of erosion play an important role in the formation of the river terraces. The local base level elevation changed as a result of alluvial fan deposition, rather than tectonic uplift or climatic changes.","Department of Earth Sciences, National Cheng-Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; Department of Geography, National Kaohsiung Normal University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Department of Geography, Natl.

1999.0,J. Geol. Soc. China,Existence of the Chuochi transverse fault reconfirmed in southeastern Taiwan and its tectonic implication,Lin M,"One of the major issues between the two editions of the Geologic Map of Taiwan is whether the Chuochi Transverse Fault (CTF) exists in the Tananao Schist terrain. Through the present detailed geologic mapping, CTF has been verified by the abrupt discontinuity of a 500 m thick spotted pelitic schist, a key bed in the Yuli Belt. Besides, the Fault can also be recognized from a straight lineament on an air-photo. The vertical CTF strikes roughly NW-SE in the present study area. From the stratal distribution, especially of the spotted pelitic schist, we estimate that (1) its horizontal displacement is mainly left-lateral; (2) its northeastern block moved up relative to its southwestern one; (3) its strike separation along CTF is at least 7 km; (4) its vertical separation is about 3.5 km; and (5) its range of the net slip is presumably about 2.5~4.5 km. The considerably large vertical component of the net slip estimation based on the presence of geologic discontinuities implies that CTF might have moved left-laterally prior to Eocene, and then was re-activated during the Plio-Pleistocene Penglai Orogeny forming the present geologic configuration. Besides, the scope and sense of CTF movements are at large consistent with the movements of the Philippine Sea Plate against the Asia Plate and subsequent exhumation of the Central Range since Plio-Pleistocene time. CTF represents one way of expression of the collision kinematics, the contemporaneous extension structures in the course of compression.","Department of Earth Science, National Taiwan Normal University, Taipei, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,1,1.0,,"Lin, M.-L.; Department of Earth Science, , Taipei, Taiwan",,NA NA,Geologic Map of Taiwan;  Synorogenic extension;  Tananao Schist;  Transverse fault;  Yuli Belt,,Article,collision zone;  fault;  fault displacement;  kinematics;  orogeny;  tectonic setting; Taiwan,,Journal of the Geological Society of China,0,42,scopus,NATIONAL TAIWAN NORMAL UNIVERSITY,DEPARTMENT OF EARTH SCIENCE,X
1999.0,J. Geol. Soc. China,Fault tectonics of the Coastal Range eastern Taiwan,Lin C;Liu Y;Lai W;Cheng W,"The Coastal Range in eastern Taiwan is an exotic terrane along the Asian Continental Margin. It was formed by an oblique collision between the Luzon volcanic arc of the Philippine Sea plate and the Asian continent. Substantial fault-slip data were collected from 195 stations in the Range for determining the type and amount of structural deformation. Inversion of fault-slip data shows that σ1 is nearly horizontal with the azimuth ranging between 90°-150°; the median σ1 plot has a trend of 127°. This is consistent with the results derived from the present-day plate motion. However, through detailed investigation, different stress states can be differentiated. They were correlated with different evolutional stages of deformation of the Range. The extensional events recorded in the Tuluanshan Formation probably represent the deformation during subduction or at an early stage during collision. The first compressional event with σ1 of about 140°represents deformation during the collision stage. The second compressional event with σ1 of about 120°represents deformation during the accretion stage, after the volcanic arc rotated 20°-40°clockwise.","Department of Earth Sciences, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; Disaster Prevention Research Center, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; Lu Hsing High School, Pintung, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,4,1.0,,"Lin, C.-W.; Department of Earth Sciences, , Tainan, Taiwan",,NA NA,Arc-continent collision;  Coastal Range;  Deformation;  Fault-slip analysis,,Article,deformation;  fault slip;  faulting;  structural geology;  tectonics; Taiwan,,Journal of the Geological Society of China,2,42,scopus,NATIONAL CHENG KUNG UNIVERSITY;NATIONAL CHENG KUNG UNIVERSITY;LU HSING HIGH SCHOOL,DEPARTMENT OF EARTH SCIENCES,X
1999.0,J. Geol. Soc. China,Investigation of a fault zone in urban environments by shallow reflected and reflectedconverted waves,Jeng Y;Chen K;Wang J,"Shallow seismic surveys using reflected and reflected-converted waves were carried out in an area underlain by several presently unmapped faults in the northwestern district of Taipei metropolis. We used three-component geophones of 4.5 Hz natural frequency to record P, P-SV, and S-wave reflection data which were 50 m, 42 m and 40 m profiles, respectively. Field-recording parameters were planned according to the restricted space of the urban area. Our data processing demonstrates the advantages of employing filtering techniques in multifold sequences to attenuate complex urban noise. Three seismic profiles of reflected and reflected-converted waves recorded along the same survey line show different lateral and vertical resolutions. Reflection events on the northwest side of our S-wave profile differ in reflection character and frequency from those on the southeast side at the same time interval. Diffraction patterns in the raw S-wave data, together with variations in the velocity structure of S- and P-SV-wave data, suggest that the Chin-Shan fault may extend southwest to the Kuan-Tu plain of the Taipei Basin. The fault that we imaged could be an antithetic fault associated with the master Chin-Shan fault. The fault plane dips about 50°to 55°toward the southeast.","Department of Earth Sciences, National Taiwan Normal University, 88, Sec.4, Ting-Chow Road, Taipei, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,,"Jeng, Y.; Department of Earth Sciences, 88, Sec.4, Ting-Chow Road, Taipei, Taiwan",,NA NA,Fault;  P-SV-converted wave;  S-wave;  Shallow reflections,,Article,fault zone;  seismic survey;  urban area; Taiwan,,Journal of the Geological Society of China,0,42,scopus,NATIONAL TAIWAN NORMAL UNIVERSITY,DEPARTMENT OF EARTH SCIENCES,X

Within an identifiable depth of nearly 400 m, high-resolution seismic profiles show that the shallow strata here are all horizontal, concordant with the surface topography. The strata remain virtually undisturbed since their deposition. Carbon 14 ages show that the shallow sediments are of late Quaternary. It has been reported that the late Cenozoic arc-continent collision not only induced Penglai Orogeny in the Central Range and the Western Foothills but also the new Taiwan Orogeny along the Taiwan Strait coastline.

1999.0,J. Geol. Soc. China,Lithostratigraphy and structural geology of the Wanjung area eastern Taiwan and their tectonic implications,Lin M,"The rock sequence exposed in the Wanjung area, eastern Taiwan, belonging to the Yuli belt of the Tananao Schist, is mainly composed of serpentinite, spotted pelitic schist, quartz-mica schist, mica schist and greenschist. The present field investigation, geologic mapping and structural analysis have revealed that the only one litho-stratigraphic unit, the Yuli Formation, can be subdivided into the Mataian, Shenjung, Changhanshan and Wanjung Members in ascending order. The former three Members are considered here as the autochthonous (in-situ) Yuli Formation, while the last one as allochthonous. The Mataian Member is constituted by alternation of quartz-mica schist and mica schist. The Shenjung Member is mainly composed of spotted pelitic schist, a good key bed in the field. This Member seems to occur as a tongue-like strata and pinches out to the west. The Changhanshan Member is composed of a thick quartz-mica schist with greenschist. The Wanjung Member mainly composed of metamorphosed ophilolitic rocks and bounded by the Wanjung thrust, occurs as a klippe overlying the other Members. Three sets of axial-plane cleavage (S1, S2 and S3) were developed during three stages of deformation. S1 strikes northeast and dips about 50°to the northwest. S2 strikes east-west and dips nearly vertical. S3, however, strikes northeast and dips about 20°toward the northwest. On the whole, the enveloping surface of folds of the strata striking roughly east-west and dipping gently towards the north, shows a simple homoclinal structure. The original depositional structures of the rocks were largely obliterated after the multiple deformations. The general disposition of the rocks was largely preserved from the very beginning of the multiple deformations and then slightly modified in the later deformations. Faults identified in the area are named as the Peichanghanshan normal fault and the Wanjung thrust. Structural events in the study area, from early to late, are the three-stage regional deformation/metamorphism, followed by the Peichanghanshan normal faulting and the Wanjung thrusting. Based on the data mentioned above, some important geotectonic implications of the Yuli belt have been summarized as follows: (1) The southeastward vergence of the cleavage formed by the first-stage regional deformation/metamorphism may be considered as resulted from the subduction of the Kula plate toward the northwest under the Eurasia continent in the late Mesozoic Nanao orogeny. The second-stage deformation occurred in the Taiping or in the early Penglai orogeny, which has been accompanied by a retro-grade metamorphism. The third-stage regional deformation represented by the Peichanghanshan normal faulting and the Wanjung thrusting is evidently products of the late Penglai orogeny. (2) Probably during 0.65~0.37 Ma, the Wanjung Member was transported westward to the current site along the Wanjung thrust. (3) The Mataian, Shenjung and Changhanshan Members in the present area can be correlated respectively to the Hongyeh, Juisui and Hutoushan Members in the Juisui area, based on the marker bed of the spotted pelitic schist.","Department of Earth Science, National Taiwan Normal University, Taipei, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,1,1.0,,"Lin, M.-L.; Department of Earth Science, , Taipei, Taiwan",,NA NA,Litho-stratigraphy;  Structural geology;  Tananao Schist;  Yuli belt,,Article,deformation;  lithostratigraphy;  structural geology;  tectonics; Taiwan,,Journal of the Geological Society of China,7,42,scopus,NATIONAL TAIWAN NORMAL UNIVERSITY,DEPARTMENT OF EARTH SCIENCE,X
1999.0,J. Geol. Soc. China,Magnetobiostratigraphy of the Sanfuchi section in the Coastal Range of eastern Taiwan A new result,Horng C;Shea K;Lee J,"In this study we present a new result of magnetobiostratigraphy of the Takangkou Formation in the Sanfu-chi section of the Coastal Range. Paleomagnetic analysis from 51 sites indicates that the mudstone and the turbidite sequences, belonging to the lower and middle part of the Takangkou Formation, have four and two magnetic polarity records, respectively. As Globorotalia truncatulinoides appeared in the lower part of the turbidite sequence and Gephyrocapsa oceanica did not occur in the section, the two (normal and reversed) polarities in the turbidite sequence are assigned to the early stage of Chron C2n (= the lower part of Olduvai Subchronozone, ca. 1.86-1.95 Ma) and Chron C2r.1r (1.95-ca. 2.11 Ma), respectively. However, for the four (reversed-normal-reversed-normal) magnetic polarities in the mudstone sequence, there are two possibilities in their correlation to the geomagnetic polarity time scale, depending on the interpretation for the occurrence of nannofossil Discoasters. If Discoasters are indigenous, the four polarities are assigned to the middle stage of Chron C2An (= the middle part of Gauss Chronozone, 3.04-3.35 Ma) because they are located above the first appearance datum of Gt. tosaensis and below the last appearance datums of D. pentaradiatus and D. surculus. In this case, a one-million-year hiatus (ca. 2.11-3.04 Ma) may exist between the boundary of the mudstone and turbidite sequences. On the other hand, if Discoasters are regarded as reworked fossils, the uppermost reversed polarity in the mudstone sequence should still belong to Chron C2r.1r as the lower part of the turbidite sequence and the three lowest magnetic polarities are correlated to Chron C2r. 1n (= the Reunion Subchronozone, 2.11-2.27 Ma).","Institute of Earth Sciences, Academia Sinica, P.

China,Modeling the interstrata seepage effect near the Nanhua Reservoir Taiwan,Wu M;Shih K,"A numerical groundwater flow modeling program, MODFLOW, was applied to simulate inter-strata seepage near the flooded region of the Nanhua Reservoir. It was concluded that groundwater seeping within the strata mainly flowed from northeast to southwest. The water loss rates caused by the seepage after the presumed operation of the reservoir were estimated. Relatively high hydraulic gradients, due to the seepage effect, were located near the villages of Yusun and Maopu. The greatest changes in water loss rate were found to correspond to the water level changes in the Hojuey River. The time required for the seepage effect to reach a steady state condition, based on different presumed settings for specific storage, was also estimated. The Chutouchi Formation may affect the seepage flow more within the studied region during the early phase of the simulation. However, during the later phase, the Maopu shale may have more effect. It was concluded that the numerical modeling technique is capable of predicting the effect of inter-strata seepage. It can also help us obtain a further understanding of the hydrogeological characteristics of the region.","Department of Earth Sciences, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,,"Wu, M.-C.; Department of Earth Sciences, , Tainan, Taiwan",,NA NA,Inter-strata seepage;  Numerical modeling;  Reservoir,,Article,hydrogeology;  modeling;  reservoir;  seepage; Taiwan,,Journal of the Geological Society of China,0,42,scopus,NATIONAL CHENG KUNG UNIVERSITY,DEPARTMENT OF EARTH SCIENCES,X
1999.0,J. Geol. Soc. China,Petrogenesis of the Chilung Volcano Group andesites in northern Taiwan Mixing with shallow sediments and amphibolerich nodules in the andesitic melts,Chen C,"Pleistocene igneous rocks in the Chilung Volcano Group (CVG) mainly distribute in five larger geographic units including Chilungshan, Wutanshan, Penshan, Tsaoshan and Chimuling (1.4-0.9 Ma), and one smaller unit in the Chilungtao (0.3 Ma). They are characterized by having highly reacted amphiboles, slightly resorbed micas, Ca-rich plagioclases, euhedral magnetites, and large corroded and rounded quartz grains as phenocrysts. Chemical compositions for 28 rock samples are rather uniform, with SiO2 contents varying from 55.5 to 58.5 wt%. In general, these rocks can be regarded as medium-K calc-alkaline andesites in an orogenic belt, with some slightly pronylitized rocks high in K (K2O=3.5-3.7 wt%), Li (45 ppm), Rb (230 ppm) and Ba (930-960 ppm). Sr and Nd-isotope ratios of CVG andesites suggest that incorporation of an enriched component, most probably the upper crustal materials, is necessary. Petrogenetically, amphibole, mica, plagioclase and magnetite are considered to be the disintegrated member of the captured amphibole-rich nodules, i.e., the cumulates for earlier magmatism, in the melts. Large quartz grains, on the other hand, may represent the xenocrysts originated from the underlying shallow sediments, most probably the Wuchihshan Sandstone Formation. It is estimated that CVG andesites caught ~15% of such nodules and were contaminated with 5~12% of such sediments during the ascend of magmas. Due to low SiO2 contents and irrelevance of quartz crystallization in the course of magmatic differentiation, the old usage of 'dacite' for denoting these igneous rocks should better be abandoned.","Department of Geology, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,1,1.0,,"Chen, C.-H.; Department of Geology, , Taipei, Taiwan",,NA NA,Amphibole-rich nodules;  CVG andesites;  Petrogenesis;  Sediments,,Article,andesite;  petrogenesis;  volcanism; Taiwan,,Journal of the Geological Society of China,6,42,scopus,NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY,NOTREPORTED,X
1999.0,J. Geol. Soc. China,Stableisotope studies of amphibolite in the Tungao area northeastern Taiwan,Yui T,"Stable-isotope studies were carried out for the amphibolites of the Tananao Metamorphic Complex in the Tungao area, northeastern Taiwan to understand their possible water-rock interaction history. The δ18O values of the amphibolites range from +2.8 to +5.2‰, which are lower than those of the normal basaltic rocks (i.e., δ18O = +5.7 ± 0.3‰). The low-18O compositions most probably resulted from high-temperature seawater-rock interaction before the protoliths were accreted to the continental margin. The δ18O values of the amphibole separates range from +2.0 to +4.0‰, whereas those of the coexisting plagioclasses from +3.6 to +7.7‰. The steep slope of the data array in the δ-δ plot demonstrates that the two minerals were not in isotopic equilibrium, which is thought as a result of differential retrograde isotope exchange between amphibole/plagioclase and the ambient metamorphic fluid after the amphibolite facies metamophism. The low δ18O values also indicate that the amphibolites would be relatively impermeable to metamorphic fluid or that water/rock ratios in the amphibolites were low during the amphibolite facies metamorphism. The amphibolite xenoliths in the nearby Yuantoushan granitic intrusive have high δ18O values, i.e., +9.1 to +10.4‰. They obviously have isotopically exchanged with or have been assimilated by the granitic rocks. The δ18O values of vein quartz in the amphibolites range from +6.5 to +12.8‰. Based on isotopic fractionation between coexisting quartz and rutile, those quartz with low δ18O values (i.e., &lt; +7.7‰) might have been formed under retrograde temperatures of 505°- 549°C, while those with high δ18O values (i.e., &gt; +10.0‰) might have been formed at lower temperatures or related genetically to the nearby granitic intrusives.","Institute of Earth Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,1,1.0,,"Yui, T.-F.; Institute of Earth Sciences, , Taipei, Taiwan",,NA NA,Amphibolite;  Stable isotope;  Taiwan,,Article,amphibolite;  geochemistry;  isotopic composition; Taiwan,,Journal of the Geological Society of China,2,42,scopus,INSTITUTE OF EARTH SCIENCES,INSTITUTE OF EARTH SCIENCES,X
2000.0,J. Geol. Soc. China,Characteristics of the Tatun volcanic eruptions North Taiwan Implications for a cauldron formation and volcanic evolution,Song S;Tsao S;Lo H,"The Tatun Volcano Group (TVG), built up mainly during the last 0.8 to 0.2 Ma, is the most voluminous volcanics in northern Taiwan. It is composed of about twenty volcanic composites, cones and domes. The volcanic edifices, except Nantzeshan, Tinghouhsiushan and Patotzeshan volcanoes, can be divided into two groups based on the spatial distribution, one along the' Chinshan Fault and the other along an east-northeast to northeast trend to the east of Chinshan Fault. They intersect at the Tatunshan Volcano forming a half amphitheater with a mouth opening to the north-northeast. The volcanic rocks occur as lava flows, pyroclastic breccias, surges tuffs, lahars and reworked volcaniclastics. Lava flows with minor pyroclastic flows, surges and fallout tuffs represent the main lithofacies. Similar occurrence of the volcanic rocks can be also found in the subsurface. TVG is represented by effusive or silent rather than explosive eruption based on its low explosive index (tephra/tephra+lava). Numerous lava flows poured out almost at the same time. High gravity anomalies and strong hydrothermal alteration areas are dominantly located inside the amphitheater. The Tatun volcanic eruptions are characterized mainly by formation of a cauldron at the turning of the regional stress from compression to tension in northern Taiwan.","Department of Geology, National Taiwan Univ., Taipei, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,,"Song, S.-R.; Department of Geology, , Taipei, Taiwan",,NA NA,Cauldron;  Lithofacies;  Tatun volcano group;  Volcanism,,Article,lithofacies;  volcanic eruption; Taiwan,,Journal of the Geological Society of China,39,43,scopus,NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIV.,NOTREPORTED,X
2000.0,J. Geol. Soc. China,Distribution and significance of volcanic materials in sediments of the Taipei basin,Chen C;Lin S,"Volcanic materials are sporadically distributed in sediments of the Taipei Basin as known from twelve geological wells drilled for the past nine years, including gravels and blocks of volcanic rocks and sandy grains of volcanogenic minerals. Gravels are mainly granules and pebbles in conglomeratic beds or layers in the Chingmei Fm and the lower member of the Hsinchuang Fm, and are stream deposits controlled by three major rivers that merge into this Basin. Source regions may include the Chilung Volcano Group (CVG), Huangtsuishan of the Tatun Volcano Group (TVG) and Miocene terrain in northern Taiwan that have been emplaced with alkali basaltic and microsyenitic rocks. Blocks are thick chaotic mixture of various lithic types of andesites originated from TVG, and can be recognized as lahar deposits. Discrete mineral grains of volcanic origin sometimes can be found to occupy up to 15% or more in the sand fraction of few particular thin layers. Concentrates of such minerals can be grouped into four major assemblages: plagioclase + hypersthene + hornblende, plagioclase + hypersthene + augite + hornblende (+ magnetite), plagioclase + hypersthene (+ augite), and hornblende + magnetite. Except the last one that may represent the detrital materials of CVG, they are thought to be the derivatives of TVG. Moreover, the assemblage of plagioclase + hypersthene + hornblende is found in the bottom of the Sungshan Fm in three wells out of four that are close to TVG. As these volcaniclastics are also associated with abundant montmorilloniterich clays, or the main alteration product of fine-grained volcanic glasses, in the matrix, it is therefore suggested that they are probably volcanic ashes. Accordingly, there could have happened an event of volcanic activity in TVG approximatly at the early depositional time of the Sungshan Fm (ca. 10 Ka), and TVG could thus be regarded as dormant at present.","Department of Geology, National Taiwan University, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,,"Chen, C.-H.; Department of Geology, Taiwan",,NA NA,Lahar deposit;  Taipei Basin;  Tatun volcano group;  Volcanic ashes,,Article,lahar;  sedimentary basin;  volcanic rock; Taiwan,,Journal of the Geological Society of China,5,43,scopus,NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY,NOTREPORTED,X
2000.0,J. Geol. Soc. China,Field occurence 40 Ar39 Ar Daring and petrochemical features of volcanic rocks in Mienhuayu off ne Taiwan,Wang K;Chen C;Chung S;Lin L;Lo C;Yang T;Lee H,"Mienhuayu, a volcanic islet off the NE Taiwan, is located in the central part of the Northern Taiwan Volcanic Zone (NTVZ). In this study, we first conducted a detailed field investigation which reveals that the islet is composed dominantly of subaerial mafic lava flows and scoria deposits. 40 Ar/39 Ar dating on a whole-rock sample from a lava flow indicates that the volcanic activity started as early as 2.6 Ma, in good accordance with the time proposed for the onset of extensional collapse of the northern Taiwan mountain belt. Volcanic rocks from the Mienhuayu are generally hypocrystalline, showing porphyritic texture with high-Mg olivine (Fo ≈ 80∼81), bronzite (En ≈79 ∼82) and labradorite (An ≈ 58∼66) as major phenocryst phases in a glassy matrix. They are uniform in the whole-rock composition marked by apparently higher magnesium (i,e., MgO ≈ 5.9∼8.1 wt.%, Mg-value ≈ 56∼62) relative to silica contents (SiO2 ≈ 52.7∼54.5 wt.%), a feature that may be observed in either silica-saturated melts from the intraplate extension environment or high andesites commonly from the fore-arc settings. In the incompatible element variation diagram, although the Mienhuayu volcanic rocks exhibit moderate enrichments in the large ion lithophile and light rare earth elements and lead, they do not display depletions in the high field strength elements as other NTVZ volcanic rocks. The Mienhuayu volcanic rocks, moreover, show geochemical affinites to the Miocene (∼23-9 Ma) intraplate tholeiitic basalts from NW Taiwan and contemporaneous (∼13 Ma), extension-related high-Mg andesites from the Iriomote-jima, southern Ryukyu. We therefore suggest that, in comparison to other NTVZ volcanics whose generation requires a subduction-modified, lithospheric mantle source, the Mienhuayu magmas originated from an ascenced asthenospheric mantle which had been subtly affected by adjacent Ryukyu subduction zone processes. This asthenosphere upwelling could have been achieved in the beginning of post-collisional lithospheric extension in the northern Taiwan mountain belt during Plio-Pleistocene time.","Department of Geology, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,7,1.0,,"Wang, K.-L.; Department of Geology, , Taipei, Taiwan",,NA NA,Mienhuayu; Northern Taiwan volcanic zone; Lava flow; 40 Ar/39 Ar dating; post-collisional extension,,Article,geochemistry;  petrology;  Pliocene;  volcanic rock; Taiwan,,Journal of the Geological Society of China,4,43,scopus,NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY,NOTREPORTED,X
2000.0,J. Geol. Soc. China,Illite crystallinity of oligocene metapelites from NE Taiwan,Lin M;You M,"A total of 47 samples of the Oligocene metapelites collected from the Hsuehshan Range of the Toucheng area, NE Taiwan were studied for illite crystallinity. The illite crystallinity of the studied strata, from top to bottom, is as follows: the Tatungshan Formation: IC (illite crystallinity in air-dried) = 0.32-0.68°Δ2θ and ICgly (illite crystallinity in ethylene glycol-saturated)= 0.29-0.54°Δ2θ; the Tsuku Formation: IC = 0.22-0.49°Δ2θ and ICgly = 0.19-0.40°Ad2θ; the Kankou Formation: IC = 0.24-0.39°Δ2θ and ICgly = 0.23-0.37°Δ2θ; and the Szeleng Sandstone: IC = 0.30-0.40°Δ2θ and ICgly = 0.29-0.37°Δ2θ. The results show that each studied stratigraphic formation does not have its own characteristic IC range. In addition, illite crystallinity could not display systematic change with the stratigraphic sequence along geologic sections. Although, from a mineralogical point of view, it is partially influenced by the extra expandable mineral and detrital 2M muscovite contents within the metapelites, it is still a rather good indicator for determining metamorphic grade in this very low-grade metamorphic terrane. However, illite crystallinity is not a useful tool in stratigraphic idenrtication and correlation, at least in the NE Hsuehshan Range, as compared with vitrinite reflectance.","Department of Earth Science, National Taiwan Normal University, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,,"Lin, M.-L.; Department of Earth Science, Taiwan",,NA NA,Hsuehshan range;  Illite crystallinity;  Metapelite;  Taiwan,,Article,crystallinity;  illite;  metapelite;  Oligocene; Taiwan,,Journal of the Geological Society of China,0,43,scopus,NATIONAL TAIWAN NORMAL UNIVERSITY,DEPARTMENT OF EARTH SCIENCE,X

2000.0,J. Geol. Soc. China,Sequence stratigraphy of the Taipei Basin deposits A preliminary study,Teng L;Yuan P;Yu N;Peng C,"Despite recent intense investigations, the stratigraphy of Late Quaternary Taipei Basin deposits remains fraught with uncertainties and controversies. To improve our understanding of Taipei Basin stratigraphy, a sequence stratigraphic analysis was carried out in 4 deep boreholes recently recovered from the western part of the Basin. For each borehole, the facies successions were established according to an alluvial-lacustrine-estuarine depositional model, and the resultant facies stacking patterns used to delineate the key stratigraphic surfaces, including sequence boundaries, transgressive surfaces, and flooding surfaces. These key surfaces can be correlated among boreholes and used to divide Taipei Basin deposits into 3 sequences and a series of systems tracts. In spite of minor contradictions that remain to be investigated, the proposed sequence stratigraphy is generally consistent with the extant palynostratigraphy and lithostratigraphy. Nevertheless the 14 key surfaces of sequence stratigraphy significantly improve the stratigraphic resolution offered by the 7 zonal boundaries and 4 formational boundaries of palynostratigraphy and lithostratigraphy. In addition, the age of each key surface can be inferred by correlating with the Late Quaternary oxygen isotopic curve and used to constrain the depositional history of each borehole. The agreement between the facies variations and the glaciation-modulated sea level change also demonstrates that Taipei Basin sedimentation was manipulated mainly by eustacy.","Institute of Geology, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,4,1.0,,"Teng, L.S.; Institute of Geology, , Taipei, Taiwan",,NA NA,Quaternary;  Sea level change;  Sedimentation;  Sequence stratigraphy;  Taipei Basin,,Article,Quaternary;  sea level change;  sequence stratigraphy; Taiwan,,Journal of the Geological Society of China,5,43,scopus,NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY,INSTITUTE OF GEOLOGY,X
2000.0,J. Geol. Soc. China,Study on the maifanshih from the coastal range Taiwan,Lin S,"""Maifanshih"" which means a stone having an appearance as a cooked wheat-grained food, has long been said to have functions of purifying and softening water, absorbing odour and cation exchange. The maifanshih specimens in this study were from the southern Coastal Range, Taitung County, Taiwan. Judging from the results of various experiments, these so-called maifanshihes are actually hornblende-rich porphyritic andesites and measured to have the cation-exchange-capacity (C.E.C.). The fundamental factor to cause such an effect is the presence of smectite which was neoformed by alteration chiefly from the primary hornblende in the fresh andesite. By considering the natures regarding its chemical composition, structure type, lattice expansion, electron microscopic feature and its geological occurrence, this smectite is very likely to be a Fe-rich saponite. It should be noted that not all of the so-called maifanshih should contain zeolites, as our specimens actually does not.","Department of Geological Sciences, National Taiwan University, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,1,1.0,,"Lin, S.-B.B.; Department of Geological Sciences, Taiwan",,NA NA,"Andesite with C.E.C.;  Neoformed saponite after hornblende;  Taitung""Maifanshih""",,Article,andesite;  health belief;  lithology; Taiwan,,Journal of the Geological Society of China,2,43,scopus,NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY,DEPARTMENT OF GEOLOGICAL SCIENCES,X
2000.0,J. Geol. Soc. China,Submarine physiographic features in Taiwan region and their geological significance,Yu H;Song G,"The sea floor topography around Taiwan is characterized by its asymmetry of having relatively shallow and flat shelves to the west and markedly deep basins and trenches and high-relief troughs and ridges to the south and east. Tectonics and sedimentation are important factors in forming the submarine topography around Taiwan. Three Pliocene-Quarternary shelves are distributed north and west of Taiwan: East China Sea Shelf (passive margin shelf), the Taiwan Strait Shelf (foreland shelf) and Kaoping Shelf (island shelf) from north to south along the strike of Taiwan orogen. East-west trending ridges of the Yaeyama accretionary wedge and submarine Ryukyu Arc, four offset forearc basins, deep Hualian Canyon-Ryukyu Trench and active backarc basin of southern Okinawa Trough are the major submarine morphologic features in the area off northeastern Taiwan. Off eastern Taiwan, the deep Huatung Basin between the submarine northern Luzon Arc and Gagua Ridge is characterized by relatively flat floor, although several large submarine canyons eroding the basin floor across the basin. Turbidites derived from Taiwan orogen via the submarine canyons are deposited on the basin floor. Off southwestern Taiwan, the broad Kaoping Slope is the major submarine topographic feature. The boundary separating this slope from the South China Sea Slope is the Penghu Canyon. The lower reach of the Penghu Canyon merges gradually into the Manila Trench south of 21°30'N. Off southeastern Taiwan, the forearc region of the Luzon Arc has been deformed into N-S trending ridges and troughs during initial arc-continent collision. The Hengchun Ridge is the most prominent physiographic feature and is the seaward continuation of the Hengchun peninsula. Marine geology in Taiwan region generally reflects a transition from a passive margin to an active margin during the last five million years. Before the collision with the Luzon Arc, the Chinese continental margin in Taiwan has been in a bathymetric setting with shelf, slope, basin and trench with increasing depth in a NE-SW regional trend. After collision with the Luzon Arc and rising of the mountain belt of Taiwan, the continental margin became an active one characterized by a paired thrust-belt and foreland basin, bounded by two remnant marginal ocean basins and transitional subduction-collision systems.","Institute of Oceanography, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,,"Yu, H.-S.; Institute of Oceanography, , Taipei, Taiwan",,NA NA,Physiography;  Sedimentation;  Submarine;  Taiwan;  Tectonics,,Article,seafloor;  sedimentation;  tectonics;  topography; East China Sea;  Taiwan,,Journal of the Geological Society of China,24,43,scopus,NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY,INSTITUTE OF OCEANOGRAPHY,X
2000.0,J. Geol. Soc. China,The future impact of the Tanshui harbor on its nearby coastal environment,Hong E;Ou C;Tseng S;Kuo N;Huang T;Lee W,"Bathymetry, bedforms and distribution of sediments in the offshore area of the Tanshui river estuary are studied using a combined precision echo sounder and a high resolution GeoChirp subbottom profiler and sidescan sonar system. Based on these results and local hydrographic data, regional sediment transportation patterns and hydrodynamic processes are integrated to understand and evaluate the future impact due to construction of the Tanshui harbor on its nearby coastal environment. In general, the study area is relatively flat and smooth with a gradient less than 0.61°. Five echo character types are mapped in this region and inferred as different sedimentary deposits. Dark sandy sediments are derived from the Tanshui river and mainly transported southwestward. They are deposited in the nearshore area as a fan-shaped lobe in a plan view. Meanwhile, brownish, shell-bearing palimpsestic, coarser sediments are distributed further offshore. Besides the predominating southwestward transportation of the stream sediments, the prevailing southly and southeastly waves also induce southwestly longshore drift in the foreshore region. Therefore, construction of the Tanshui harbor will definitely block the southwestward transportation of the stream sediments, which consequently are going to accumulate in the area between the Tanshui estuary and the harbor. On the contrary, the coastal area south of the harbor will suffer beach erosion.","Dept. of Oceanography, Natl.

2000.0,J. Geol. Soc. China,Variations of lithologic characters and claymineral compositions of sediments in the Taipei Basin,Lin S;Chen C,"Eleven drillwell cores from the Taipei Basin were studied for their lithology and mineralogy with their lithologic columns. The Tertiary basement formation at each well-site was respectively identified stratigraphically. As the result, it becomes clear that the basement deepens rapidly from southeast towards northwest, and that the Taipei Fault, one of the important faults in the Basin, is better constrained between NTU-1 and YH-1 boreholes. The Quarternary basin sediments are divided into the Sungshan, Chingmei, and Hsinchuang Formations in the descending order. The last one may be subdivided into the lower and upper members where possible. The Sungshan Fm is essentially the interfingering interbeds of mud and sand, deposited in a brackish, lacustrine environment. The Chingmei Fm is basically a thick-bedded gravel of an alluvial fan deposit, decreasing its thickness toward northeast. However, the Hsinchuang Fm is much variable in lithology and thickness with locations, and often too thin to be subdivided. It is generally formed by several cycles of fluvial sediments starting from gravel, sand to mud. Comparing with the upper part, its lower part (member) is rich in gravel beds which become much greater in grain size, poorer in sorting, more irregular and angular in shape, and more variable in lithic type with the location, indicating that they are debris flows in origin. The lower member in the northeast part is particularly rich in volcanic materials. The main components of clay-minerals in the sediments studied are illite, chlorite, kaolinite, montmorillonite, and mixed-layerclay minerals. Clay mineral contents in each stratigraphic unit is distinctive and, therefore, useful for stratigraphic correlation. Illite and chlorite as major components of the clay-minerals, increase their abundance while kaolinite and montmorillonite decrease from bottom to top. Hence, the ratio of (K+M+Mx) / (I+C) reduces from the Hsinchuang to Sungshan Fm. This fact also reflects a gradual change from a subaerial, fluvial environment at the earlier stage to a brackish, lacustrine one at the later stage. In addition, other lateral variations of clay-mineral composition also occur. For instance, both kaolinite in the Sungshan Fm and montmorillonite in the Chingmei Fm increase from south to north. Similarly, sediments in the northeast part are particularly rich in kaolinite and montmorillonite. All these facts indicate their different source materials for sedimentation. Almost all the clay-mineral particles are detrital in origin. Most of illites and chlorites were carried from the distant submetamorphic argillite-slate area, whereas most of kaolinites and montmorillonites were reworked from the nearby sedimentary strata and volcanic regions. From their nature, it is evident that the sediments have been transported fast without ample chemical weathering and quickly deposited. The clay-mineral composition of the bottom sediments of this basin is significantly controlled by the lithology of the basement. In other words, the basement provided a considerable amount of materials for initial sedimentation. Later, more and more materials were brought in from the surrounding Tertiary sedimentary province and the relatively distant, submetamorphic region southeast to this basin.","Department of Geology, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,,"Lin, S.-B.; Department of Geology, , Taipei, Taiwan",,NA NA,Clay-mineral compositions;  Geological significance;  Lithologic characters;  Taipei basin sediments,,Article,clay mineral;  lithology;  Quaternary;  sedimentary basin; Taiwan,,Journal of the Geological Society of China,1,43,scopus,NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY,NOTREPORTED,X

After more than 25 years of development, three different EEW systems exist in Taiwan. Currently, the nation wide regional EEW system is operated by the Central Weather Bureau (CWB), whereas, a hybrid (regional & onsite) system based on Micro-Electro-Mechanical System sensors is run by National Taiwan University (NTU). The third EEW (onsite system) is run by the National Center for Research on Earthquake Engineering (NCREE). Both CWB and NTU systems are capable of reporting the EEW warnings within 20 seconds of earthquake occurrence. The CWB system is incharge of providing earthquake alerts in Taiwan via text message through mobile phone, TV, and directly broadcasting system to schools and is providing earthquake alarms to the general public since 2016. During recently damaging earthquakes in Taiwan, the NTU system provided 2-8 seconds onsite warning (lead time) in the blind zone around the epicenter. The NTU system also can generate near real-time shake maps for rapid response purposes. The NCREE system consists of about 98 stations and can provide several seconds lead time in the area near the epicenter. The NCREE system also can receive CWB regional EEW messages for warning the regions away from the epicenter. Individually every system has its advantage, however, the hybrid approach will be one of the future systems for real operation.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.;  Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei 11529, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Res Ctr Future Earth, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.;  Minist Earth Sci, Natl Ctr Seismol, New Delhi 110003, India.;  Cent Weather Bur, Taipei 10048, Taiwan.;  Univ Taipei, Dept Earth & Life, Taipei 10048, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Construct Engn, Taipei 10607, Taiwan.;  Natl Ctr Res Earthquake Engn, Taipei 106219, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;INDIA;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,5,1.0,1.0,"Wu, YM (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.; Wu, YM (corresponding author), Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei 11529, Taiwan.; Wu, YM (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Res Ctr Future Earth, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan; Research Center of Future Earth of the National Taiwan University (NTU); National Center for Research on Earthquake Engineering, Taiwan (NCREE); NTU Research Center for Future Earth from the Featured Areas Research Center Program within the Ministry of Education (MOE) in Taiwan","We would like to thank Prof. Harsh Gupta for providing the opportunity to present the development of Taiwan earthquake early warning systems.

This study was designed to investigate the attitudes of earth-science students toward a constructivist teaching approach. Eighty-six ninth-grade students enrolled in two earth-science classes were chosen to participate in the study. A five point Likert-style questionnaire with ten items was administered to the participants to explore their opinions of this teaching method during a six-week intervention. Results of the affective-domain survey strongly suggest that the students held no particular attitudes toward this learning style; yet, they all expressed their understanding of the advantages of the constructivist teaching method in terms of helping them develop science-process skills, improving their thinking skills, and providing opportunities to apply their own ideas. In addition, we also found that student attitudes toward the teaching-learning approach demonstrated a degree of frustration. They realized the advantages of this instructional method; however, they did not view this type of instruction as being promising because it appeared the approach would not help them perform better on their forthcoming achievement tests.","Science Education Center, SZB 340, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, United States",USA,USA,TAIWAN,3,,,"Chang, C.-Y.; Department of Earth Sciences, 88, Section 4, Ting-Chou Road, Taipei 116, Taiwan; 電子郵件: changcy@cc.ntnu.edu.tw",,NA NA,Education - geoscience;  Education - outside United States;  Education - secondary;  Geology - teaching and curriculum,10.5408/1089-9995-47.4.331,Article,Earth science;  education; Taiwan,National Association of Geoscience Teachers Inc.,Journal of Geoscience Education,8,47,scopus,AUSTIN,DEPARTMENT OF EARTH SCIENCES,A

The two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are used as the governing equations with the assumptions of hydrostatic pressure distribution and the Boussinesq approximation. The governing equations are solved using the Galerkin's weighted residual finite element method, with an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian scheme to accommodate the free surface movement. The model developed is validated with the experimental results obtained for gravitational underflows of the Generalized Reservoir Hydrodynamics (GRH) flume at the US Army Corps of Engineers. Then the model is applied to simulate the field scale hydrodynamic and temperature structures for 1-year annual cycle of the Te-Chi reservoir located at central Taiwan. Numerical results depicting the different regimes of density currents such as the turbidity current, underflow and interflow are predicted for sediment-laden inflow during the days of heavy rainfall due to storm.

The probabilistic equation was also applied to the probabilistic design discharge for a debris-flow-prone gully in Taiwan.","Huafan Univ, Dept Environm & Hazards Resistant Design, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Sustainable Environm Res Ctr, Dept Hydraul & Ocean Engn, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,,"Chen, JC (corresponding author), Huafan Univ, Dept Environm & Hazards Resistant Design, Taipei, Taiwan.","National Science Council in TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [NSC95-2221-E-211-001, NSC96-2625-Z-006-014]","The financial support from the National Science Council under Grants NSC95-2221-E-211-001 and NSC96-2625-Z-006-014 in Taiwan is acknowledged.

In this model, the suspended load and bed load are both included to reproduce actual sediment transport characteristics of steep-sloped channels in the chosen study river reaches. A rheological relationship for Bingham fluid and the formula for the sediment carrying capacity, established through laboratory experiments, are used to describe the hyperconcentrated flow behaviour in the model. At peak discharge during Typhoon Morakot, bed shear stress from the hyperconcentrated flow model can be 150% larger than that from the clear water model. According to the simulation for Tung-Pu-Rey Creek, an upstream tributary of Zhuoshui River, the temporal evolution of bed changes obtained from the model can be used to provide plausible explanations for the reasons behind levee failure during Typhoon Toraji.","Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan.;  Zhejiang Univ, Ocean Coll, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.;  Ind Technol Res Inst, Green Energy & Environm Res Labs, Nat Resources Technol Div, High Value Resources Utilizat Res Dept, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan.;  Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Taichung 402, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;CHINA;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,CHINA,6,1.0,,"Lin, YT (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Ocean Coll, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.","National Science Council of TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [NSC 97-2221-E-009-083-MY3]; Water Resources Agency of Taiwan [WRA-0980058]; National Key Research and Development Project of China [2017YFC0405503]; Major scientific and technological special projects in Zhejiang Province of China [2015C03015]","This work was supported by National Science Council of Taiwan [grant number NSC 97-2221-E-009-083-MY3] and Water Resources Agency of Taiwan [grant number WRA-0980058], National Key Research and Development Project of China [grant number 2017YFC0405503].

2018.0,J. Low Freq. Noise Vib. Act. Control,Extracting ground motion characteristics of distant earthquakes for mitigating displacementsensitive equipment,Huang S;Chen C;Loh C;Chang L,"Ground motions induced by strong, distant earthquakes may contain extremely long-period seismic waves that have a dominant period of up to 10 s. In general, these long-period seismic waves have small amplitudes and do not endanger the safety of building structures and civil infrastructures. However, they may bring unexpected shutdown of some vibration (displacement)-sensitive equipment (such as the wafer scanners in high-tech fabs), which can cause production loss. In this study, seismic waveforms collected from broadband seismometers distributed in Taiwan were used to investigate the ground motion characteristics of the collected distant earthquakes (with an epicenter distance of over 1000 km). The time-variant dominant frequency was extracted using moving window wavelet packet transform to monitor significant long-period seismic waves from the preevent data of each seismic event. The slope of the Arias intensity and the slope index of the recorded seismic waves were also developed to detect the potential accumulation of vibration energy increasing with respect to time and amplitude. The proposed index was used to detect the features of significant distant earthquakes, and it provides a mechanism to prevent unexpected shutdown of displacement-sensitive equipment. Finally, the proposed approach is discussed in relation to the damage severity of high-tech fabs. © The Author(s) 2018.","Department of Civil Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,4,1.0,0.0,"Loh, C.-H.; Department of Civil Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: lohc0220@ccms.ntu.edu.tw",,NA NA NA NA,Arias intensity;  Distant earthquake;  high-tech fab;  long-period seismic wave;  singular spectrum analysis;  vibration-sensitive equipment;  wavelet packet transform,10.1177/1461348418781984,Article,Seismic waves;  Seismographs;  Spectrum analysis;  Vibration analysis;  Wavelet analysis;  Wavelet transforms; Arias intensities;  High tech;  Singular spectrum analysis;  Vibration-sensitive equipment;  Wavelet packet transforms; Earthquakes,SAGE Publications Inc.,Journal of Low Frequency Noise Vibration and Active Control,0,37,scopus,NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY,NOTREPORTED,B1

1996.0,J. Metamorph. Geol.,Raman spectrum of carbonaceous material A possible metamorphic grade indicator for lowgrade metamorphic rocks,Yui T;Huang E;Xu J,"Raman spectral analyses of carbonaceous material (CM) extracted from pelitic samples along two sections traversing the metamorphic belt of Taiwan were carried out in the present study. The results show similar spectral variations of CM with metamorphic grade as those documented in the literature. However, continuous sampling from zeolite facies through prehnite-pumpellyite facies to greenschist facies metamorphic rocks in the present study does reveal some interesting features on the Raman spectra of CM that were not noted before. Both the Raman D (disordered-)/O (ordered-) peak area (i.e. integrated intensity) ratio and the D/O peak width (i.e. full width at half maximum, FWHM) ratio of the CM decrease with progressive metamorphism, but the most prominent change in the D/O peak area ratio occurs in samples of lower greenschist facies metamorphic grade, while the most significant decrease in the D/O peak width ratio occurs in samples near the boundary of prehnite-pumpellyite facies and greenschist facies. This phenomenon is interpreted as a result of the decoupling of the changing rates of in-plane crystallite size and degree of defects of CM with progressive metamorphism. It is postulated that the Raman spectrum of CM can serve as a metamorphic grade indicator to distinguish samples of prehnite-pumpellyite facies metamorphic grade from those of greenschist facies metamorphic grade.",,,,TAIWAN,3,,1.0,"Yui, TF (corresponding author), ACAD SINICA, INST EARTH SCI, POB 1-55, TAIPEI 115, TAIWAN.",,,carbonaceous material; metamorphic grade; Raman spectrum; Taiwan,10.1046/j.1525-1314.1996.05792.x,Article,GRAPHITE; CALCITE; GRAPHITIZATION; SPECTROSCOPY; THERMOMETRY; SCATTERING; SCHISTS; MARBLES; JAPAN,WILEY,JOURNAL OF METAMORPHIC GEOLOGY,140,14,ISI,,INST EARTH SCI,B2

This indicates a limited volume diffusion for the cations in substitution (mainly Ca and Fe) and an interface-controlled partition for the extension of a composition-invariant margin. A corrugated interface between the Ca-rich margin/zone and the almandine garnet core is characterized by dislocation arrays and recovery texture further suggesting a resorption process facilitated by diffusion-induced recrystallization, diffusion-induced dislocation migration and diffusion-induced grain boundary migration. Integrated microstructural and chemical studies are essential for understanding the underlying mechanisms of processes such as garnet zoning and its modification.

2017.0,J. Metamorph. Geol.,New PT constraints on the Tamayen glaucophanebearing rocks eastern Taiwan PerpleX modelling results and geodynamic implications,Baziotis I;Tsai C;Ernst W;Jahn B;Iizuka Y,"New pseudosection modelling was applied to better constrain the P-T conditions and evolution of glaucophane-bearing rocks in the Tamayen block of the Yuli belt, recognized as the world's youngest known blueschist complex. Based on the predominant clinoamphibole, textural relationships, and mineral compositions, these glaucophane-bearing high-P rocks can be divided into four types. We focused on the three containing garnet. The chief phase assemblages are (in decreasing mode): amphibole+quartz+epidote+garnet+chlorite+rutile/titanite (Type-I), phengite+amphibole+ quartz+garnet+chlorite+epidote+titanite+biotite+magnetite (Type-II), and amphibole+quartz+albite+epidote+garnet+rutile+hematite+titanite (Type-III). Amphibole exhibits compositional zoning from core to rim as follows: glaucophane pargasitic amphibole actinolite (Type-I), barroisite Mg-katophorite/taramite Fe-glaucophane (Type-II), glaucophane winchite (Type-III). Using petrographic data, mineral compositions and Perple_X modelling (pseudosections and superimposed isopleths), peak P-T conditions were determined as 13 +/- 1kbar and 550 +/- 40 degrees C for Type-I, 10.5 +/- 0.5kbar and 560 +/- 30 degrees C for Type-II (thermal peak) and 11 +/- 1kbar and 530 +/- 30 degrees C for Type-III. The calculations yield higher pressures and temperatures than previously thought; the difference is similar to 1-6kbar and 50-200 degrees C. The three rock types record similar P-T retrograde paths with clockwise trajectories; all rocks followed trajectories with substantial pressure decrease under near-isothermal conditions (Type-I and Type-III), with the probable exception of Type-II where decompression followed colder geotherms. The P-T paths suggest a tectonic environment in which the rocks were exhumed from maximum depths of similar to 45km within a subduction channel along a relative cold geothermal gradient of similar to 11-14 degrees Ckm(-1).","Agr Univ Athens, Mineral Resources & Agr Engn, GR-11855 Athens, Greece.;  Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Studies, Shoufeng Hualien 97401, Taiwan.;  Stanford Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.;  Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei 11529, Taiwan.;",GREECE;TAIWAN;USA;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,GREECE,TAIWAN,5,2.0,1.0,"Tsai, CH (corresponding author), Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Studies, Shoufeng Hualien 97401, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and TechnologyMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [NSC 102-2912-I-259-508, MOST 103-2116-M-259-003, 104-2116-M-259-002]","I.B. and C.H.T. acknowledge a visitor's travel grant (NSC 102-2912-I-259-508) and research grants (MOST 103-2116-M-259-003, 104-2116-M-259-002) respectively from the National Science Council (now Ministry of Science and Technology) of Taiwan (ROC).

2010.0,J. Mt. Sci.,Nonstructural mitigation programs for sedimentrelated disasters after the Chichi Earthquake in Taiwan,Chen S;Huang B,"Following the Chichi Earthquake (ML=7.3) in 1999, sediment-related disasters, such as landslides and debris flows, have become more frequent in Taiwan. Because engineering structures cannot be fully and rapidly emplaced, the government has initiated non-structural hazard mitigation programs. Initially, community debris flow evacuation drills were promoted in 2000. Typhoon Toraji caused numerous debris flow events in July 2001, and some communities evacuated according to the drills, significantly reducing the numbers of possible casualties. Based on that result, the government expanded the program for evacuation drills. Secondly, the early warning system created after the Chichi Earthquake will prevent many potential future casualties. Rainfall threshold values for debris flow warnings in different areas are determined from information received from local weather stations and modified for local geomorphologic situations. Realtime information is gradually being integrated to create a debris flow disaster warning system, the goal of which is to provide warnings to zones in which debris flows are likely. The warning system was launched in 2005 and has two levels of alarms: yellow and red. The final, red alarm triggers enforced evacuation. Overall, the decrease in casualties from debris flows during the decade after the Chichi Earthquake is not the result of a decrease in number or severity of sediment related disasters, but is more directly related to the gradually improved early warning and evacuation system. However, the compound hazards resulting from Typhoon Morakot in 2009 remind us of the ongoing need for improving the existing mitigation system. © 2010 Science Press, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Department of Soil and Water Conservation, National Chung-Hsing University, Taichung 40227, Taiwan; Taitung Branch, Soil and Water Conservation Bureau, Taitung 95055, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,,"Chen, S.-C.; Department of Soil and Water Conservation, , Taichung 40227, Taiwan; 電子郵件: scchen@nchu.edu.tw",,NA NA NA,Chichi Earthquake;  Evacuation and shelter;  Rainfall threshold value for debris flow;  Warning system,10.1007/s11629-010-2021-3,Article,,,Journal of Mountain Science,18,7,scopus,NATIONAL CHUNG-HSING UNIVERSITY,NOTREPORTED,A

2012.0,J. Mt. Sci.,GISbased evaluation on the fault motioninduced coseismic landslides,Huang M;Chen C;Wu T;Chang C;Liu S;Kao C,"Earthquake-induced potential landslides are commonly estimated using landslide susceptibility maps. Nevertheless, the fault location is not identified and the ground motion caused by it is unavailable in the map. Thus, potential coseismic landslides for a specific fault motion-induced earthquake could not be predicted using the map. It is meaningful to incorporate the fault location and ground motion characteristics into the landslide predication model. A new method for a specific fault motion-induced coseismic landslide prediction model using GIS (Geographic Information System) is proposed herein. Location of mountain ridges, slope gradients over 45o, PVGA (Peak Vertical Ground Accelerations) exceeded 0. 15 g, and PHGA (Peak Horizontal Ground Accelerations) exceeded 0. 25 g of slope units were representing locations that initiated landslides during the 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake in Taiwan. These coseismic landslide characteristics were used to identify areas where landslides occurred during Meishan fault motion-induced strong ground motions in Chiayi County in Taiwan. The strong ground motion (over 8 Gal in the database, 1 Gal = 0. 01 m/s2, and 1 g = 981 Gal) characteristics were evaluated by the fault length, site distance to the fault, and topography, and their attenuation relations are presented in GIS. The results of the analysis show that coseismic landslide areas could be identified promptly using GIS. The earthquake intensity and focus depth have visible effects on ground motion. The shallower the focus depth, the larger the magnitude increase of the landslides. The GIS-based landslide predication method is valuable combining the geomorphic characteristics and ground motion attenuation relationships for a potential region landslide hazard assessment and in disaster mitigation planning. © 2012 Science Press, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Science and Technology Center for Disaster Reduction (NCDR), Sindian District, New Taipei City 231, Taiwan; Department of Civil and Water Resources Engineering, Chiayi University, Chiayi City 60004, Taiwan; Institute of Industrial Safety and Disaster Prevention, Chia Nan University of Pharmacy and Science, Tainan City 71710, Taiwan",INDIA;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,INDIA,TAIWAN,6,2.0,1.0,"Chen, C.-Y.; Department of Civil and Water Resources Engineering, , Chiayi City 60004, Taiwan; 電子郵件: chienyuc@mail.ncyu.edu.tw",,This research was supported in part by the Science & Technology Center for Disaster Reduction (NCDR) of Chinese Taipei.

2012.0,J. Mt. Sci.,Landslide and basin selforganized criticality in the Lushan Hot Spring area,Chen C,"Defining a basin under a critical state (or a self-organized criticality) that has the potential to initiate landslides, debris flows, and subsequent sediment disasters, is a key issue for disaster prevention. The Lushan Hot Spring area in Nantou County, Taiwan, suffered serious sediment disasters after typhoons Sinlaku and Jangmi in 2008, and following Typhoon Morakot in 2009. The basin's internal slope instability after the typhoons brought rain was examined using the landslide frequency-area distribution. The critical state indices attributed to landslide frequency-area distribution are discussed and the marginally unstable characteristics of the study area indicated. The landslides were interpreted from Spot 5 images before and after disastrous events. The results of the analysis show that the power-law landslide frequency-area curves in the basin for different rainfall-induced events tend to coincide with a single line. The temporal trend of the rainfall-induced landslide frequency-area distribution shows 1/f noise and scale invariance. A trend exists for landslide frequency-area distribution in log-log space for larger landslides controlled by the historical maximum accumulated rainfall brought by typhoons. The unstable state of the basin, including landslides, breached dams, and debris flows, are parts of the basin's self-organizing processes. The critical state of landslide frequency-area distribution could be estimated by a critical exponent of 1. 0. The distribution could be used for future estimation of the potential landslide magnitude for disaster mitigation and to identify the current state of a basin for management. © 2012 Science Press, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Department of Civil and Water Resources Engineering, Taiwan Chiayi University, Chiayi, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,1,1.0,1.0,"Chen, C.-Y.; Department of Civil and Water Resources Engineering, , Chiayi, Taiwan; 電子郵件: chienyuc@mail.ncyu.edu.tw",,NA NA NA,Debris flow;  Landslide;  Power law;  Self-organized criticality,10.1007/s11629-012-2259-z,Article,,,Journal of Mountain Science,6,9,scopus,TAIWAN CHIAYI UNIVERSITY,DEPARTMENT OF CIVIL AND WATER RESOURCES ENGINEERING,B2
2013.0,J. Mt. Sci.,Comparison between FLO2D and Debris2D on the application of assessment of granular debris flow hazards with case study,Wu Y;Liu K;Chen Y,"Numerical simulation has been widely applied to the assessment of debris flow hazards. In East Asia and especially Taiwan, the most widely used numerical programs are FLO-2D and Debris-2D. Although these two programs are applied to the same engineering tasks, they are different in many aspects. These two programs were compared according to their fundamental theories, input and output data, computational algorithms and results. Using both programs, the simulations of a real debris flow with abundant granular material induced by landslides at Xinfa village in southern Taiwan are performed for comparison. The simulation results show that Debris-2D gives better assessment in hazard area delineating and flow depth predicting. Therefore, Debris-2D is better for simulation of granular debris flows. © 2013 Science Press, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Department of Civil Engineering, National Taiwan University, 10617 Taipei, Taiwan; Hydrotech Research Institute, National Taiwan University, 10617 Taipei, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,1.0,"Liu, K.-F.; Department of Civil Engineering, , 10617 Taipei, Taiwan; 電子郵件: kfliu@ntu.edu.tw","National Science CouncilNational Science Council, NSC",The authors would like to thank the financial support from National Science Council of Chinese NA NA,Debris flow assessment;  Debris-2D;  FLO-2D;  Program comparison,10.1007/s11629-013-2511-1,Article,,Science Press,Journal of Mountain Science,46,10,scopus,NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY;NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY,NOTREPORTED,B2
2013.0,J. Mt. Sci.,FLO2D simulation of mudflow caused by large landslide due to extremely heavy rainfall in southeastern Taiwan during Typhoon Morakot,Peng S;Lu S,"Daniau Village in Daniau Creek Watershed, Taitung County, Taiwan, sustained damages from landslides and mudflows during Typhoon Morakot in 2009. The purpose of this study is to adopt the FLO-2D numerical model recognized by Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to simulate the mudflow, and the Daniau Village was used as a case study, along with rainfall and digital terrain data for this simulation. On the basis of sediment yields, the residual sediment volume in the landslide area was determined to be 33,276 m3 by comparison of digital elevation models (DEMs) and by using the universal soil loss equation (USLE). In addition, this study performed a hydrological frequency analysis of rainfall to estimate the flow discharge as conditions of the simulation. Results of disaster surveys were collected to compare with outputs of the numerical model. Results of the simulation conducted with FLO-2D indicated that if the countermeasure was not destroyed, the drainage work would function without overflow. This study aimed to review the effectiveness of countermeasure on the basis of simulation results obtained by using the model to provide references for future disaster prevention and resident evacuation plans. © 2013 Science Press, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Department of Spatial Design, Chienkuo Technology University, Changhua City, 500, Taiwan",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,1.0,"Peng, S.-H.; Department of Spatial Design, , Changhua City, 500, Taiwan; 電子郵件: shpeng@cc.ctu.edu.tw","Council of AgricultureCouncil of Agriculture, COA National Science CouncilNational Science Council, NSC, NSC 97-2313-B-270-001-MY3 Soil and Water Conservation BureauSoil and Water Conservation Bureau, SWCB","The paper was supported in part by the National Science Council (NSC 97-2313-B-270-001-MY3) and Taitung Branch, Soil and Water Conservation Bureau, Council of Agriculture, Taiwan.

Sci.,Longterm impact of extra sediment on notches and incised meanders in the Hoshe River Taiwan,Chen S;Wu C;Chao Y;Shih P,"The extra sediment load induced by typhoons and rainstorms in the Heshe River, Taiwan, are the principal reason for severe sediment-related disasters. The total sediment load during Typhoon Morakot in 2009 was 31 × 106 m3, accounting for 95% of the annual sediment discharge. Large amounts of sediment load entered the Hoshe River, causing the braiding index (BI) to increase. Subsequently, the BI became positively correlated with the channel width in the Hoshe River. The specific typhoon and rainstorm events decreased after Typhoon Morakot, the sediment input decreased, inducing the fluvial morphology of the braided river to develop into a meandering river. The extra sediment load induced the deposition depth to increase and produce a headward deposition in the main channel and its tributaries. In addition, the river bend and the topographical notch restrained the sediment from moving downstream and being stored locally, indirectly increasing the erosion density of the river banks from 2.5 to 10.5 times. © 2013 Science Press, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Dept. of Soil and Water Conservation, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, 40227, Taiwan; Water Resources Engineering and Conservation, Feng Chia University, Taichung, 40227, Taiwan; not available, NO.250, Kuo-Kuang Rd., 40227 Taichung, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,4,1.0,0.0,"Chao, Y.-C.; not available, NO.250, Kuo-Kuang Rd., 40227 Taichung, Taiwan; 電子郵件: adonis0131@gmail.com",,NA NA NA,Braiding index;  Extra sediment load;  River morphology,10.1007/s11629-013-2620-x,Article,,Science Press,Journal of Mountain Science,5,10,scopus,NATIONAL CHUNG HSING UNIVERSITY;FENG CHIA UNIVERSITY;NOT AVAILABLE,NOT AVAILABLE,B2
2013.0,J. Mt. Sci.,Typhoondominated influence on wood debris distribution and transportation in a high gradient headwater catchment,Chen S;Chao Y;Chan H,"Wood debris is an important component of mountain streams. It causes serious damage and renders difficulty of water resource management in Taiwan. In this study, the quantity of wood debris and variation of migratory wood debris during flood events were examined. The downstream of Gaoshan Creek and Qijiawan Creek, located at Central Taiwan, was selected as the study area. The distribution and dynamic of wood debris in a high gradient headwater catchment were quantified using field surveys. A formula of critical depth for wood debris entrainment was used to evaluate the wood debris migration during three flooding events. In the study area, wood abundance and unit volume increased downstream, and wood density decreased downstream within a channel network. The channel morphology, riparian vegetation, and wood debris characteristics were found to influence the wood storage. As a result, the wood debris has an irregular accumulative distribution in the steep stream, and it migrates easily in the stream because of a high flow discharge. Strong relationships between the channel width and wood debris variables are discovered. Moreover, wood debris has a tendency to accumulate at sites with low stream power and wood debris dams, topographical notches, and unique geological structures. Our findings assist in the understanding of the effects of channel characteristics on distributions of wood debris in steep stream systems. © 2013 Science Press, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Department of Soil and Water Conservation, National Chung Hsing University, No. 250, Kuo-Kuang Rd., 40227 Taichung, Taiwan",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,,"Chao, Y.-C.; Department of Soil and Water Conservation, No. 250, Kuo-Kuang Rd., 40227 Taichung, Taiwan; 電子郵件: d9542007@mail.nchu.edu.tw",,The authors would like to thank the Taiwan Science Council for financially supporting this NA NA,Flood events;  Spatial distribution characteristics;  Wood debris;  Wood debris migration,10.1007/s11629-013-2741-2,Article,,,Journal of Mountain Science,6,10,scopus,NATIONAL CHUNG HSING UNIVERSITY,NOTREPORTED,A
2014.0,J. Mt. Sci.,Numerical simulation on a tremendous debris flow caused by Typhoon Morakot in the Jiaopu Stream Taiwan,Hsu Y;Yen H;Tseng W;Jan C,"In August 2009, Typhoon Morakot brought a large amount of rainfall with both high intensity and long duration to a vast area of Taiwan. Unfortunately, this resulted in a catastrophic landslide in Hsiaolin Village, Taiwan. Meanwhile, large amounts of landslides were formed in the Jiaopu Stream watershed near the southeast part of the Hsiaolin Village. The Hsiaolin Village access road (Provincial Highway No. 21 and Bridge No. 8) was completely destroyed by the landslide and consequent debris flow. The major scope of this study is to apply a debris flow model to simulate the disaster caused by the debris flow that occurred in the Jiaopu Stream during Typhoon Morakot. According to the interviews with local residents, this study applied the destruction time of Bridge No. 8 and Chen's house to verify the numerical debris flow model. By the spatial rainfall distributions information, the numerical simulations of the debris flow are conducted in two stages. In the first stage (before the landslide-dam failure), the elevation of the debris flow and the corresponding potential damages toward residential properties were investigated. In the second stage (after the landslidedam failure), comparisons of simulation results between the longitudinal and cross profiles of the Jiaopu Stream were performed using topographic maps and satellite imagery. In summary, applications of the adopted numerical debris flow model have shown positive impact on supporting better understanding of the occurrence and movement of debris flow processes. © 2014 Science Press, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Department of Hydraulic and Ocean Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, 701, Taiwan; Blackland Research and Extension Center, Texas AandM AgriLife Research, Temple, TX, 720, United States; Sun-Rise Engineering Consultant Company, Taichung, 407, Taiwan",TAIWAN;USA;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,4,1.0,1.0,"Jan, C.-D.; Department of Hydraulic and Ocean Engineering, , Tainan, 701, Taiwan; 電子郵件: cdjan@mail.ncku.edu.tw","101-2218-E-006-001, NSC 101-2625-M-006-001","The authors appreciate support from the National Science Council in Taiwan (NSC 101-2218-E-006-001 and NSC 101-2625-M-006-001), and from the Soil and Water Conservation Bureau Council of Agriculture, Executive Yuan in Taiwan.

2014.0,J. Mt. Sci.,Rapid geometry analysis for earthquakeinduced and rainfallinduced landslide dams in Taiwan,Chen K;Kuo Y;Shieh C,"Stability analysis of the dam is important for disaster prevention and reduction. The dam's geometry plays an important role in understanding its stability. This study develops a rapid landslide dam geometry assessment method for both earthquake-induced and rainfall-induced landslide dams based on nine real cases collected in Chinese Taipei and 214 cases collected worldwide. For simplification purposes, a landslide dam is classified into triangular or trapezoidal. The rapid landslide dam geometry assessment method in this paper uses only satellite maps and the topographic maps to get landslide area, and then analyze the dam geometry. These maps are used to evaluate the area of the landslide and the slope of the river bed. Based on the evaluation information, the proposed method can calculate dam height, the length of the dam, and the angles of the dam in both upstream and downstream directions. These geometry parameters of a landslide dam provide important information for further dam stability analysis. The proposed methodology is applied to a real landslide dam case at Hsiaolin Village. The result shows that the proposed method can be used to assess the landslide dam geometry. © Science Press and Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.","Department of Hydraulic and Ocean Engineering, National Cheng-Kung University, 70101 Tainan, Taiwan",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,1.0,"Kuo, Y.-S.; Department of Hydraulic and Ocean Engineering, , 70101 Tainan, Taiwan; 電子郵件: kuoyushu@mail.ncku.edu.tw",,NA NA NA NA,Dam geometry;  Dam stability analysis;  Landslide dam,10.1007/s11629-013-2664-y,Article,,Science Press,Journal of Mountain Science,16,11,scopus,NATIONAL CHENG-KUNG UNIVERSITY,NOTREPORTED,B2
2014.0,J. Mt. Sci.,Retrieving multiscale climatic variations from high dimensional timeseries modis green vegetation cover in a tropicalsubtropical mountainous island,Chang C;Wang H;Huang C,"There are knowledge gaps in our understanding of vegetation responses to multi-scale climate-related variables in tropical/subtropical mountainous islands in the Asia-Pacific region. Therefore, this study investigated inter-annual vegetation dynamics and regular/irregular climate patterns in Taiwan. We applied principal component analysis (PCA) on 11 years (2001~2011) of high- dimensional monthly photosynthetically active vegetation cover (PV) derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and investigated the relationships between spatiotemporal patterns of the eigenvectors and loadings of each component through time and multi-scale climate- related variations. Results showed that the first five components contributed to 96.4% of the total variance. The first component (PC1, explaining 94.5% of variance) loadings, as expected, were significantly correlated with the temporal dynamics of the PV (r = 0.94), which was mainly governed by regional climate. The temporal loadings of PC2 and PC3 (0.8% and 0.6% of variance, respectively) were significantly correlated with the temporal dynamics of the PV of forests (r = 0.72) and the farmlands (r = 0.80), respectively. The low-order components (PC4 and PC5, 0.3% and 0.2% of variance, respectively) were closely related to the occurrence of drought (r = 0.49) and to irregular ENSO associated climate anomalies (r = -0.54), respectively. Pronounced correlations were also observed between PC5 and the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) with one to three months of time lags (r = -0.35 ~ -0.43, respectively), revealing biophysical memory effects on the time-series pattern of the vegetation through ENSO-related rainfall patterns. Our findings reveal that the sensitivity of the ecosystems in this tropical/subtropical mountainous island may not only be regulated by regional climate and human activities but also be susceptible to large- scale climate anomalies which are crucial and comparable to previous large scale analyses. This study demonstrates that PCA can be an effective tool for analyzing seasonal and inter-annual variability of vegetation dynamics across this tropical/subtropical mountainous islandin the Pacific Ocean, which provides an opportunity to forecast the responses and feedbacks of terrestrial environments to future climate scenarios. © Science Press and Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.","Department of Geography, National Taiwan University, No 1 Sec. 4, Roosevelt Road, Taipei 10617, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,,"Huang, C.-Y.; Department of Geography, No 1 Sec. 4, Roosevelt Road, Taipei 10617, Taiwan; 電子郵件: choying@ntu.edu.tw","National Science CouncilNational Science Council, NSC, 98-2221-E-002-198, 98-2313-B-002-062-MY2, NSC 100-2621-B-002-001-MY3 National Taiwan UniversityNational Taiwan University, NTU, NTU-CESRP-102R7604-2","This work was sponsored by the grants of the National Science Council of Taiwan (NSC 98-2221-E-002-198-, NSC 98-2313-B-002-062-MY2, NSC 100-2621-B-002-001-MY3) and National Taiwan University (EcoNTU: NTU-CESRP-102R7604-2).

2015.0,J. Mt. Sci.,Landslide susceptibility mapping by using landslide ratiobased logistic regression A case study in the southern Taiwan,Wu C,"The object of the research is to compare the model performance and explain the error source of original logistic regression landslide susceptibility model (abbreviated as or-LRLSM) and landslide ratio-based logistic regression landslide susceptibility model (abbreviated as lr-LRLSM) in the Chishan watershed with a serious landslide disaster after 2009 Typhoon Morakot. The landslide inventory induced by 2009 Typhoon Morakot in South Taiwan is the main research material, while the Chishan watershed is the research area. Six variables, including elevation, slope, aspect, geological formation, accumulated rainfall, and bank erosion, were included in the two models. The performance of lr-LRLSM is better than that of or-LRLSM. The Cox &amp; Snell R2, Nagelkerke R2 value, and the area under the relative operating characteristic curve (abbreviated as AUC) of lr-LRLSM is larger than those of or-LRLSM, and the average correct ratio for the lr-LRLSM to predict landslide or non-landslide is larger than that of or-LRLSM by 5.0%. The increase of the average correct ratio (abbreviated as ACR) difference from or-LRLSM to lr-LRLSM shows in slope, revised accumulated rainfall, aspect, geological formation and bank erosion variables, and only light decreases in elevation variable. The error sources of continuous variables in building the or-LRLSM is the dissimilarity between the distribution of landslide ratio and production of coefficient and characteristic values, while those of categorical variables is due to low correlation of landslide ratio and the coefficient value of each parameter. Using the classification of landslide ratio as the database to build logistic regression landslide susceptibility model (abbreviated as LRLSM) can revise the errors. The comparison of or-LRLSM and lr-LRLSM in the Chishan watershed also shows that building the landslide susceptibility model (abbreviated as LSM) by using lr-LRLSM is practical and of better performance than that by using the or-LRLSM. © 2015, Science Press, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Department of Water Resources Engineering and Conservation, Feng Chia University, Taichung, Chinese Taipei, Taiwan",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,1,1.0,1.0,"Wu, C.-H.; Department of Water Resources Engineering and Conservation, Taiwan",,NA NA NA NA,Chishan watershed;  Landslide ratio;  Landslide susceptibility;  Logistic regression;  Typhoon Morakot,10.1007/s11629-014-3416-3,Article,bank erosion;  comparative study;  error analysis;  geological mapping;  landslide;  logistics;  performance assessment;  regression;  slope dynamics;  structural geology;  typhoon;  watershed; Chishan Basin;  Taiwan,Science Press,Journal of Mountain Science,5,12,scopus,FENG CHIA UNIVERSITY,DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES ENGINEERING AND CONSERVATION,B2
2019.0,J. Mt. Sci.,Effects of river flow velocity on the formation of landslide dams,Chen K;Chen X;Hu G;Kuo Y;Chen H,"Natural dams are formed when landslides are triggered by heavy rainfall during extreme weather events in the mountainous areas of Taiwan. During landslide debris movement, two processes occur simultaneously: the movement of landslide debris from a slope onto the riverbed and the erosion of the debris under the action of high-velocity river flow. When the rate of landslide deposition in a river channel is higher than the rate of landslide debris erosion by the river flow, the landslide forms a natural dam by blocking the river channel. In this study, the effects of the rates of river flow erosion and landslide deposition (termed the erosive capacity and depositional capacity, respectively) on the formation of natural dams are quantified using a physics-based approach and are tested using a scaled physical model. We define a dimensionless velocity index vde as the ratio between the depositional capacity of landslide debris (vd) and the erosive capacity of water flow (ve). The experimental test results show that a landslide dam forms when landslide debris moves at high velocity into a river channel where the river-flow velocity is low, that is, the dimensionless velocity index vde > 54. Landslide debris will not have sufficient depositional capacity to block stream flow when the dimensionless velocity index vde < 47. The depositional capacity of a landslide can be determined from the slope angle and the friction of the sliding surface, while the erosive capacity of a dam can be determined using river flow velocity and rainfall conditions. The methodology described in this paper was applied to seven landslide dams that formed in Taiwan on 8 August 2009 during Typhoon Morakot, the Tangjiashan landslide dam case, and the Yingxiu-Wolong highway K24 landslide case. The dimensionless velocity index presented in this paper can be used before a rainstorm event occurs to determine if the formation of a landslide dam is possible. © 2019, Science Press, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Key Laboratory of Mountain Hazards and Earth Surface Processes, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chengdu, 610041, China; Department of Hydraulic and Ocean Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Chinese Taipei, 70101, Taiwan; CAS Center for Excellence in Tibetan Plateau Earth Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China; University of Chinese Academy Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China",CHINA;TAIWAN;CHINA;CHINA,CHINA,TAIWAN,5,2.0,2.0,"Kuo, Y.-S.; Department of Hydraulic and Ocean Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: kuoyushu@mail.ncku.edu.tw","SDS-QN-1912 Center for African StudiesCenter for African Studies, CAS National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, 41501012, 41661144028, 41771045 Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences, CAS Youth Innovation Promotion AssociationYouth Innovation Promotion Association, YIPA, 2017425","We thank three anonymous reviewers for constructive comments on an earlier version of this manuscript.

The analyses were based on the 1999 Taiwan Chi-Chi Earthquake, the largest earthquake in the history in this Region in a hundred years, thus can provide better control on the prediction accuracy of the model. This seismic event has detailed and complete seismic landslide inventories identified by polygons, including 9272 seismic landslide records. Taking into account the real earthquake landslide occurrence area, the difference in landslide area and the non-sliding/sliding sample ratios and other factors, a total of 13,656,000 model training samples were selected. We also considered other seismic landslide influencing factors, including elevation, slope, aspect, topographic wetness index, lithology, distance to fault, peak ground acceleration and rainfall. Bayesian probability method and machine learning model were combined to establish the multi-factor influence of earthquake landslide occurrence model. The model is then applied to the whole Taiwan region using different ground motion peak accelerations (from 0.1 g to 1.0 g with 0.1 g intervals) as a triggering factor to complete the real probability of earthquake landslide map in Taiwan under different peak ground accelerations, and the functional relationship between different Peak Ground Acceleration and their predicted area is obtained. © 2021, Science Press, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Key Laboratory of Seismic and Volcanic Hazards, Institute of Geology, China Earthquake Administration, Beijing, 100029, China; National Institute of Natural Hazards, Ministry of Emergency Management of China (former Institute of Crustal Dynamics, China Earthquake Administration), Beijing, 100085, China; Southern Yunnan Observatory for Cross-block Dynamic Process, Yuxi, 652799, China; Xichang Observatory for Natural Disaster Dynamics of Strike-slip Fault System in the Tibetan Plateau, Xichang, 615000, China; Department of Geosciences, National Taiwan University, Taipei, 106, Taiwan",CHINA;CHINA;CHINA;CHINA;CHINA;CHINA;CHINA;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,CHINA,CHINA,6,8.0,2.0,"Xu, C.; National Institute of Natural Hazards, China; 電子郵件: xc11111111@126.com","National Central UniversityNational Central University, NCU National Key Research and Development Program of ChinaNational Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, 2018YFC1504703",We thank Dr. Chyi-Tyi Lee from National Central University (Chinese Taipei) for sharing an inventory of landslides triggered by the 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake and discussion.

An approach aimed at providing sufficient accuracy with the use of a minimum network of reference stations, and the modelling of GPS errors, has been proposed and tested for regional navigation over the Taiwan area. It has been shown from the test results that medium-range DGPS based on using multi-reference stations is capable of improving the RMS coordinate differences by 35%, when compared to the use of a single reference station.

With its average flow speed of about 2 knots, the Kuroshio can significantly increase the ship's speed for a ""super-slow-steaming""container ship travelling at speeds of 12 knots between the ports of Southeast Asia and Japan. By properly utilizing knowledge of strong ocean currents to follow the Kuroshio on the northbound runs and avoid it on the return trip, considerable fuel can be saved and the transit time can be reduced. In the future, the detailed Kuroshio saving-energy route could be built into electronic chart systems for all navigators and shipping routers.","Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Asia Pacific Ocean Res Ctr, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.;  Naval Postgrad Sch, Dept Oceanog, Monterey, CA 93943 USA.;",TAIWAN;USA,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,5,1.0,,"Chang, YC (corresponding author), Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Asia Pacific Ocean Res Ctr, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.","Aim for the Top University Plan from the Ministry of Education [01C030203]; National Science Council of Taiwan, Republic of ChinaMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [NSC101-2611-M-110-006]","This research was supported by the Grants from Aim for the Top University Plan from the Ministry of Education (01C030203) and National Science Council (NSC101-2611-M-110-006) of Taiwan, Republic of China.

2015.0,J. Navig.,Assessing the Safety Factors of Ship Berthing Operations,Hsu W,"The purpose of this paper is to discuss the safety of ship berthing operations in port. Based on the features of ship's berthing operations and relevant literature, the Safety Factors (SFs) of ship berthing at docks are first investigated. A Safety Index (SI) with a Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) model is then proposed to assess those SFs from port marine pilots, by which port managers and ship carriers may make policies to improve ship berthing safety. To validate the model, berthing operations at Kaohsiung Port in Taiwan were empirically investigated. The results indicate the main safety factors affecting ship berthing at port docks are: working concentration, the condition of mooring lines, emergency response, port policy of improving business and berth length. Based on those results, the theoretical and managerial implications for ship berthing safety at dock are finally discussed.","Natl Kaohsiung Marine Univ, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,1,1.0,,"Hsu, WKK (corresponding author), Natl Kaohsiung Marine Univ, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.",,,Ship berthing; Safety; Fuzzy AHP,10.1017/S0373463314000861,Article,NAVIGATION SAFETY; RISK; WATERS; HEALTH; PORTS,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,JOURNAL OF NAVIGATION,14,68,ISI,NATL KAOHSIUNG MARINE UNIV,NATL KAOHSIUNG MARINE UNIV,A

Navigation efficiency was derived from fuel consumption ratios. Preliminary research results showed that fuel consumption and the amount of carbon dioxide emissions was reduced by transiting from various ports through the European Sea Route, and the navigation efficiencies of the various ports ranked in the following descending order: Yokohama - Busan - Shanghai - Kaohsiung - Hong Kong - Singapore. The higher the ratio was, the lower the navigation efficiency of using the Northern Sea Route, i.e. more fuel was consumed and travel costs were higher. In contrast, the lower the ratio was, the higher the navigation efficiency, i.e. less fuel was consumed and travel costs were lower.

1999.0,J. Paleolimn.,Paleolimnological environment indicated by the diatom and pollen assemblages in an alpine lake in Taiwan,Chen S;Wu J,"Yuanyang Lake (24 degrees 35'N, 121 degrees 24'E), located at an altitude of 1,670 m within a nature preserve in northern Taiwan, is an acidic lake. Remains of diatoms and pollen from a 3.72-m sediment core were used to elucidate the relationships between the vegetation of the watershed and the paleolimnological environment. Past pH, saprobity level, and total P of the lake were inferred from the diatom assemblages and were analyzed with respect to changes in the terrestrial vegetation. The inferred pH values fluctuated only slightly, whereas the inferred saprobity level increased markedly towards the sediment surface. In the topmost sediment, a slight drop in the inferred pH was associated with a lowering in the saprobity index. This was interpreted as a possible result of recent anthropogenic acidification and changes in productivity related to changes in acidity. Based on pollen analyses, we conclude that Chamaecyparis persisted over at least the last four thousand years in the watershed. The vegetation in the watershed changed little during this period of time, which is consistent with the constancy of inferred pH values. A positive correlation between the inferred pH and delta(13)C values of the sediments was found.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Bot, Taipei 10764, Taiwan.; Acad Sinica, Inst Bot, Taipei 11529, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,1.0,"Chen, SH (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Bot, Taipei 10764, Taiwan.",,,acidity; diatoms; lake sediment; paleolimnology; pollen; terrestrial vegetation; Yuanyang Lake; Taiwan,10.1023/A:1008067928365,Article,PH,SPRINGER,JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY,27,22,ISI,NATL TAIWAN UNIV;INST BOT,NATL TAIWAN UNIV,B2
2009.0,J.

A 31.5-cm sediment core that represents deposition from 650 AD to present was taken from a mountain lake, Duck Pond, located 760 m a.s.l. We differentiated five zones using cluster analysis on pollen and spore assemblages. Fluctuations in the relative abundances of arboreal taxa, herbaceous plants, and ferns reflect changes in the relative amounts of woody versus grassland vegetation. Such shifts are associated with changes in temperature and humidity and are consistent with climatic periods reported for the temperate region of central China. Climate changes inferred from the pollen assemblages are also correlated well with changes in the ratios of fern spores to pollen, with organic carbon to nitrogen, and with the delta C-13 values in the sediments. Fluctuations in these data throughout the entire core were in good agreement with the changes in pH inferred from diatom assemblages. This study provides evidence of climate change in northern Taiwan over the past 1.3 millennia, assuming that climate can be inferred from the ratio of arboreal to non-arboreal pollen and from the pH of the aquatic environment.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Life Sci, Taipei 106, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Taipei 106, Taiwan.;  Acad Sinica, Biodivers Res Ctr, Taipei 115, Taiwan.;  Acad Sinica, Res Ctr Environm Change, Taipei 115, Taiwan.; Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Taipei, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,6,1.0,1.0,"Wu, JT (corresponding author), Acad Sinica, Biodivers Res Ctr, Taipei 115, Taiwan.",,,Late Holocene; Paleoclimate; Paleolimnology; Paleopalynology; Diatoms; Subtropical Taiwan,10.1007/s10933-008-9227-1,Article,MEDIEVAL WARM PERIOD; ORGANIC-MATTER; ICE-AGE; NORTHEASTERN TAIWAN; ALPINE LAKE; ILAN PLAIN; ASSEMBLAGES; USA; ENVIRONMENT; INTENSITY,SPRINGER,JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY,19,41,ISI,NATL TAIWAN UNIV;NATL TAIWAN UNIV;ACAD SINICA;ACAD SINICA;NATL TAIWAN UNIV,ACAD SINICA,B2

Diatom assemblages of the last century were dominated by acidophilous species, whereas alkaliphilous taxa dominated the record between AD 1480 and 1910. Over the studied time frame, four decadal periods with high precipitation were inferred from evidence of elevated soil input from the watershed, supported by the stable isotope signatures (delta N-15, delta C-13) of organic matter and magnetic susceptibility of the sediments. We compared the inferred changes in pH of TFL to values obtained from three other Taiwanese subalpine lakes. The present study revealed that elevated precipitation was associated with increased solar irradiance over the last five centuries, with a stable dry period between AD 490 and 1450. Acidification of TFL in the last similar to 100 years was a consequence of deforestation and acid rain.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Life Sci, Taipei 106, Taiwan.;  Univ Gottingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, Dept Palynol & Climate Dynam, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.;  Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei 115, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei 106, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Taipei 106, Taiwan.;  Acad Sinica, Biodivers Res Ctr, Taipei 115, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;GERMANY;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,8,1.0,1.0,"Chen, SH (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Life Sci, Taipei 106, Taiwan.","National Science CouncilMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [NSC97-2621-B-002-MY3, NSC101-2116-M-002-007-, NSC101-2811-M-002-140-]; Interchange Association, JapanInterchange Association, Japan; German Academic ExchangeDeutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD) [99-2911-I-002-059-2]","We thank Dr. Shuh-Ji Kao of the Research Center for Environmental Changes, Academia Sinica for suggestions regarding geochemical analysis and providing water quality data.

,J. Paleolimn.,Paleolimnological evidence for lacustrine environmental evolution and paleotyphoon records during the late Holocene in eastern Taiwan,Wang L;Chou Y;Chen H;Chang Y;Chiang H;Yang T;Shiau L;Chen Y,"The late Holocene lacustrine environmental evolution and paleo-typhoon records are poorly understood around lowland Liyu Lake and mountain Tunlumei Pond in eastern Taiwan. In this study, we use records of diatom populations, magnetic susceptibility, total organic carbon, carbon-to-nitrogen ratio, and delta C-13 from two lacustrine sediment cores in eastern Taiwan to reconstruct the paleoenvironment and the paleo-typhoon records during the late Holocene. Significant changes in lithology and in multi-proxy data in the record from lowland Liyu Lake (LYL) show that LYL became hydrologically isolated by 2850 cal BP, possibly as a result of landslide-induced alluvial fan formation. Synchronous increases of the diatom-inferred lake level proxy for LYL and regional precipitation proxies reflect a strengthened East Asia summer monsoon since 1600 cal BP. Eutrophication of the water in LYL is also inferred, and this is interpreted to be related to agricultural activities, which provides evidence for changes in land use during the past 200 years. The occurrence of diatom valves in sediment of the mountain Tunlumei Pond (TLM) indicates that the pond area has been stable since 760 cal BP, which reflects an increase in the local precipitation. The decrease of diatom-inferred pH indicates an increase in the input of acid runoff from the watershed during typhoon-triggered heavy rainfall. Both lacustrine records suggest that the typhoon intensity increased during the early Little Ice Age. The sediment records in northeastern Taiwan also suggest an increase in typhoon activity during the late Little Ice Age. The asymmetric pattern of typhoon intensity during the last 1000 years is interpreted to reflect the control exerted by anomalies in both global temperature and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation intensity on typhoon tracks over several centuries.","Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Chiayi 621, Taiwan.;  Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Environm & Disaster Monitoring Ctr, Chiayi 621, Taiwan.;  Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Shenzhen Key Lab Marine Archaea Geoom, Shenzhen 518055, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;  Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ocean Sci & Engn, Shenzhen 518055, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;  Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Inst Geosci, Keelung 202, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Ctr Excellence Oceans, Keelung 202, Taiwan.;  Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Oceanog, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.;  CPC Corp, Dept Environm Protect & Ecol Conservat, Taipei 110, Taiwan.;  CPC Corp, Explorat & Dev Res Inst, Miaoli 360, Taiwan.;  Acad Sinica, Res Ctr Environm Changes, Taipei 11529, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;CHINA;CHINA;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,8,1.0,1.0,"Wang, LC (corresponding author), Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Chiayi 621, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and Technology, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 107-2116-M-194-018-, MOST 108-2116-M-194-003-, MOST 109-2116-M-194-011-]; Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Marine Archaea Geo-Omics [ZDSYS20180208184349083]","We thank Dr. Teh-Quei Lee of the Institute of Earth Sciences, Academia Sinica for providing the LYL sediment core.

2004.0,J. Pet.,Geochemical constraints for the Genesis of postcollisional magmatism and the geodynamic evolution of the northern Taiwan region,Wang K;Chung S;O'Reilly S;Sun S;Shinjo R;Chen C,"Taiwan is an active mountain belt created by the oblique collision of the northern Luzon arc with Asia. Late Pliocene extensional collapse of the northern Taiwan mountain belt (NTMB) was accompanied by magmatism that formed the Northern Taiwan Volcanic Zone (NTVZ; 2·8-0·2 Ma). The geochemical characteristics of the NTVZ magmas can thus provide constraints both for the mantle source composition and the geodynamic processes operating in the late orogenic stage of the region. The NTVZ volcanic rocks consist dominantly of calc-alkaline andesites and basalts, along with subordinate but heterogeneous lavas including low-K, shoshonitic and ultrapotassic magmas. From the NE to the SW in the NTVZ the magmas show systematic compositional variations from low-K to calc-alkaline and then shoshonitic. This spatial geochemical variation, characterized by southwesterly increase in potassium and incompatible trace elements, appears to be subparallel to the southwestern part of the modern Ryukyu subduction system. Sr-Nd isotope ratios of the NTVZ volcanic rocks (87 Sr/86 Sr ≈ 0·70376-0·70551; 143 Nd/144 Nd ≈ 0·51259-0·51301) suggest that two mantle source components are involved in the magma generation, the asthenosphere and metasomatized subcontinental lithospheric mantle. These two components are represented by the 2·6 Ma Mienhuayu high-Mg basaltic andesites and the 0·2 Ma Tsaolingshan high-Mg potassic lavas, respectively. The latter are interpreted to be the products of small-degree melting of a phlogopite-bearing, harzburgite lithospheric mantle source metasomatized recently by the nearby Ryukyu subduction zone processes. The Sr-Nd-Pb isotope systematics and specific trace-element ratios of the NTVZ volcanic rocks suggest that melts derived from subducted sediments and fluids released from slab dehydration reactions were both involved in metasomatizing this mantle source. The unique spatial geochemical variation of the NTVZ volcanic rocks can be successfully modelled using variable degrees of partial melting of the mantle source regions, coupled with mixing of different melt components from depleted asthenospheric and metasomatized lithospheric mantle components beneath individual volcanic fields. It is inferred that mixing of melts from specific mantle components and the degree of partial melting are spatially and temporally related to the tectonic evolution of the northern Taiwan region, and not simply due directly to subduction zone processes. The overall NTVZ geochemical characteristics can be explained by various degrees of melting within an ascending region of the asthenospheric mantle, triggered by extensional collapse of the NTMB, and interaction of these melts with overlying fluid- and sediment-modified lithospheric mantle. © Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.","Department of Geosciences, National Taiwan University, PO Box 13-318, Taipei 106, Taiwan; GEMOC, Department of Earth/Planet.

2020.0,J. Pet. Geol.,GASHYDRATE SYSTEMS AND GAS VOLUMETRIC ASSESSMENT IN THE LOWER FANGLIAO BASIN TAIWAN ACCRETIONARY WEDGE,Dirgantara F;Lin A;Liu C;Lin C;Chen S,"The accretionary wedge in the incipient arc-continent collisional zone offshore southwestern Taiwan is rich in gas hydrates as inferred from reflection seismic data and the geochemical analyses of shallow sediments. In this study, 2D and 3D seismic data were used to investigate the role of structural factors including mud diapirism on the formation of gas hydrates and associated free gas in the Quaternary Lower Fangliao Basin, a semi-enclosed slope basin situated on the upper accretionary wedge. Albeit limited drilling information on lithostratigraphy and petroleum potential in the area together with seismic reflection data show that mud diapirs have influenced the formation of bottom-simulating reflectors (BSRs) and the distribution of gas hydrates and free gas. On reflection seismic profiles, five seismic facies were observed and are characterised by: stratified parallel reflections; contorted reflections; semi-parallel, high-amplitude reflections; oblique, continuous high-amplitude reflections; and generally transparent reflections. These seismic facies were respectively interpreted as hemipelagic sediments, mass transport deposits (MTDs), sandstone-rich turbidites, overbank deposits and mud diapirs. The gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ) is characterized by (i) high amplitude reflections with an analogous phase to that of seafloor, possibly indicating potential porous sandstone-rich turbidite reservoirs; (ii) BSRs showing polarity reversal relative to seafloor, suggesting higher impedance gas hydrates overlying lower impedance intervals with free gas; (iii) blanking reflections in fault zones, interpreted as gas-bearing fluid conduits; (iv) strong reflections on the flanks of mud diapirs (e.g. flank drags) and above buried mud diapirs, demonstrating the presence of gas hydrates; (v) high amplitude reflections dragging on diapiric flanks with reversed phase to that of seafloor, indicating free gas -charged zones abutting mud diapirs; and (vi) the presence of focused advection and diffusion flow through mud diapirs and faults, which is interpreted to control the migration of thermogenic gas. Based on the distribution of seismic amplitude characteristics and reflection strength with respect to depth of the BSRs, hydrocarbon prospects can be divided into gas-hydrate compartments above BSRs, free gas compartments above BSRs, and free gas compartments below BSRs. From a combination of geobody extraction and Monte Carlo simulation, the prospects appear to hold about 2048 Bcf (billion cubic feet) of total gas volume over a study area of 60 km2.

Paracalanus aculeatus, Oncaea venusta and Clausocalanus furcatus were the three dominant species, comprising 43% of the total copepod numbers. Most copepod species performed normal diel vertical migration, descending during daytime and ascending at night to different depth zones and with different rates. Some dominant copepod species, such as P. aculeatus, C. furcatus, Temora discaudata and Canthocalanus pauper, apparently congregated in the surface water (between 0 and similar to1 m) at night but became sparse in the upper 250 m of the water column during the day. Some copepods stayed in deeper water and occasionally ascended to the subsurface layer at night or twilight (i.e. Subeucalanus mucronatus), while others exhibited no apparent diel vertical migration or reverse diel vertical migration in the depth below the subsurface layer.","Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Inst Marine Resources, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan.; Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, Taipei 10764, Taiwan.; Canadian Museum Nat, Ottawa, ON K1P 6P4, Canada.; Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Inst Marine Biol, Chilung, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;CANADA;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,,"Lo, WT (corresponding author), Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Inst Marine Resources, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan.",,,,10.1093/plankt/fbh004,Article,TAXONOMIC COMPOSITION; CALANOID COPEPODS; COASTAL WATERS; ZOOPLANKTON; DISTRIBUTIONS; LARVAE; FISH,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH,40,26,ISI,NATL SUN YAT SEN UNIV;NATL TAIWAN UNIV;NATL TAIWAN OCEAN UNIV,NATL SUN YAT SEN UNIV,A

We conducted a 5-year study between October 1998 and September 2003 to assess the influence of the northeast (NE) and the southwest (SW) monsoons on copepod assemblages in the area. A total of 110 copepod species were identified. Temora turbinata, Paracalanus aculeatus, Acrocalanus gibber, Parvocalanus crassirostris and Oithona rigida comprised 80% of the copepod assemblages that consisted of coastal species from the East China Sea and species associated with the Kuroshio Branch Current. The effect of the NE monsoon was observed during a short period of each winter when species such as Calanus sinicus were transported into the study area by the China Coastal Current. In summer, species such as A. gibber, Acrocalanus gracilis and Canthocalanus pauper may be transported into the study area from Southern Taiwan by the combined effect of the SW monsoon and the Kuroshio Current. Influence of the NE monsoon on the copepod assemblages in terms of introduction of species from the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea during winter was observed every year but was unlikely to represent an important carbon source into the region due to its short-term nature. Local species such as T. turbinata, P. crassirostris and O. rigida form a major component of the copepod assemblage. The high copepod diversity in the area was caused by the year-round presence of many local species and the aggregation of different species from subtropical, tropical, and temperate water masses. Monsoon-driven water currents and the Kuroshio Branch Current appeared to mask the effect of river discharge in the region.","Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Inst Marine Biol, Chilung, Taiwan.; Univ Sci & Tech Lille Flandres Artois, CNRS, UMR 8013 Elico, Stn Marine Wimereux,Ecosyst Complex Res Grp, F-62930 Wimereux, France.; Flinders Univ S Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia.; Natl Museum Marine Biol & Aquarium, Pingtung, Taiwan.; Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Inst Marine Biotechnol, Hualien, Taiwan.; Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Dept Marine Environm Informat, Chilung, Taiwan.; Acad Sinica, S China Sea Inst Oceanog, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.; Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Biol, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;",TAIWAN;FRANCE;AUSTRALIA;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;CHINA;CHINA,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,15,1.0,,"Hwang, JS (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Inst Marine Biol, Chilung, Taiwan.",,,,10.1093/plankt/fbl031,Article,INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; TAXONOMIC COMPOSITION; SPECIES ASSEMBLAGES; SEASONAL-VARIATION; TORTANUS COPEPODA; CALANOID COPEPODS; CIRCULATION; KUROSHIO; DIVERSITY; VICINITY,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH,86,28,ISI,NATL TAIWAN OCEAN UNIV;UNIV SCI AND TECH LILLE FLANDRES ARTOIS;FLINDERS UNIV S AUSTRALIA;NATL MUSEUM MARINE BIOL AND AQUARIUM;NATL DONG HWA UNIV;NATL TAIWAN OCEAN UNIV;S CHINA SEA INST OCEANOG;CHINESE UNIV HONG KONG,NATL TAIWAN OCEAN UNIV,A
2007.0,J. Plankton Res.,An overview of the influence of hydrodynamics on the spatial and temporal patterns of calanoid copepod communities around Taiwan,Dur G;Hwang J;Souissi S;Tseng L;Wu C;Hsiao S;Chen Q,"Taiwan waters are oceanographically complex, being characterized by different water masses in the East China Sea, the South China Sea, the Pacific Ocean and the Taiwan Strait, which form contiguous but distinct ecosystems. These ecosystems interact one with another through complex and strong water circulations. The present work investigates the relatively few studied interactions between the local copepod communities and the heterogeneous hydrodynamical regimes. Gathering data from 53 cruises carried out since June 1998 to October 2004 all around Taiwan, this study leads to the mapping of eleven local calanoid assemblages taking into account the physical properties of the environment in which they appeared and the characteristics of their indicator species. Three of these identified assemblages were located in the tropical waters, southwest of Taiwan. First, the assemblage of the 2001 South China Sea sampling cruises revealed a tropical community dominated by Acrocalanus gracilis and Undinula vulgaris. In the other cluster, tropical calanoid species such as Labidocera detruncata, Centropages calaninus and A. monachus were found. The eight other assemblages were associated with the seasonal dynamics of the water masses north of Taiwan. Although the seasonal characteristics in the north can be subtle, the demarcation between these assemblages was clear. The early spring community is dominated by Calanus sinicus and followed by Temora turbinata since the beginning of summer. September marks a transition period to a new community characterized by the indicator species A. gibber. When the north-easterly monsoon prevails in winter, it is the turn of the community of northern common species such as Paracalanus parvus and Euchaeta concinna to prevail. In the mean time, C. sinicus starts its intrusion from the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea towards the northwest of Taiwan. Thus, according to our results, identified assemblages appear to be good indicators of different, distinctive, water masses.","Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Inst Marine Biol, Keelung 20224, Taiwan.;  Univ Sci & Technol Lille, Ecosyst Complex Res Grp, Stn Marine Wimereux, Cnrs Fre Elico 2816, F-62930 Wimereux, France.;  Chinese Acad Sci, S China Sea Inst Oceanol, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China.;",TAIWAN;FRANCE;CHINA,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,7,1.0,,"Hwang, JS (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Inst Marine Biol, 2 Pei Ning Rd, Keelung 20224, Taiwan.","National Science Council, ROCMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [NSC 94-2621-B-019-001, NSC 95-2621-B-019-002]; Center for Marine Bioscience and Biotechnology, National Taiwan Ocean University; National Science Council, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [NSC 95-2621-B-019-002]; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS, France)Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)","This research was supported by Grants NSC 94-2621-B-019-001 and NSC 95-2621-B-019-002 from the National Science Council, ROC, and from the Center for Marine Bioscience and Biotechnology, National Taiwan Ocean University to J.S.H.

A total of 426 taxa of larval fish belonging to 213 genera and 109 families were recognized in our samples. Larval fish abundances in the two seasons were similar, but species composition showed significant differences and the species composition was more diverse in spring than in winter. Multi-dimensional scaling analysis revealed two seasonal station groups. Higher abundance and lower species diversity generally were found in waters west of Taiwan where the China Coastal Current prevails, and an opposite trend was observed in the waters east of Taiwan where the Kuroshio Current dominates. The distribution patterns in abundance and species assemblages were closely linked with the hydrographic conditions, and well matched with abundance of phyto- and zooplankton. Food availability may be another important factor affecting the distribution of larval fish assemblages in the waters around Taiwan. In addition, the intrusion of the Kuroshio Branch Current may bring larvae of some fish species into the Taiwan Strait in spring. The succession of water masses induced by the monsoon may also affect the distribution patterns of larval fish assemblages in the waters around Taiwan.","Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Marine Biotechnol & Resources, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan.;  Council Agr, Fisheries Res Inst, Coastal & Offshore Resources Res Ctr, Kaohsiung 80672, Taiwan.;  Council Agr, Fisheries Res Inst, Chilung 20246, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,6,1.0,,"Hsieh, HY (corresponding author), Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Marine Biotechnol & Resources, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan.","National Science CouncilMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan; Ministry of Education of the Republic of ChinaMinistry of Education, Taiwan [NSC96-2611-Z110-006, 97C030200]",This research was supported by grants from the National Science Council and the Ministry of Education of the Republic of China to W.T.L.

2010.0,J. Plankton Res.,Effects of semidiurnal tidal circulation on the distribution of holo and meroplankton in a subtropical estuary,Hsieh H;Fan L;Chen C;Wu J;Liu W,"We examined how tidal changes and which physical factors affected holo- and meroplankton assemblages in a subtropical estuary in Taiwan in February 1999. A factor analysis showed that during tidal flooding, the water mass properties changed from low salinity (5-16) and high particulate organic carbon (POC, 2.6-4.5 mg L-1) content to increasing salinity and high total suspended matter content (29.0-104.5 mg L-1). With a receding tide, the water became more saline again, and its velocity increased (from non-detectable to 0.67 m s(-1)). One-way ANOVA showed that the distributions of four dominant taxa were affected by the ebb tide and exhibited two distinct groups. The first group consisted of non-motile invertebrate eggs and weakly swimming polychaete sabellid embryos and larvae (at densities of 1.25-1.40 ind. L-1), while the second consisted of better-swimming copepods and polychaete spionid larvae (at densities of 0.70-1.65 ind. L-1). A canonical correlation analysis demonstrated that the former group occurred at sites with greater freshwater input, higher POC content and greater depth, whereas the latter group was significantly associated with sites subject to seawater and faster flows. We propose that a two-layered circulation process and tidally induced oscillations in water movements might account for the distributional differences between these two groups.","Acad Sinica, Biodivers Res Ctr, Taipei 115, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, Taipei 106, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Fisheries Sci, Taipei 106, Taiwan.;  Natl United Univ, Dept Civil & Disaster Prevent Engn, Lienda 360, Miaoli, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,5,1.0,,"Hsieh, HL (corresponding author), Acad Sinica, Biodivers Res Ctr, 128 Acad Rd,Sec 2, Taipei 115, Taiwan.","Academia Sinica, TaiwanAcademia Sinica - Taiwan","This study was funded through Thematic Research Program by Academia Sinica, Taiwan.",tidal circulation; holo- and meroplankton distribution; subtropical estuary,10.1093/plankt/fbq026,Article,COHESIVE SEDIMENT TRANSPORT; RIVER; POLYCHAETA; SETTLEMENT; BEHAVIOR; LARVAE,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH,17,32,ISI,ACAD SINICA;NATL TAIWAN UNIV;NATL TAIWAN UNIV;NATL UNITED UNIV,ACAD SINICA,A

2007.0,J. Sediment. Res.,Selfsimilar evolution of semiinfinite alluvial channels with moving boundaries,Capart H;Bellal M;Young D,"Mathematical solutions are obtained for several sedimentary problems featuring semi-infinite alluvial channels evolving under diffusional sediment transport. Moving boundaries are considered at one end of the channels, and represent transitions between alluvial reaches and either bedrock-floored channels or bodies of standing water. Three elementary cases are considered: bedrock-alluvial transitions, lake breaches, and prograding deltas. It is shown that idealized formulations of all three problems share the same mathematical structure and admit exact similarity solutions. Elementary solutions can further be assembled to describe composite profiles. This is illustrated by the case of a natural lake undergoing simultaneous breaching and backfill. For both elementary and composite cases, the explicit solutions clarify the link between alluvial profile evolution and the migration of channel boundaries. For the case of lake breaching, for instance, the outlet channel profile is controlled simultaneously by downwards incision and upstream migration of the channel head. The pace of the resulting water-level drawdown in turn affects the form of the backfill deposits upstream of the lake.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Taipei 106, Taiwan.; Natl Taiwan Univ, Hydrotech Res Inst, Taipei 106, Taiwan.; Univ Catholique Louvain, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;BELGIUM,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,,"Capart, H (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Taipei 106, Taiwan.",,,,10.2110/jsr.2007.009,Article,STEFAN PROBLEM; LAKE; SEDIMENTATION; DRAINAGE; TAIWAN; MODELS; RIVER,SEPM-SOC SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY,JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH,31,77,ISI,NATL TAIWAN UNIV;NATL TAIWAN UNIV;UNIV CATHOLIQUE LOUVAIN,NATL TAIWAN UNIV,A

Critical-wedge theory predicts asymmetrical tectonic development of the pro- and retro- sides of an orogen. Whereas the consequences for exhumation, peak metamorphism, and erosion have been extensively investigated, the implications for sandstone petrography preserved on either side of an orogen have not been adequately documented. Plio-Pleistocene sandstones from the Western Foothills of Taiwan were deposited in a rapidly subsiding foreland basin recording the collision between a volcanic arc and the Asian passive margin. New data on the evolution of sedimentary petrography and clay minerals preserved in Miocene to Pleistocene sandstone of the western pro-foreland basin record the history of Taiwan's orogenesis. Sandstone petrography of the eastern basin on the retro-side of Taiwan's orogenic wedge had been studied previously. Comparison of the provenance record from the western and eastern basins illustrates the opposing signature of unroofing and recycling, held to be characteristic of an asymmetric orogenic wedge. Sandstone petrography can be used in ancient sedimentary basins to complement other indications of the polarity of subduction.","Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Earth Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.;  Univ Geneva, Dept Geol & Paleontol, CH-1205 Geneva, Switzerland.;  Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, I-20126 Milan, Italy.;  Natl Cent Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Taoyuan 101, Taiwan.;  Univ Paris 06, ISTEP, UMR 71934, F-75252 Paris 05, France.;  Univ Lausanne, ISTE, Inst Sci Terre, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.;",SWITZERLAND;SWITZERLAND;ITALY;TAIWAN;FRANCE;SWITZERLAND,SWITZERLAND,SWITZERLAND,8,4.0,2.0,"Nagel, S (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Earth Sci, Sonneggstr 5, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",SNSF Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [200020-131890],"This paper stemmed from the first author's Ph.D. thesis work, supervised by S.

Red soil profile of the Taoyuan terrace was employed to demonstrate its different extents of lateritic weathering. The objectives of this study were to compare the physicochemical properties of lateritic soils and gravel soil layers and identify using conventional and synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses mineral species in nanoparticles separated by automated ultrafiltration device (AUD) apparatus. Materials and methods: Soil samples were collected from paleo-environmental lateritic soils. Soil samples were examined using elemental analysis, conventional and synchrotron XRD analyses, high gradient magnetic separation, separation and collection of nanoparticles by AUD apparatus, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Results and discussion: The soil pH, redness index, quantities of free Al- and Fe-oxides (Ald and Fed), and clay content of lateritic soils are higher than those of gravel soil layers. Illite, kaolinite, gibbsite, quartz, goethite, and hematite were identified in clay fractions and nanoparticles by conventional and synchrotron XRD analyses. TEM images show presence of hematite nanoparticles on the surface coating of kaolinite nanoparticles and aggregated hematite nanoparticles overlapping the edge of a kaolinite flake in a size range of 4-7 nm. Synchrotron XRD techniques are more straightforward and powerful than conventional XRD with random powder methods for identifying nanoparticles in red soils, particularly for illite, kaolinite, goethite, and hematite nanoparticles. According to chemical compositions of clay fractions and red soil features in the Taoyuan terrace, these red soils can be taken as lateritic red earths or red earths. Conclusions: This work suggests that physicochemical properties, mineral species, and micromorphology of red soil at all depths can shed light on the extent of paleo-environmental lateritic weathering. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","The Experimental Forest, National Taiwan University, No. 12, Section 1, Chienshan Road, Chushan, Nantou 55750, Taiwan; Biodiversity Research Center, Academia Sinica, 128, Academia Road, Section 2, Nankang, Taipei 11529, Taiwan; Natural Synchrotron Radiation Research Center, 101 Hsinann Road, Hsinchu Science Park, Hsinchu 30076, Taiwan; State Key Laboratory of Soil and Sustainable Agriculture, Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing 210008, China; Central Geological Survey, Ministry of Economic Affairs, Taiwan, No. 2, Lane 109, Huaxin Street, Zhonghe, New Taipei City 235, Taiwan; Department of Agricultural Chemistry, National Taiwan University, No. 1, Section 4, Roosevelt Road, Taipei 10617, Taiwan; Department of Marine Resource, National Sun Yat-Sen University, No. 70, Lienhai Road, Kaohsiung 425, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;CHINA;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,10,1.0,1.0,"Wang, M.

2014.0,J. Soils Sed.,Soluble organic C and N and their relationships with soil organic C and N and microbial characteristics in moso bamboo Phyllostachys edulis plantations along an elevation gradient in Central Taiwan,Huang C;Jien S;Chen T;Tian G;Chiu C,"Purpose: Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis), an important economic crop, is distributed from low- to medium-elevation mountains in Taiwan. Bamboo is a fast-growing herbaceous species with an extensive rhizome structure. With the hypothesis that the characteristics of soil organic matter and microbes might change after long-term bamboo plantation, we investigated different fractions of organic C and N as well as soil microbial biomass and activities in five moso bamboo plantations along an elevation gradient in Central Taiwan. Materials and methods: Five soil samples (top 10 cm of soil) were collected from each bamboo plantation (600, 800, 1,000, 1,200, and 1,400 m above sea level (asl)) in January 2011. Soil was processed and analyzed for soil total C and N contents, biologically available C, potentially mineralizable N, soil microbial biomass and soil respiration (CO 2 ). Two extraction methods (2 M KCl and hot-water extraction) were used to estimate soil soluble organic C and N (S b OC and S b ON) and soil inorganic N (NH 4 + and NO 3 - ) concentrations to evaluate the relationship with soil organic matter and microbe characteristics in bamboo plantations. Results and discussion: Soil total C and N contents as well as soil microbial biomass and soil respiration (CO 2 ) of the bamboo plantations increased along the elevation gradient. Temperature changes along elevation contributed to such variations observed among the selected bamboo plantations. The S b ON in hot-water extracts was highest in the 1,200-m plantation, then in the 1,400-m plantation, and lowest in the low-elevation plantations (600, 800, and 1,000 m). However, S b ON in 2 M KCl extracts did not differ by elevation. The S b ON was strongly correlated with soil total N in both 2 M KCl and hot-water extracts, but only S b ON in hot-water extracts was strongly correlated with microbial biomass N and potentially mineralizable N. S b OC was strongly correlated with soil total C content, microbial biomass C, and biologically available C in both 2 M KCl and hot-water extracts. Conclusions: Soil total C and N, S b OC and S b ON, and microbial biomass characteristics increased in the moso bamboo plantations with increasing elevation. No altitudinal difference in specific soil respiration (CO 2 ) rate suggested that the enhanced potentially mineralizable N and soil respiration (CO 2 ) in the high-elevation plantations were associated with increased microbial biomass rather than microbial activities. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Biodiversity Research Center, Academia Sinica, Nankang, Taipei, 11529, Taiwan; Department of Soil and Water Conservation, National Pingtung University of Science and Technology, Pingtung, 91201, Taiwan; Taiwan Forestry Research Institute, Taipei, 10066, Taiwan; Environmental Monitoring and Research Division, Monitoring and Research Department, Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago (MWRD), Lue-Hing RandD Laboratory, 6001 W.

2015.0,J. Soils Sed.,Occurrence and distribution of phthalate esters and pharmaceuticals in Taiwan river sediments,Yang G;Wang C;Chiu Y,"Purpose: Phthalate esters (PAEs), pharmaceuticals, and personal care products (PPCPs) are used in industry, biosciences, agriculture, animal husbandry, food industry, and by humans. The aim of this study was to understand the occurrence, spatial distribution, and temporal variation of six phthalate esters and pharmaceuticals in river sediments in Taiwan. Materials and methods: Surface sediments were sampled seven times at five bridge sites along the Dianbao River in Southern Taiwan. The sediment samples were collected using an Ekman grab sampler. Sediment extraction was performed with an ultrasonic probe, and the extracts were analyzed to determine 6 phthalate esters, 18 antibiotics, and 10 nonantibiotics, using liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS). Results and discussion: The average concentrations of PAEs were &lt;1 to 1949 μg kg−1 dry weight (dw), with di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate being the highest and butyl benzyl phthalate the lowest. Four antibiotics (i.e., ciprofloxacin, lincomycin, norfloxacin, and sulfathiazole) and four nonantibiotics (i.e., caffeine, triclosan, acetaminophen, and sulfamethoxazole) were detected with average concentrations ranging from non-detectable to 9 μg kg−1 dw. Higher concentrations correlated with specific discharge sources and the rainy season. Compared to PAEs and pharmaceuticals in river sediments around the world, the Dianbao River sediments are less contaminated except for di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP), which is the second highest in the world. Conclusions: Compared to other rivers, the Dianbao River sediments are less contaminated except for DnBP. The monitoring of pharmaceuticals in river sediments is the first of its kind in Taiwan. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Institute of Environmental Engineering, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, 80424, Taiwan; Center for Emerging Contaminants Research, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, 80424, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,,"Wang, C.-L.; Institute of Environmental Engineering, Taiwan","National Sun Yat-sen UniversityNational Sun Yat-sen University, NSYSU",This work was sponsored by NSYSU Project on “Aim for Top University and Elite Research Center.” NA NA NA,Dianbao River;  LC-MS/MS;  Pharmaceuticals;  Phthalate esters;  Sediments,10.1007/s11368-014-1003-4,Article,,Springer Verlag,Journal of Soils and Sediments,19,15,scopus,NATIONAL SUN YAT-SEN UNIVERSITY;NATIONAL SUN YAT-SEN UNIVERSITY,INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING,A
2016.0,J. Soils Sed.,Combined effect of rice genotypes and soil characteristics on iron plaque formation related to Pb uptake by rice in paddy soils,Li F;Yang C;Syu C;Lee D;Tsuang B;Juang K,"Purpose: The formation of iron plaques and their ability to sequester heavy metals are influenced by soil properties and rice genotype. Lead accumulation in paddy soil is increasing, but in order to assess soil suitability for rice cultivation, a better understanding of the effects of iron plaques on Pb uptake by paddy rice is needed. Materials and methods: Two rice cultivars, Taikang 16 (TK16) and Taichung Sen 10 (TCS10), were grown in pots to assess lead (Pb) uptake. Three paddy soils (C, D, and N) sampled from potentially contaminated sites in central Taiwan were used for the experiment, with additional Pb spiking (0, 150, and 300 mg kg−1). Results and discussion: Pb uptake by rice plants was positively correlated with soil Pb availability. However, Pb uptake by rice plants in soils D and N, even with higher Pb availability, was much less than in soil C. We attribute this to the large amount of iron plaques coating the root surfaces of plants in soils D and N. Moreover, TCS10, which is an indica rice sensitive to metal stress, took up more Pb than TK16, which is a japonica rice. Iron plaque formation on the roots of TK16 was superior to that on the roots of TCS10. Conclusions: Iron plaque formation that inhibits Pb uptake appears to be driven primarily by the soil properties and secondarily by the rice genotype. Nevertheless, the capacity of iron plaques to sequester Pb is limited by a high level of Pb contamination in the soil. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Department of Agronomy, National Chiayi University, Chiayi City, 60004, Taiwan; Department of Agricultural Chemistry, National Taiwan University, Taipei City, Taiwan; Department of Environmental Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung City, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,6,1.0,,"Juang, K.-W.; Department of Agronomy, Taiwan; 電子郵件: kwjuang@mail.ncyu.edu.tw","Council of AgricultureCouncil of Agriculture, COA, 101AS-14.2.3-FD-Z1, 102AS-14.2.3-FD-Z1, 103AS-14.2.3-FD-Z1","This research was sponsored by the Agriculture and Food Agency, Council of Agriculture, Executive Yuan, Taiwan, under Grant Nos. 101AS-14.2.3-FD-Z1(4), 102AS-14.2.3-FD-Z1(4), and 103AS-14.2.3-FD-Z1(2).

2017.0,J. Soils Sed.,Emulsionenhanced recovery and biodegradation of decabrominated diphenyl ether in river sediments,Chang S;Wang W;Chen Y;Chen T;Chiang P;Lo Y,"Purpose: Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are flame retardants and regarded as emerging contaminants and persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Due to high lipophilicity and low biodegradability, they tend to accumulate in sediments. Decabrominated diphenyl ether (BDE-209) is the most predominant congener among 209 PBDE congeners in river sediments, accounting for more than 90 % of total PBDEs in most samples. This study is to explore the feasibility of an integrated remedial approach, direct removal by emulsion recovery and subsequent biological reductive debromination. Materials and methods: A double emulsion (water in oil in water) was formulated and used in direct recovery of BDE-209 in sediment samples. After this recovery operation, the residual oil left in sediments was used as an electron donor for anaerobic microbial reductive debromination. In order to improve the robustness of this direct recovery method, a variety of operational parameters and environmental variables were tested, such as mixing speed, mixing time, initial concentrations of BDE-209, salinity contents of sediment, and fractions of humic acids. A biodegradation experiment with different humic acid contents and with or without residual emulsion was conducted to compare the biodegradation rates under different conditions. All samples were extracted by using accelerated solvent extraction and detected by a gas chromatography with an electron capture detector. Results and discussion: In this study, we used an emulsion to recover BDE-209 in simulated sediment samples with different salinity and humic acid contents. BDE-209 was recovered as much as 96.10 % in a single recovery operation under a condition similar to the real situation of Er-Ren River in Taiwan. The biodegradation of unrecovered BDE-209 was assessed under anaerobic conditions with residual emulsion as an electron donor. The average half-life is 11.7 ± 1.9 days with residual emulsion, which is about 40 % shorter than that of those without emulsion and much shorter than those reported in literature. Real sediment samples were also tested and the result indicated that this method is highly feasible. Conclusions: Emulsion-enhanced recovery and biodegradation could be a highly feasible way to remove BDE-209 in river sediments. This method is not sensitive to the initial concentration of BDE-209 but sensitive to the salinity and humic acid concentration in sediments. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Department of Environmental Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, No. 250, Kuo-Kuang Road, Taichung, 40227, Taiwan",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,6,1.0,,"Chang, S.-C.; Department of Environmental Engineering, No. 250, Kuo-Kuang Road, Taiwan; 電子郵件: shuchichang@nchu.edu.tw","Environmental Protection Administration, Executive Yuan, R.O.C.

2018.0,J. Soils Sed.,Levels and sources of heavy metals in soil sediment and food crop in the vicinity of electric arc furnace EAF steelmaking plant a case study from Taiwan,Lin Y;Lee W;Shih Y;Jhang S;Chien S,"Purpose: The distribution and characteristics of heavy metals around an electric arc furnace (EAF) plant in Taichung City, Taiwan, were investigated. The aim of this research was to predict the main steelmaking processes causing contamination of As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, and Zn in the environment. Materials and methods: Food crop, surface water, sediments, and soils were collected from a total of 65 and 53 sampling sites during November 2011 and June 2012, thus establishing the basic environmental information. The heavy metals in samples were assessed by potential ecological risk indices. The correlation between the source and receptors of contamination was evaluated through the statistical significance of isotope approach and hierarchical cluster analysis. Results and discussion: The heavy metal contamination was mainly from the storage facility of waste iron and the discharging device of fly ash in the EAF plant. Surface runoff and rainwash were the two potential routes distributing the metallurgical Cd and Pb to the surrounding environment. Based on the mathematical simulation of dispersion modeling, the impact of heavy metals through the two specific flue gases on the farmland was insignificant; the particulate matter (PM), SO2, and NOx were concentrated southward in the atmosphere, and they were 1.71 μg—PM/Nm3, 2.80 ppb—SO2, and 1.87 ppb—NOx, respectively. Conclusions: Because of topographical features, the contaminated sediment produced by steelmaking activities is washed into downstream via surface runoff, which is supposed to be the major source of long-term accumulation of heavy metals in the environments, although the contamination with heavy metals was graded as low. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Institute of Environmental Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, 804, Taiwan; Center for Emerging Contaminants Research, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, 804, Taiwan; Research Center for Environmental Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, 807, Taiwan; Department of Environmental Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, 701, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,5,1.0,,"Shih, Y.-J.; Institute of Environmental Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: mcdyessjin@gmail.com",,NA NA NA NA,Dispersion modeling;  Electric arc furnace;  Fly ash;  Heavy metal;  Particulate matter,10.1007/s11368-018-1963-x,Article,agricultural land;  anthropogenic source;  dispersion;  environmental risk;  fly ash;  heavy metal;  isotopic analysis;  particulate matter;  research work;  sampling; Taichung;  Taiwan,Springer Verlag,Journal of Soils and Sediments,5,18,scopus,NATIONAL SUN YAT-SEN UNIVERSITY;NATIONAL SUN YAT-SEN UNIVERSITY;KAOHSIUNG MEDICAL UNIVERSITY;NATIONAL CHENG KUNG UNIVERSITY,INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING,A
2019.0,J. Soils Sed.,Assessment of exsitu chemical washing of heavy metals from estuarine sediments around an industrial harbor in Southern Taiwan,Shih Y;Syu S;Chen C;Chen C;Dong C,"Purpose: Harbor sediments normally accumulate the pollutants from municipal and industrial activities in the estuarine zone. This work aimed to characterize the fractionation change of heavy metals in harbor sediments before and after chemical washing. Since the annual dredging around the Kaohsiung Harbor has increased over time, the influence of ex-situ acid washing on sediment quality needs to be evaluated. Materials and methods: Experimental parameters of acid washing included the solid loading (4–20%) and types (HCl, HNO3, and citric acid) and concentrations (0.01–1 M) of acids. The fractionation of Cu, Zn, Ni, Cd, Cr, and Pb in the sediments at three estuaries, the Chienchen River, Canon River (Dock No.5), and Yanshui River, before and after washing processes were determined through sequential extraction. Results and discussion: The washing efficiencies of HCl, HNO3, and citric acid were similar, being 80.1–83.7%, 27.6–30.9%, 20.7–23.9%, and 97.2–98.8% for Zn, Ni, Cr, and Cd, respectively. After 15 min of washing, HCl was found as a suitable washing agent, and particularly, more effective for Cu (65.3%) and Pb (79.4%) than other acids. The extraction process suggested that the acid washing of carbonate, the Fe-Mn oxide composite, and organic phases were highly correlated to their quantities in the sediments. However, the removal efficiency was inversely related to the metals in the residual phase. Conclusions: Knowing the mobility and bioavailability of heavy metals based on fractionation of metals benefits the assessment of the potential risk of dredged harbor sediment after the washing procedure. This study provided evidence that acid washing, as a remediation method, could be versatile in removing heavy metals from mobile phases without causing mineralogical changes to the contaminated sediments of the harbor area. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Institute of Environmental Engineering, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, 804, Taiwan; Department of Marine Environmental Engineering, National Kaohsiung University of Science and Technology, Kaohsiung, 811, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,5,1.0,,"Dong, C.-D.; Department of Marine Environmental Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: cddong@webmail.nkmu.edu.tw","107-P07 National Sun Yat-sen UniversityNational Sun Yat-sen University, NSYSU","Funding information The authors would like to thank the National Sun Yat-sen University and National Kaohsiung University of Science and Technology, Taiwan, for financially supporting this research under Contract No. 107-P07.

1995.0,J. Southeast Asian Earth Sci.,DEVELOPMENT OF THE SHALE DIAPIRCONTROLLED FANGLIAO CANYON ON THE CONTINENTALSLOPE OFF SOUTHWESTERN TAIWAN,YU H;LU J,"Fangliao Canyon is one of several major canyons on the continental slope off southwestern Taiwan. This paper evaluates the canyon morphology and its formative processes and origin using multichannel seismic reflection profiles and bathymetric data. Fangliao Canyon is a small canyon around 10 km wide and 60 km long, an order of magnitude smaller than the large canyons of the world. This canyon can be divided into two morphologically contrasting parts: the upper canyon, a relatively straight part beginning at the shelf edge and ending approximately at the 600 m isobath, and the lower canyon, consisting of two segments separated by a rising linear ridge (shale diapir) and extending downslope to about the 1000 m isobath where its mouths lack submarine fans. Seismic profiles and bathymetric data provide evidence of submarine erosion forming the upper canyon and the uplift of a shale diapir controlling the formation of the lower canyon. In the upper canyon, truncation of parallel flat-lying strata and sliding/slumping features on the canyon walls are indicative of downcutting and lateral widening of the canyon. In the lower canyon, the shale diapir uplifted the slope strata and protruded through the overlying slope sediments, producing a ridge rising from the sea floor. Here the steep flanks of the shale diapir become the walls of the steep-sided canyons. The interaction of these sedimentary and tectonic processes on the continental slope off southwestern Taiwan forms the present Fangliao Canyon.",,,,TAIWAN,2,,1.0,"YU, HS (corresponding author), NATL TAIWAN UNIV,INST OCEANOG,DIV MARINE GEOL & GEOPHYS,TAIPEI 10018,TAIWAN.",,,,,Article,EVOLUTION,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,JOURNAL OF SOUTHEAST ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES,26,11,ISI,,NATL TAIWAN UNIV,B2
1995.0,J. Southeast Asian Earth Sci.,FISSIONTRACK DATING OF VOLCANICS IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE TAIWANLUZON ARC ERUPTION AGES AND EVIDENCE FOR CRUSTAL CONTAMINATION,YANG T;TIEN J;CHEN C;LEE T;PUNONGBAYAN R,"Igneous rocks from the Coastal Range and offshore islets of eastern Taiwan, Camiguin island and northern Luzon of the Philippines, which collectively constitute the northern part of the Taiwan-Luzon Are, have been dated by the fission-track technique. The pooled ages range widely from 49.9 Ma to 0.02 Ma. Some of the samples produce bimodal or even multiple age distributions in composite probability density plots, indicating the presence of inherited ''ages'' in the dated zircons. A chi(2) test shows that most of the chi(2) ages are in good agreement with the youngest peak date. Except for one intrusive basement sample and five volcanic samples affected by hydrothermal alteration, most of the chi(2) ages can be interpreted as the ages of volcanic eruptions. The inherited ages of the zircon populations present in many samples record thermal activities which occurred prior to the eruption of their host magmas. This suggests that upper level crustal contamination has taken place, thereby introducing some xenocrystic zircons into the magmas erupted. The fission-track ages are always younger than or occasionally equal to the ages obtained by other methods for the samples from the same localities. Of six samples dated by the Ar-Ar stepwise heating method four samples have plateau age close to the FTD ages. Some samples do not contain inherited, partially annealed FTD ages and the corresponding K-Ar ages are consistent with the FTD ages. A detailed study of Rb/Sr isotopic systematics of phenocryst minerals by Lan C. Y., Shen J. J. S. and Lee T. (1986). A Rb-Sr isotopic study of andesites from Lutao, Lanhsu, and Hsiao-Lanhsu, eruption ages and isotopic heterogeneity. Bull. Inst. Earth Sci. 6, 211-226 showed isotopic disequilibrium suggesting retention of unequilibrated older volcanic products. Many of the K-Ar dates, which are commonly older than the eruption ages determined by the FTD technique, may reflect inherited argon. Based on results from a combination of dating methods, volcanism in the northern part of the Taiwan-Luzon Are can be deduced to have been active since 26 Ma. The igneous activity in the Taiwan Segment (northern part of North Luzon Are as exposed in the Coastal Range) ceased at 2.2 Ma, because of the are-continent collision. Further southward, away from the present location of the collision zone, the volcanoes are still active.","WOODS HOLE OCEANOG INST,DEPT MARINE CHEM & GEOCHEM,WOODS HOLE,MA 02543.; ACAD SINICA,INST EARTH SCI,TAIPEI 115,TAIWAN.; PHILIPPINE INST VOLCANOL & SEISMOL,QUEZON,PHILIPPINES.;",TAIWAN;PHILIPPINES,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,5,1.0,1.0,"YANG, TF (corresponding author), NATL TAIWAN UNIV,DEPT GEOL,TAIPEI 10764,TAIWAN.",,,,10.1016/0743-9547(94)00041-C,Article,ISOTOPIC EVIDENCE; RECENT ENRICHMENT; ISLAND-ARC; PHILIPPINES; ZIRCON; GEOCHEMISTRY; CALIBRATION; COMPONENT; SR; GEOCHRONOLOGY,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,JOURNAL OF SOUTHEAST ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES,46,11,ISI,WOODS HOLE OCEANOG INST;INST EARTH SCI;PHILIPPINE INST VOLCANOL AND SEISMOL,NATL TAIWAN UNIV,B2

In Taiwan, three igneous provinces, namely, Western, Eastern and Northern, respectively (in order of the initiation of volcanic activities), can be distinguished. The Western Province comprises intraplate basalts, erupted in the rifted continental margin of southeastern China; whereas the Eastern and Northern Provinces are composed of are volcanics genetically related to the Luzon and the Ryukyu subduction zones, respectively. These volcanic rocks were sequentially emplaced on the island of Taiwan as a result of the collision between the Luzon are and the Asian continent since about 12 Ma. This collision, likewise, induced westward migration of the Ryukyu Trench system and subsequent opening of the Okinawa Trough. As a consequence, the collision-derived compression diminished in northern Taiwan. A post-collisional extension regime thus formed has generated some recent volcanic rocks in this region.","UNIV RENNES 1,F-35042 RENNES,FRANCE.;",FRANCE,FRANCE,TAIWAN,4,,1.0,"CHUNG, SL (corresponding author), NATL TAIWAN UNIV,DEPT GEOL,245 CHOUSHAN RD,TAIPEI 10764,TAIWAN.",,,,10.1016/0743-9547(94)00040-L,Article,TRACE-ELEMENT EVIDENCE; TECTONIC EVOLUTION; ISOTOPIC EVIDENCE; MANTLE COMPONENT; PHILIPPINE SEA; ARC; COLLISION; INDONESIA; OPHIOLITE; ORIGIN,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,JOURNAL OF SOUTHEAST ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES,22,11,ISI,,NATL TAIWAN UNIV,B1

The buoyancy of the relatively young and warm crust of the ridge system may be responsible for the high elevation of the NLS. Volcanism in this part of the are is characterized by the eruption of small volumes of intermediate to felsic magma (57-65% SiO2). The eruption products from the volcanic front in the central part of the Cordillera form. a low-K, calc-alkaline suite, characterized by high Sr and low HREE and Y contents. Some workers consider these characteristics to be the geochemical fingerprints of magmas generated by slab-melting. However, model calculations require the amount of residual garnet in the source to be small (less than or equal to 10%), in contrast to experimental work that indicates high amounts of residual garnet (greater than or equal to 30%). Alternatively, the melts may have been generated by melting of amphibolitic lower crust. The magmas erupted in the eastern and southern parts of the segment are calc-alkaline suites with moderate to high K contents and Sr and Y contents typical for are suites. The small volume and evolved composition of the erupted magmas may be related to the uplift of the NLS with the crust acting as a density filter, which prevents more mafic magmas from reaching the surface.","UNIV MELBOURNE,DEPT GEOL,PARKVILLE,VIC 3052,AUSTRALIA.; MONASH UNIV,DEPT EARTH SCI,CLAYTON,VIC 3168,AUSTRALIA.; INST MINERAL & LAGERSTATTENLEHRE,W-5100 AACHEN,GERMANY.; NATL TAIWAN UNIV,DEPT GEOL,TAIPEI 10770,TAIWAN.; LA TROBE UNIV,DEPT GEOL,BUNDOORA,VIC 3083,AUSTRALIA.;",AUSTRALIA;AUSTRALIA;GERMANY;TAIWAN;AUSTRALIA,AUSTRALIA,,5,4.0,,,,,,10.1016/0743-9547(94)00039-H,Article,SOUTH CHINA SEA; ISLAND-ARC; ISOTOPIC EVIDENCE; ARCHEAN TRONDHJEMITES; TECTONIC EVOLUTION; RECENT ENRICHMENT; MANILA TRENCH; GEOCHEMISTRY; TRACE; ORIGIN,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,JOURNAL OF SOUTHEAST ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES,7,11,ISI,,,A
1996.0,J. Southeast Asian Earth Sci.,Lead210 and plutonium fallout in Taiwan as recorded at a subalpine lake,Huh C;Chu K;Wei C;Liew P,"A sediment core collected from the Sun Moon Lake in middle Taiwan was investigated for Pb-210 and Pu-239,Pu-240. Based on the decrease of excess Pb-210 With depth, the mean sedimentation rate in the lake during the past half century is about 0.9 cm yr(-1), which is unequivocally supported by the appearance of the 1963 plutonium fallout maximum at 26-28 cm. The short-term sedimentation rate is one order of magnitude greater than C-14-based long-term sedimentation rates in the lake reported previously. This may be attributed to the deterioration of soil conservation associated with the construction of a dam five decades ago. Total downcore inventories of excess Pb-210 and Pu-239,Pu-240 are 54.5 dpm cm(-2) and 0.21 dpm cm(-2), respectively. This Pb-210 inventory requires a flux of 1.7 dpm cm(-2) yr(-1) at steady state, which is similar to Pb-210 fluxes observed at other sites in the western Pacific rim. The inventory of Pu-239,Pu-240 is in excellent agreement with documented cumulative Pu-239,Pu-240 from global fallout (0.96 +/- 0.07 mCi km(-2)) at the 20-30 degrees N latitudinal band. Our data suggest that the Sun Moon Lake is an ideal setting for monitoring atmospheric fallout and environmental changes in this region. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

1996.0,J. Southeast Asian Earth Sci.,Subductionrelated granitic rocks of Taiwan,Lan C;Jahn B;Mertzman S;Wu T,"Late Cretaceous granitic rocks constitute an essential part of the pre-Tertiary Tananao metamorphic basement complex of Taiwan. They are dominantly of granodiorite to quartz monzonite composition. Most granitic rocks are peraluminous (A/CNK > 1.0 and normative corundum > 1%) and display moderately fractionated LREE and relatively unfractionated HREE patterns with negative Eu anomalies. On a primitive mantle-normalized trace-element diagram, they show a significant Nb depletion which is typical of the calc-alkaline magmatism from the subduction-zone environment. They fall within the volcanic are field on the discrimination diagram of Pearce, Harris and Tindle (1984). The lack of systematic inter-element relationships suggests that the role of fractional crystallization is not significant and that these granitic rocks were derived from heterogeneous protoliths. Geochemical data suggest Taiwan granitic rocks are contaminated I-type and I-type granites related to the subduction of the Paleo-Pacific plate beneath the eastern margin of the Eurasia plate during late Mesozoic time.

2002.0,J. Struct. Geol.,Geometry and structure of northern surface ruptures of the 1999 Mw 76 ChiChi Taiwan earthquake Influence from inherited fold belt structures,Lee J;Chu H;Angelier J;Chan Y;Hu J;Lu C;Rau R,"Surface ruptures associated with the 1999 Mw = 7.6 Chi-Chi earthquake in central western Taiwan have been characterised by mapping along the northern fault-segment. The earthquake occured on the reactivated Chelungpu fault in the frontal portion of the thin-skinned Taiwan fold-and-thrust belt. The N-S trending Chelungpu fault is a 90-km-long major west-verging thrust, which principally slips within, and parallel to, bedding of the Pliocene Chinshui Shale. In the northern segment of the earthquake fault trace, that we name the Shihkang-Shangchi fault zone, the surface ruptures turn to an E-W strike and produce a series of thrust-and-backthrust pop-ups, about 15 km long, forming several discontinuous subsegments distributed within a broad regional Pliocene syncline. The northern fault segments activated during the Chi-Chi earthquake, in the area where the displacement is largest, not only display anomalous trends and a variety of mechanisms, but also raise a major problem of structural inheritance. Detailed field investigation and kinematic analysis indicate that the surface ruptures in the Shihkang-Shangchi fault zone are the result of dip-slip thrusting, occasionally with a minor strike-slip component. The surface ruptures emerge at the surface from bedding-parallel thrusts on both limbs of the regional south-plunging syncline. In the middle part of the syncline, bedding-parallel thrusts are connected by thrusts that cross-cut beds. The surface ruptures also reactivate a NE-SW trending anticline (Diaoshenshan), with west-vergent thrust on the backlimb and east-vergent backthrust on the forelimb. This anticline is undergoing uplift by breaking through the regional N-S trending syncline. Combining GPS measurements, seismological data, and geological analyses, we propose a kinematic model with a 3-D fault surface for the 1999 earthquake in the area of the northern termination. We highlight the influence of both the local and regional structures (bedding parallel slip, pre-existing faults and folds) on the development of the earthquake rupture, and hence the role of the structural inheritance. We conclude that the south-plunging regional Pliocene syncline in fact acts as a slip/strain guide for the northern termination of the Chelungpu thrust. The Pliocene Chinshui Shale, as a major source of weakness within the syncline, has strongly influenced the pattern of slip surface during the 1999 earthquake rupture. We interpret the large vertical displacement along the northern segment as the fault rupture occuring over a surface whose radius of curvature tightens toward the north around the core of the syncline. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The N-S striking fault dips 30degreesE and is reverse, almost dip-slip. It accounts for about one half of the total NW-SE shortening of the whole fault zone. The remaining deformation occurred inside the upthrust block, in a damaged zone less than 3 km wide, and is dominated by N-S left-lateral shear. This distribution of co-seismic deformation highlights fault slip partitioning along an oblique fault zone, at a depth shallower than 1.7 km. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Geol.,Slip vectors of the surface rupture of the 1999 ChiChi earthquake western Taiwan,Lee Y;Hsieh M;Lu S;Shih T;Wu W;Sugiyama Y;Azuma T;Kariya Y,"About 100 slip vectors were surveyed along the 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake rupture (100 km long), western Taiwan, to understand the coseismic reverse-faulting processes. The surveyed slip azimuths vary locally (over 80degrees) where the rupture is irregular or associated with flexure. Even where the rupture is straight and has consistent slip azimuths, the fault-scarp heights, horizontal slips and fault dip-angles oscillate in a distance of hundreds of meters along the rupture. Despite these local variations, the net slip (up to 11.5 m), vertical and horizontal slips are significant greater in the north, on which maximum shortening (6 m; by pure thrust) and strike slip (8 m; by left-lateral fault) occur in association with the bend of the rupture. The slip azimuths also progressively rotate from north/northwest in the north to west/southwest in the south. These patterns generally agree with those revealed by GPS surveys, except that the slips by GPS in the south move to the west/northwest and have values unexpectedly smaller than our measurements. Our obtained SW-directed slips resulted in dominantly right-lateral faulting (up to 2.4 m) where the rupture ends to the southeast. This, however, does not correspond to focal mechanisms of any main shocks or aftershocks. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

2003.0,J. Struct. Geol.,Threedimensional deformation along the rupture trace of the September 21st 1999 Taiwan earthquake a case study in the Kuangfu school,Angelier J;Lee J;Hu J;Chu H,"In Central Taiwan, the destructive Chichi earthquake (M-w=7.6) of September 21st, 1999, produced a nearly 100-km-long rupture trace following the Chelungpu Fault. This paper shows how the geometry of the fault slip can locally be determined in three dimensions, based on analyses of earthquake fault in the Kuangfu stadium. The fault at this site is reverse and left-lateral. The three-dimensional geometrical analysis, done with a variety of data through independent determination modes, all applied to the deformation of the surface layer of the stadium tracks, allows complete verification of the results. Not only do these analyses constrain the fault behaviour in terms of trend, dip angle, obliquity and amount of slip, but also they reveal variations in both the horizontal and the vertical fault geometry. The comparison with relative displacements recorded at larger distances from the fault reveals that slip partitioning occurs, with nearly dip-slip thrusting along the rupture trace and distributed left-lateral shear in a deformed zone of the hanging wall, adjacent to the main fault.

The main surface break and large slip (3-10 m) is on two segments of the shallow otherwise aseismic bedding-parallel Chelungpu-Sanyi thrust system, which shows nearly classic ramp-flat geometry with shallow detachments (1-6 km) in the Pliocene Chinshui Shale and Mio-Pliocene Kueichulin/Tungkeng Formations. However, rupture is complex, involving at least six faults, including a previously unknown deeper thrust (8-10 km) on which the rupture began. We compare the coseismic displacements with a new 3D map of the Chelungpu-Sanyi system. The displacements are spatially and temporally heterogeneous and well correlated with discrete geometric segments of the 3D shape of the fault system. Geodetic displacement vectors are statistically parallel to the nearest adjacent fault segment and are parallel to large-scale oblique fault corrugations. The displacement magnitudes are heterogeneous at several scales, which requires in the long term other non-Chi-Chi events or significant aseismic deformation.

2007.0,J. Struct. Geol.,Inference of trishearfaulting processes from deformed pregrowth and growth strata,Lin M;Wang C;Chen W;Yang C;Jeng F,"Near surface strata deformed by propagation of a fault situated underneath these strata hold explicit records of fault activities. The delicate deformed strata exposed in investigation trenches for paleoseismologic study conform to fault-propagation folds growing above a blind thrust. Growth strata deposited subsequently across the coseismic fold scarps are preserved by onlap and unconformities. Information from these sedimentary and folding processes was used in conjunction with inverse modeling using the trishear model technique proposed by Allmendinger (Allmendinger, R.W., 1998. Inverse and forward numerical modeling of trishear fault-propagation folds. Tectonics 17, 640-656) in estimating the times and amounts of slips. This methodology becomes necessary especially when the extent of a deformed profile is insufficiently exposed to observation or the location of the fault tip is invisible. The proposed method can deal with growth strata that can be selectively removed during fold restoration. The interpretations on the deformation history obtained by inverse analysis and trench investigation were then compared. The combination of these two approaches seemed to enhance and complement each other and allows a better and more complete understanding of the trishear-faulting processes and is useful in seismic hazard assessment.

Geol.,Anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility and Pwave velocity in core samples from the Taiwan ChelungpuFault Drilling Project TCDP,Louis L;Chen T;David C;Robion P;Wong T;Song S,"The anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) and anisotropy of P-wave velocity (APV) were characterized in core samples retrieved from the TCDP Hole A at depths ranging from 600m to 1400m, thus cutting across the thrust fault that ruptured during the 1999 Chi-chi earthquake. Our data show that the AMS was similar for all the samples regardless of the lithologic contrasts, with a magnetic fabric characteristic of weakly deformed sedimentary rocks that had undergone layer parallel shortening. This robust observation applies to both the siltstones and sandstones at all depths investigated. In contrast the APV data reflect fundamental differences between the elastic fabrics in the two facies. While APV of the siltstone samples is controlled by a preferred orientation of the matrix minerals, the APV of the sandstones is greatly influenced by microcrack porosity with a preferred orientation parallel to the maximum principal direction of paleostress and tectonic deformation. These AMS and APV data obtained in TCDP Hole A at locations not directly impacted by the coseismic rupture provide a first order petrofabric framework for the characterization of hydromechanical anisotropy in the Chelungpu fault system.

Part of the northern segment near the Fengyuan City provides an excellent opportunity for characterizing active thrust-related structures due to a dense geodetic-benchmark network. We reproduced co-seismic deformation patterns of a small segment of this Chelungpu Fault using 924 geodetic benchmarks. According to the estimated displacement vectors, we identified secondary deformations, such as local rigid-block rotation and significant shortening within the hanging wall. The data set also allows us to determine accurately a 3D model of the thrust fault geometry in the shallow subsurface by assuming simple relations between the fault slip, and the horizontal and vertical displacements at the surface. The predicted thrust geometry is in good agreement with borehole data derived from two drilling sites close to the study area.

2011.0,J. Struct. Geol.,Structure and Holocene evolution of an active creeping thrust fault The Chihshang fault at Chinyuan Taiwan,Mu C;Angelier J;Lee J;Chu H;Dong J,"We conducted a variety of measurements and analyses at Chihshang Active Fault Observatory in eastern Taiwan, including surface-rupture mapping, three shallow borehole core analysis and kinematic analysis of geodetic measurements. We found that the Chihshang fault exhibits a three-branch fault system in the Chinyuan alluvial fan, which is composed of at least 100 m thick gravel deposits. Outside of the Chinyuan River, the Chihshang fault shows a single fault system with a sharp lithological contact. Combining the leveling results and trench excavation, we interpret that the three fault branches are coupled with a 50-60-m-wide pop-up structure in the hangingwall. Based on the ratio between vertical and horizontal displacements, we obtained dip angles of 38 degrees, 62 degrees and 16 degrees for two west-vergent thrusts and an east-vergent backthrust, respectively. This pop-up was estimated to develop at the uppermost 30-40 m unconsolidated gravels during the last few thousand years above the main fault with a dip angle of 42 degrees. By compiling the available ages data, we obtained an uplift rate of 2.3 cm/yr of the Chihshang fault and an alluvial sedimentation rate of 1.1 cm/yr during the past thousands years. Consequently, the individual uplift rate for each fault branch at the Chihshang Observatory was slightly less than the deposition rate of the Chinyuan River. No geomorphic fault scarp can thus be observed in the three-branch fault system area. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

2014.0,J. Struct. Geol.,Faulting processes in active faults Evidences from TCDP and SAFOD drill core samples,Janssen C;Wirth R;Wenk H;Morales L;Naumann R;Kienast M;Song S;Dresen G,"The microstructures, mineralogy and chemistry of representative samples collected from the cores of the San Andreas Fault drill hole (SAFOD) and the Taiwan Chelungpu-Fault Drilling project (TCDP) have been studied using optical microscopy, TEM, SEM, XRD and XRF analyses. SAFOD samples provide a transect across undeformed host rock, the fault damage zone and currently active deforming zones of the San Andreas Fault. TCDP samples are retrieved from the principal slip zone (PSZ) and from the surrounding damage zone of the Chelungpu Fault. Substantial differences exist in the clay mineralogy of SAFOD and TCDP fault gouge samples. Amorphous material has been observed in SAFOD as well as TCDP samples. In line with previous publications, we propose that melt, observed in TCDP black gouge samples, was produced by seismic slip (melt origin) whereas amorphous material in SAFOD samples was formed by comminution of grains (crush origin) rather than by melting. Dauphine twins in quartz grains of SAFOD and TCDP samples may indicate high seismic stress. The differences in the crystallographic preferred orientation of calcite between SAFOD and TCDP samples are significant. Microstructures resulting from dissolution precipitation processes were observed in both faults but are more frequently found in SAFOD samples than in TCDP fault rocks. As already described for many other fault zones clay-gouge fabrics are quite weak in SAFOD and TCDP samples. Clay-clast aggregates (CCAs), proposed to indicate frictional heating and thermal pressurization, occur in material taken from the PSZ of the Chelungpu Fault, as well as within and outside of the SAFOD deforming zones, indicating that these microstructures were formed over a wide range of slip rates.

2014.0,J. Struct. Geol.,Regional porefluid pressures in the active western Taiwan thrust belt A test of the classic HubbertRubey faultweakening hypothesis,Yue L;Suppe J,"We document regional pore-fluid pressures in the active Taiwan thrust belt using 55 deep boreholes to test the classic Hubbert-Rubey hypothesis that high static fluid pressures (depth normalized as lambda = P-f/(rho) over bar (r)gz) account for the extreme weakness of thrust faults, since effective friction mu(f)* = mu(f)(1 - lambda). Taiwan fluid pressures are dominated by disequilibrium compaction, showing fully compacted sediments with hydrostatic fluid pressures at shallow depths until the fluid-retention depth z(FRD) approximate to 3 km, below which sediments are increasingly undercompacted and overpressured. The Hubbert-Rubey fault weakening coefficient is a simple function of depth (1 - lambda) approximate to 0.6z(FRD)/z. We map present-day and pre-erosion fluid pressures and weakening (1 - lambda) regionally and show that active thrusts are too shallow relative to z(FRD) for the classic Hubbert-Rubey mechanism to be important, which requires z >= similar to 4z(FRD) approximate to 12 km to have the required order-of-magnitude Hubbert-Rubey fault weakening of (1 - lambda) <= similar to 0.15. The best-characterized thrust is the Chelungpu fault that slipped in the 1999 (M-w = 7.6) Chi-Chi earthquake, which has a low effective friction mu(f)* approximate to 0.08-0.12, yet lies near the base of the hydrostatic zone at depths of 1-5 km with a modest Hubbert-Rubey weakening of (1 - lambda) approximate to 0.4-0.6. Overpressured Miocene and Oligocene detachments at 5-7 km depth have (1 - lambda) approximate to 0.3. Therefore, other mechanisms of fault weakening are required, such as the dynamical mechanisms documented for the Chi-Chi earthquake. (C) 2014 The Authors.

2014.0,J. Struct. Geol.,Structural analysis of a newly emerged accretionary prism along the JinlunTaimali coast southeastern Taiwan From subduction to arccontinent collision,Shan Y;Nie G;Ni Y;Chang C,"In southern Taiwan the initial collision of the Luzon volcanic arc with the passive continental margin of China results in the emergence of an accretionary prism of, predominantly, turbidites in composition, thus providing an appropriate place to study the temporal and spatial variation of deformation during the transition of subduction to arc-continent collision. Field surveys have recently been carried out in slightly metamorphosed rocks along the well-exposed Jinlun-Taimali coast in southeastern Taiwan. Three folding phases are identified in the area. The first phase is characterized by gently dipping but widely distributed phyllitic cleavage (S-1). The second phase is represented by sparsely distributed crenulation cleavage (S-2) that folded the phyllitic cleavage. The third phase is characterized by E-W trending anti-forms (F-3) that involved both types of pre-existing cleavages. Restoration of such an antiform in the north using a method proposed in this paper reveals that phyllitic cleavage in the overturned beds dips gently towards the southeast or east-southeast before the antiform, in relation to the first-phase thrusting or folding under regional ESE-WNW compression. From the first to third phase, the maximum horizontal compression underwent an about 90 degrees anticlockwise rotation from ESE-WNW to E-W or NE-SW to N-S, and the deformation depth seems to decrease drastically, in terms of the decreasing proportion of pervasive deformation. All these variations are attributed to the oblique arc-continent collision that exhumed the whole accretionary prism and induced a local stress perturbation in southeastern Taiwan.

With constraints on the time-temperature history from deposition through peak metamorphic state to exhumation, in-situ 40Ar/39Ar laser microprobe dating was carried out on muscovite and corrensite fibers of mm-scale mica porphyroblasts grown on a pressure-solution seam. Because the peak metamorphic temperature and the porphyroblast formation condition (∼250 °C) remained far below the closure temperature of the K-Ar radioisotope system in muscovite, and the absence of muscovite in the mafic protolith, the dating results likely document the growth of the mica porphyroblast fabrics.

2021.0,J. Struct. Geol.,Frictional strength and fluidization of watersaturated kaolinite gouges at seismic slip velocities,Kuo L;Wu W;Kuo C;Smith S;Lin W;Wu W;Huang Y,"Most previous experiments conducted on water-saturated clay-rich gouges sheared under extreme deformation conditions (including seismic slip rates e.g., 1 m/s, and displacements exceeding several meters) relied on gouge confinement using Polytetrafluoroethene (Teflon). Use of Teflon restricts such experiments to low normal stresses (<= 2 MPa), which represents a significant limitation in our understanding of earthquake physics and seismic hazard assessment. To understand how normal stress and fluid affect the frictional behavior and deformation processes of clay-rich slipping zones, we performed rotary shear experiments using a purpose-built sample holder on water-saturated kaolinite gouges at a slip rate of 1 m/s and normal stresses ranging from 2 to 18 MPa. Results show that the apparent friction coefficient, mu, increases up to a peak value, mu(p) of similar to 0.17-0.46, associated with marked gouge compaction. This is followed by dramatic weakening with increasing displacement to a steady-state value, mu(ss), similar to 0.02-0.26 accompanied by gouge dilation. In-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction and field-emission scanning electron microscopy show that clay aggregates within the gouge layer have a random fabric and do not experience mineral phase changes. On the basis of temperature measurements made during the experiments combined with a thermo-hydro-mechanical model, our results suggest that pore fluids within the gouge layer were mainly in liquid form during shearing. We conclude that dramatic weakening of kaolinite gouges at seismic rates under impermeable conditions is due to thermal pressurization, resulting in fluidization of the gouges. Our new experimental approach could be used to better understand earthquake physics and frictional processes of geological and civil interest.","Natl Cent Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Taoyuan, Taiwan.;  Natl Cent Univ, Earthquake Disaster Risk Evaluat & Management Ctr, Taoyuan, Taiwan.;  Natl Cent Univ, Ctr Adv Model Res Dev & Applicat, Taoyuan, Taiwan.;  Univ Otago, Dept Geol, Dunedin, New Zealand.;  Matsuki Hydraul Ind CO Ltd, Taoyuan, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;NEW ZEALAND;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,7,1.0,,"Kuo, LW (corresponding author), 300,JhongDa Rd, Taoyuan 32001, Taiwan.","Taiwan ROC (Republic of China) Ministry of Science and Technology [MOST 110-2116-M-008-002-MY2]; Earthquake-Disaster & Risk Evaluation and Management Center (E-DREaM) from The Featured Areas Research Center Program within the Ministry of Education (MOE), Taiwan; Marsden Fund of the Royal Society of New ZealandRoyal Society of New ZealandMarsden Fund (NZ) [UOO1829]","This research was financially supported by the Taiwan ROC (Re-public of China) Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST 110-2116-M-008-002-MY2) and Earthquake-Disaster & Risk Evaluation and Management Center (E-DREaM) from The Featured Areas Research Center Program within the framework of the Higher Education Sprout Project by the Ministry of Education (MOE) , Taiwan, to Li-Wei Kuo.

The positive rates in snails increased from 10.0 to 29.4% and the average number of larvae per snail increased from 11 to 40 as the size of snails increased from 1.0 to 4.0 cm height or more. In the seasonal fluctuation of snails in the field, positive snails could be examined every month; however, the positive rate in snails (28.2%) and the average number of larvae per snail (33) 8in the dry season (November to April) were significantly higher than those (15.2% and 23 respectively) in the rainy season (May to October). Ampullarium canaliculatus were confirmed naturally infected with A. cantonensis in this investigation so more attention should be paid to the snails to prevent the infection in humans.","Department of Parasitology, Kaohsiung Medical College, 100, Shih-Chuan 1st Road, Kaohsiung City, Taiwan",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,,"Yen, C.-M.; Dept. of Parasitology, 100 Shih-Chuan 1st Road, Kaohsiung City, Taiwan",,NA NA,,,Article,angiostrongylus;  animal experiment;  article;  ethnic or racial aspects;  invertebrate;  nematode;  nonhuman;  parasite vector;  priority journal;  taiwan; Angiostrongylus;  Animal;  Disease Vectors;  Nematode Infections;  Rain;  Rats;  Seasons;  Snails;  Taiwan; Ampullarium;  Angiostrongylus cantonensis;  Animalia;  Gastropoda;  Invertebrata,,Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene,21,93,scopus,KAOHSIUNG MEDICAL COLLEGE,NOTREPORTED,A
1994.0,J. TROP. MED. HYG.,Seroepidemiology of rubella virus infection among female residents on the offshore islets of Taiwan,Lin D;Chen C,"Although rubella vaccination was introduced in Taiwan in 1986 several outbreaks have occurred since then. In order to examine the epidemiological characteristics of rubella virus infection on the offshore islets of Taiwan, the Pescadore (Penghu) Islets and Orchid (Lan-Yu) Islet, the female residents of the islets aged 2-83 years were chosen as the study population. A community-based survey was carried out in three townships randomly selected through stratified sampling. Serum specimens of 677 healthy girls and women randomly sampled from the study areas were screened for the rubella antibody by a latex agglutination test and confirmed by a solid-phase immunoassay. A total of 415 subjects were antibody-positive giving a prevalence of 61.3%. The mean ± standard deviation of rubella IgG index was 2.84 ± 0.32. The seropositive rate increased with age in all three townships. The age pattern indicated that the regular ten-year rubella epidemic cycle ceased after 1978. A higher prevalence was observed in Orchid Islet than in the Pescadores. The overall seronegative rate was 48.7% (191/392) for females less than 20 years of age and 32.0% (48/150) for reproductive women between the ages of 20 and 35 years. With such a high proportion susceptible among females of child-bearing ages on the offshore islets of Taiwan, a mass rubella vaccination programme should be enforced in order to prevent possible outbreaks of congenital rubella syndrome in the future.","School of Medical Technology, Chung Shan Medical Dental College, 113 Sec 2 Taching Street, Taichung 402, Taiwan",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,,"Lin, D.-B.; School of Medical Technology, 113 Sec 2 Taching Street, Taichung 402, Taiwan",,NA NA,Offshore islets of Taiwan;  Rubella;  Seroepidemiology,,Article,immunoglobulin g;  rubella antibody;  rubella vaccine; adolescent;  adult;  aged;  article;  child;  congenital rubella syndrome;  female;  health survey;  human;  immunoassay;  infection sensitivity;  latex agglutination test;  major clinical study;  preschool child;  prevalence;  rubella;  rubella virus;  school child;  seroepidemiology;  taiwan; Adolescent;  Adult;  Age Factors;  Aged;  Aged; 80 and over;  Antibodies; Viral;  Child;  Child; Preschool;  Female;  Health Surveys;  Human;  Immunoassay;  Latex Fixation Tests;  Middle Age;  Population Surveillance;  Prevalence;  Rubella;  Rubella virus;  Seroepidemiologic Studies;  Support; Non-U.S. Gov't;  Taiwan;  Women's Health,,Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene,12,97,scopus,CHUNG SHAN MEDICAL DENTAL COLLEGE,SCHOOL OF MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY,A

Four hundred and sixteen (51%) pre-control mf carriers were examined physically with history taking. The rates of disappearance, improvement, no change, aggravation, and new occurrence were 72% (229), 6% (26), 14% (59), 6% (24) and 2% (8), respectively. The rates of disappearance and improvement were higher for the acute than for the chronic manifestations. However, these rates were also high for hydrocele and chyluria. These findings indicate that the acute manifestations disappear or greatly improve after filariasis eradication by a low dose of DEC medicated salt for a period of 6 months. However, the chronic ones remain unchanged or even aggravated to become one of the more important public health problems.","Department of Parasitology, School of Medicine, National Yangming University, Taipei, Taiwan",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,,"Fan, P.C.; Department of Parasitology, , Taipei, Taiwan",,NA NA,Clinical manifestations;  DEC medicated common salt;  Filariasis eradication;  Pre-control microfilarial carriers,,Article,diethylcarbamazine; adult;  aged;  article;  china;  chronic disease;  chyluria;  disease carrier;  female;  filariasis;  human;  hydrocele;  major clinical study;  male;  physical examination;  public health; Acute Disease;  Adult;  Aged;  Aged; 80 and over;  Animals;  Carrier State;  Chronic Disease;  Data Collection;  Diethylcarbamazine;  Drug Therapy; Combination;  Elephantiasis; Filarial;  Female;  Filaricides;  Follow-Up Studies;  Humans;  Male;  Middle Aged;  Sodium Chloride;  Taiwan;  Wuchereria bancrofti,,Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene,21,98,scopus,NATIONAL YANGMING UNIVERSITY,NOTREPORTED,A
1995.0,J. Volcanol. Geotherm. Res.,Magmatism at the onset of backarc basin spreading in the Okinawa Trough,Chen C;Lee T;Shieh Y;Chen C;Hsu W,"The Okinawa Trough is a back-are basin behind the Ryukyu Are in the western Pacific. Near its southwestern end is Kueishantao located, an volcanic islet offshore northeastern Taiwan. Kueishantao is the last volcanic center at the southernmost end of the Okinawa Trough's spreading axis. We report the isotopic (Nd, Sr, O) and chemical compositions of fresh andesites from Kueishantao. These rocks reveal extremely low Nd isotopic values (epsilon(Nd) = -1.9 to -5.2), very high Sr ratios (Sr-87/Sr-86>0.705) and high delta(18)O (between 7 and 8). Such a strong continental signature on Kueishantao can be explained by crustal contamination, most likely the magma resulting from a MORB-type magma assimilation with about 30% local continental crust materials (CC) and/or the thick overlying sediments during the onset of the ''rifting'' stage of the active back-are basin. Basalts and dacites, which were dredged from the spreading axis in the central part of the Okinawa Trough (Iheya Deep and Aguni Deep, I&A), exhibit high epsilon(Nd) values (2.3-4.7) and low delta(18)O values (<6.6) (Honma et al., 1991). This implies that less than 10% of continental crustal materials (CC) were involved in the magma generation. Based on the trace-element ratios (Nb/ Zr vs. Ba/Zr) of I&A basaltic rocks, it suggests that the formation of I&A magma needs not only two components (MORB-type magma and CC) but also an island-arc basalt (IAB) component. Since the spreading of the Okinawa Trough is believed to have propagated southwestwards in the last 2 Ma, we suggest that the magma from the southern tip segment (Kueishantao) may result from the onset of the ''rifting'' stage, while the magma from the central segment (I&A region) may be generated in the more mature segment stepping in ''drifting'' stage in the backarc basin.","NATL TAIWAN UNIV,INST GEOL,TAIPEI 10764,TAIWAN.; PURDUE UNIV,DEPT EARTH & ATMOSPHER SCI,W LAFAYETTE,IN 47907.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,5,1.0,1.0,"Chen, CH (corresponding author), ACAD SINICA,INST EARTH SCI,POB 1-55,TAIPEI 115,TAIWAN.",,,,10.1016/0377-0273(95)00028-3,Article,NORTHERN MARIANA-ISLANDS; ND ISOTOPIC EVIDENCE; VOLCANIC-ROCKS; TRACE-ELEMENT; MARGINAL BASINS; WESTERN PACIFIC; LAU BASIN; SR; MANTLE; BASALTS,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH,54,69,ISI,NATL TAIWAN UNIV;PURDUE UNIV,INST EARTH SCI,B2
2007.0,J. Volcanol. Geotherm. Res.,Compositions and flux of soil gas in LiuHuangKu hydrothermal area northern Taiwan,Lan T;Yang T;Lee H;Chen Y;Chen C;Song S;Tsao S,"Soil CO2 flux has been considered a useful proxy to remotely monitor volcanic activity in a hydrothermal area within a safe distance. The Liu-Huang-Ku (LHK) area, which is close to the Taipei basin and many existing active fumaroles and hot springs, was chosen for the first systematic soil gas study in a hydrothermal area of Taiwan in 2004 and 2006. The soil Co-2 flux was measured by the closed-chamber method with a non-dispersive infrared detector. Soil CO2 emission rate was estimated 19.8 +/- 0.2 t day(-1) and 582 t km(-2) day(-1) in 2004, and 22.4 +/- 0.2 t day(-1) and 659 t km(-2) day(-1) in 2006, respectively. These values are close to those reported for other active high CO2 flux hydrothermal areas of the world. It implies that magmatic gases are actively degassing from subsurface in northern Taiwan. Helium and carbon isotopic data reveal that soil gas in LHK is mainly derived from the mantle and is mixed with a small amount of crustal and air components. The abundance Of Soil CO2 shows a positive correlation with the He-3/He-4 ratios and total sulfur contents, which are considered as magmatic-sensitive indicators for the fumarolic samples. Therefore, Soil CO2 could be used as a good proxy for future monitoring of magmatic activity in this area. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

2007.0,J. Volcanol. Geotherm. Res.,Seismicity characteristics of a potentially active Quaternary volcano The Tatun Volcano Group northern Taiwan,Konstantinou K;Lin C;Liang W,"The Tatun Volcano Group (TVG) is located at the northern tip of Taiwan, near the capital Taipei and close to two nuclear power plants. Because of lack of any activity in historical times it has been classified as an extinct volcano, even though more recent studies suggest that TVG might have been active during the last 20 ka. In May 2003 a seismic monitoring project at the TVG area was initiated by deploying eight three-component seismic stations some of them equipped with both short-period and broadband sensors. During the 18 months observation period local seismicity mainly consisted of high frequency earthquakes either occurring as isolated events, or as a continuous sequence in the form of spasmodic bursts. Mixed and low frequency events were also present during the same period, even though they occurred only rarely. Arrival times from events with clear P-/S-wave phases were inverted in order to obtain a minimum I D velocity model with station corrections. Probabilistic nonlinear earthquake locations were calculated for all these events using the newly derived velocity model. Most high frequency seismicity appeared to be concentrated near the areas of hydrothermal activity, forming tight clusters at depths shallower than 4 km. Relative locations, calculated using the double-difference method and utilising catalogue and cross-correlation differential traveltimes, showed insignificant differences when compared to the nonlinear probabilistic locations. In general, seismicity in the TVG area seems to be primarily driven by circulation of hydrothermal fluids as indicated by the occurrence of spasmodic bursts, mixed/low frequency events and a b-value (1.17 +/- 0.1) higher than in any other part of Taiwan. These observations, that are similar to those reported in other dormant Quaternary volcanoes, indicate that a magma chamber may still exist beneath TVG and that a future eruption or period of unrest should not be considered unlikely.

Res.,Fumarole compositions and mercury emissions from the Tatun Volcanic Field Taiwan Results from multicomponent gas analyser portable mercury spectrometer and direct sampling techniques,Witt M;Fischer T;Pyle D;Yang T;Zellmer G,"Gas emissions from Tatun volcanic group, northern Taiwan, were studied for the first time using a multicomponent gas analyser system (Multi-GAS) in combination with Giggenbach flask methods at fumaroles and mud pools at Da-you-keng (DYK) and Geng-tze-ping (GZP). CO2/S molar ratios observed at DYK ranged from 3-17, similar ratios were observed using a Multi-GAS sensor box of 8-16. SO2 at GZP was low, higher concentrations were observed at DYK where SO2/H2S ratios were close to 1 for both methods. A lower CO2/H2S ratio was measured via Giggenbach flask sampling (7.2) than was found in the plume using the gas sensor at GZP (9.2). This may reflect rapid oxidation of H2S as it mixes with background air. Gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) levels were observed in the fumarole gases using a portable mercury spectrometer. These are the first such measurements of mercury at Tatun. Mean GEM concentrations in the fumarole plumes were similar to 20 ng m(-3), with much higher concentrations observed close to the ground (mean [GEM] 130 and 290 ng m(-3) at DYK and GZP, respectively). The GEM in the fumarole plume was elevated above concentrations in industrial/urban air in northern Taiwan and the increase in GEM observed when the instrument was lowered suggests high levels of mercury are present in the surrounding ground surface. The GEM/CO2 (10(-8)) and GEM/S (10(-6)) ratios observed in the fumarole gases were comparable to those observed at other low-temperature fumaroles. Combining the Hg/CO2 ratio with a previous CO2 flux value for the area, the annual GEM flux from the Tatun field is estimated as 5-50 kg/year. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

2008.0,J. Volcanol. Geotherm. Res.,Magma mingling in the Tungho area Coastal Range of eastern Taiwan,Lai Y;Song S;Iizuka Y,"Complex rocks, consisting of different lithologic breccias and sediments in the Tungho area of the southern Coastal Range, eastern Taiwan, were formed by magmas and magma-sediment mingling. Based on field occurrences, petrography, and mineral and rock compositions, three components including mafic magma, felsic magma, and sediments can be identified. The black breccias and white breccias were consolidated from mafic and felsic magma, respectively. Isotopic composition shows these two magmas may be from the same source. Compared to the white breccias, the black breccias show clast-supported structures, higher An values in plagioclase, higher contents of MgO, CaO, and Fe2O3 and lower SiO2, greater enrichment in the light rare earth elements (LREE). and depletion in the heavy rare earth elements (HREE). The white breccias show matrix-supported blocks and mingling with tuffaceous sediments to form peperite. Physical and chemical evidence shows that the characteristics of these two components (mafic and felsic magmas) are still apparent in the mingled zone. According to their petrography, mafic and felsic magmas did not have much time for mingling. White intrusive structures and black flow structures show that mingling occurred before they solidified. Finally, the occurrence of mingling between magmas and sediments suggests that the mingling has taken place at the surface and not in the magma chamber. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

2008.0,J. Volcanol. Geotherm. Res.,Temporal variations of gas compositions of fumaroles in the Tatun Volcano Group northern Taiwan,Lee H;Yang T;Lan T;Chen C;Song S;Tsao S,"Hydrothermal activity is common in the Tatun Volcano Group of northern Taiwan. Helium isotopic compositions of fumarolic samples show that mantle component occupies more than 60% in the previous study. Along with recent seismic results, a magma reservoir is inferred to have existed beneath the area of Da-you-keng, where fumarolic venting is the most active in Tatun Volcano Group. Progressive increases of HCl concentrations and SO2/H2S ratio in fumaroles from Da-you-keng have been observed since August 2004. The HCl concentration changed from almost the detection limit to thousands of ppm, even up to 30,000 ppm. SO2/H2S ratios varied from almost 0 to 3; hence SO2 became the dominated S species in this area. These variations were accompanied by rising temperature of fumaroles in the Tatun Volcano Group, especially in the area of Da-you-keng (from boiling point to 131 degrees C). Meanwhile, He-3/He-4 ratios showed a decreasing trend but returned to normal values shortly thereafter. We propose two possible processes, 1) new magma supply and 2) recent opening of fractures in local area, to explain these observations. Based on the change of He-3/He-4 ratio and lack of ground deformation, we consider the latter might be more plausible. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

2009.0,J. Volcanol. Geotherm. Res.,Seismogenic stress field beneath the Tatun Volcano Group northern Taiwan,Konstantinou K;Lin C;Liang W;Chan Y,"The Tatun Volcano Group (TVG) represents the main volcanic center in northern Taiwan and based on various observations it is considered a potentially active volcano. TVG has been monitored since 2003 by a seismic network that consists of eight stations equipped with three-component, short-period and broadband seismometers. In this study, we use waveform data of high frequency earthquakes in order to investigate the stress field orientation beneath the TVG area. The focal mechanisms of 35 selected events have been derived using P-wave polarities and amplitude ratios, assuming a double-couple source. These fault plane solutions and various subsamples derived from them, were subsequently inverted for the best fitting stress tensor using a linear inversion method. The results show stress homogeneity beneath TVG for depths larger than 3 km while the stress tensor is characterized by a subvertical sigma(1) and a subhorizontal NW-SE trending sigma(3) axis consistent with the regional stress field in northern Taiwan. On the other hand, Chihsinshan which is an area of vigorous hydrothermal activity, exhibits a localized stress field with horizontal NW-SE trending sigma(3) axis and NE-SW trending horizontal sigma(1). Such an axes orientation is likely to be causing opening of microcracks and thus favour the ascent and circulation of fluids in the upper crust. Shear wave splitting measurements seem to confirm these results, showing fast polarization directions along NNE-NE, subparallel to the main fracture system in TVG. Shear wave anisotropy averages about 2.9% and is probably caused by an anisotropic volume of fluid-saturated cracks within the upper 2.5 km of the crust. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

2010.0,J. Volcanol. Geotherm. Res.,Deposits character and timing of recent eruptions and gravitational collapses in Tatun Volcanic Group Northern Taiwan Hazardrelated issues,Belousov A;Belousova M;Chen C;Zellmer G,"Taipei City, with a population of around 8 million, as well as two nuclear power plants is located in close proximity to the Quaternary, dominantly andesitic Tatun Volcanic Group (TVG) of Northern Taiwan. We have investigated the stratigraphy of the youngest volcaniclastic deposits, as well as the morphology of lava flows and domes of the TVG in order to reconstruct the character and timing of the most recent eruptions and related hazardous events in the area. Our data indicate that recent eruptions of the group were dominated by long-term, voluminous extrusions of crystal-rich, very viscous lavas. These eruptions formed closely spaced monogenetic domes and lava flows. Based on morphological parameters of the lava flows (thicknesses 80-150 m, lengths up to 5.6 km, and volumes up to 0.6 km(3)), average rates of magma effusion ranged from 1 to 10 m(3)/s, eruption durations from 500 to 1800 days, and lava front speeds from 0.5 to 6 m/h. Explosive activity of TVG was diverse, ranging from weak phreatic to highly explosive (VEI 4) Plinian eruptions; vulcanian activity with deposition of lithic ashes was most common. Interaction of rising magma with ground water frequently occurred during the eruptions. This study presents the first radiocarbon dates of various volcaniclastic deposits of the TVG, which indicate that Cising, Siaoguanyin, and possibly Huangzuei volcanoes had magmatic eruptions in the period 13,000-23,000 years ago. In addition, Mt. Cising had a phreatic eruption 6000 years ago, and possibly an effusive eruption just before that. Gravitational collapses of volcanic edifices with volumes 0.01-0.1 km(3) and H/L 0.16-0.25 were also common. They occurred on intersections with tectonic faults and may have been triggered by seismic activity. The youngest collapses occurred at Mt. Siaoguanyin (23,000 BP) and Mt. Cising (6000 BP). It is concluded that the TVG should be considered volcanically active. The results of this study provide a basis for volcanic hazard assessment and mitigation in the area. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

2014.0,J. Volcanol. Geotherm. Res.,Volcanohydrothermal activity detected by precise levelling surveys at the Tatun volcano group in Northern Taiwan during 20062013,Murase M;Lin C;Kimata F;Mori H;Pu H,"Precise levelling surveys were conducted from 2006 to 2013 on three levelling routes in the Tatun volcano group (TVG) located approximately 15 km northeast of Taipei, to detect deformation in relation to the volcano-hydrothermal activities of the TVG. Uplift was detected around the most active fumarole, Tayoukeng fumarole, throughout the period 2007 to 2011; the uplift rate throughout the period from March 2009 to March 2011 was reduced in comparison to the rate between 2007 and 2009. Following this, a dormant state or a small amount of subsidence was detected in the period March 2011 to March 2013. And throughout the period from June 2006 to March 2013, subsidence was centred on an area 0.5 km east of the summit of Mt. Cising, the highest peak in the TVG. A model of two spherical sources was therefore estimated from the deformation recorded from August 2007 to March 2011, using a genetic algorithm. A deflation source was obtained about 05 km northeast of Mt. Cising at a depth of 2 km; and an inflation source was situated approximately 1 km south of the Tayoukeng fumarole at a depth of 0.7 km. Based on previous seismic and AMT studies, the estimated sources are interpreted as being hydrothermal reservoirs. Because almost all the benchmarks around Mt. Cising show subsidence at a constant speed, we conclude that the deeper hydrothermal reservoir at a depth of 2 km may have been releasing hydrothermal fluid at a constant rate throughout the period from 2006 to 2013. However, it was suggested that in 2011 the shallower hydrothermal reservoir at a depth of 0.7 km changed from an inflation state to a dormant state (or small deflation) based on temporal vertical changes around Tayoukeng fumarole. A possible model for the volcano-hydrothermal system is therefore proposed. It is considered that the hydrothermal fluid may be supplied intermittently from the magma chamber to the deeper hydrothermal reservoir at a depth of 2 km (although this type of fluid input event may not have occurred during our research period), and that the hydrothermal fluid upwelling between Mt. Cising and Tayoukeng fumarole flows transversally into a highly cracked and fluid-saturated area that continues to Tayoukeng fumarole. The existence of a shallower hydrothermal reservoir at a depth of 0.7 km in the highly cracked and fluid-saturated area is therefore plausible. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

2015.0,J. Volcanol. Geotherm. Res.,He Ar N and C isotope compositions in Tatun Volcanic Group TVG Taiwan Evidence for an important contribution of pelagic carbonates in the magmatic source,Roulleau E;Sano Y;Takahata N;Yang F;Takahashi H,"The Tatun Volcanic Group (TVG), Northeastern Taiwan, is considered to be the extension of the Ryukyu arc, and belongs to the post-collisional collapse Okinawa Trough. Strong hydrothermal activity is concentrated along the Chinshan fault, and Da-you-keng (DYK) represents the main fumarolic area where the most primitive isotopic and chemical composition is observed. In this study, we present chemical and He, Ar, C and N isotopic compositions of fumaroles, bubbling gas and water from hot springs sampled in 2012 and 2013. High He-3/He-4 ratios from DYK fumaroles(approximate to 6.5 Ra) show a typical arc-like setting, whereas other sampling areas show a strong dependence of He-3/He-4 and CH4/He-3 ratios with the distance from the main active hydrothermal area (DYK). This could mean strong crustal contamination and thermal decomposition of organic matter from local sediments. Carbon isotope compositions of DYK range from -6.67%. to -5.85%., and indicate that carbon contribution comes mainly from pelagic carbonates from the slab (limestone, mantle and sediment contributions are 63%, 19% and 18%, respectively). This is consistent with the negative delta N-15 values (-1.4 +/- 0.5%.) observed for DYK, implying a strong nitrogen-mantle contribution, and an absence of contribution from nitrogen-pelagic carbonates. These results have important consequences related to the Ryukyu subducted slab. In fact, the Ryukyu margin presents little in off scraping the sedimentary cover to the subducting plate that does not permit any nitrogen contribution in magma from TVG. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

2016.0,J. Volcanol. Geotherm. Res.,Gravity monitoring of Tatun Volcanic Group activities and inference for underground fluid circulations,Mouyen M;Chao B;Hwang C;Hsieh W,"The Tatun Volcano Group (TVG), located on the northern coast of Taiwan adjacent to the city of Taipei, experiences active hydrothermalism but has no historical record of volcanic eruption. Yet recent studies suggest that TVG is dormant-active rather than extinct. To monitor mass transfers and to gain further understanding of this volcanic area, gravity variations have been recorded continuously since 2012 using a superconducting gravimeter, and once every few months since 2005 using absolute gravimeters. We analyze the continuous gravity time series and propose a model that best explains the gravity variations due to local groundwater redistribution. By correcting these variations, we identify gravity changes as large as 35 Gal that occurred concomitantly to fluid pressure-induced earthquakes and changes in the gas composition at Dayoukeng, one of TVG's fumaroles, over 2005-2007. We examine several fluid movements that can match the gravity observations, yet too few additional constraints exist to favor any of them. In particular, no significant ground displacements are observed when these gravity variations occurred. On the other hand, the model of gravity changes due to local groundwater redistribution can be routinely computed and removed from the ongoing time gravity measurements in order to quickly identify any unusual mass transfer occurring beneath TVG.

2016.0,J. Volcanol. Geotherm. Res.,Soil CO2 flux in hydrothermal areas of the Tatun Volcano Group Northern Taiwan,Wen H;Yang T;Lan T;Lee H;Lin C;Sano Y;Chen C,"We measured soil CO2 flux in the representative hydrothermal areas of the Tatun Volcano Group (TVG), to better understand the volcano's dynamic nature, and to estimate its soil CO2 degassing output. Results show that the average soil CO2 fluxes obtained at Da-You-Keng (DYK), Geng-Tze-Ping (GTP), She-Haung-Ping (SHP), and Tatun Natural Park (TNP) were 128 g m(-2)d(-1), 518 g m(-2)d(-1), 420 g m(-2)d(-1), and 25 g m(-2)d(-1), respectively. The range is comparable to other active volcanic/hydrothermal areas in the world. Along with Liu-Huang-Ku (LHK), where the soil CO2 flux is known, the total soil CO2 output from measured areas is evaluated at 82 t d(-1). Furthermore, a first total soil CO2 output from the whole hydrothermal areas of the TVG is roughly estimated at 113 t d(-1), which includes 15 t d(-1) mantle contribution. Considering the mantle-derived CO2 flux and H2O/CO2 ratio of fumarolic gas, thermal energy associated with the diffuse degassing at the TVG hydrothermal area is estimated at 8.2 MW. Carbon (delta C-13) and helium (He-3/He-4) isotopic ratios of soil samples of the studied areas ranged from -4.4 to -6.7 parts per thousand, and 2.45 to 6.98 R-A, respectively. The extent of air involvement in the soil degassing system, as constrained by the helium and carbon isotopic compositions, provides essential information for depicting regional degassing features of the hydrothermal areas.

2016.0,J. Volcanol. Geotherm. Res.,Verylongperiod seismic signals at the Tatun Volcano Group northern Taiwan,Lin C;Pu H,"Very-long-period (VLP) seismic events have been detected in the Tatun Volcano Group (TVG), located around the border between Taipei City and New Taipei City in northern Taiwan, in which has similar to 7 million residents. By using both analyses of particle motions and travel-time delay, one VLP volcanic earthquake's source is estimated to be at a shallow depth (similar to 800 m) beneath Mt. Chihsin, which is the highest and youngest volcano in the TVG. The significant variation of seismic energy at different azimuths provides strong evidence to distinguish a crack source from other kinds of sources, such as a sphere, vertical pipe or even double-couple source. This is further confirmed by synthetic modeling of the seismograms recorded at two stations as well as the compressional first-motion at three seismic stations. Thus, a deeper plumping system with high-pressure fluid is required to generate the VLP signals and other volcanic earthquakes in the TVG. Combining this result with those of previous studies, we conclude that the TVG might not be totally extinct and some further investigations must be carried out to improve understanding of the volcanic characteristics of the TVG.

2017.0,J. Volcanol. Geotherm. Res.,Shallow crustal velocities and volcanism suggested from ambient noise studies using a dense broadband seismic network in the Tatun Volcano Group of Taiwan,Huang Y;Lin C;Kagiyama T,"The Tatun Volcano Group (TVG) is situated adjacent to the Taipei metropolis and was active predominantly around 0.8-02 Ma (Pleistocene). Various recent lines of evidence suggest that the TVG is a potentially active volcano and that future volcanic eruptions cannot be ruled out. Geothermal activities are largely constrained to faults, but the relationship between volcanism and detailed velocity structures is not well understood. We analyzed ambient seismic noise of daily vertical components from 2014 using a dense seismic network of 40 broadband stations. We selected a 0.02 degrees grid spacing to construct 2D and 3D shallow crustal phase velocity maps in the 0.5-3 s period band. Two S-wave velocity.profiles transect Chishingshan (Mt. CS) in the shallow 3 km crust are further derived. The footwall of the Shanchiao Fault is dominated by low velocity, which may relate to Tertiary bedrock buried under andesitic lava flows dozens to hundreds of meters thick. The hanging wall of the Shanchiao Fault is the location of recent major volcanic activities. Low velocity zones in the southeast of Dayoukeng (DYK) may be interpreted as hydrothermal reservoirs or water-saturated Tertiary bedrock related to Cenozoic structures in the shallow crust. High velocities conspicuously dominate the east of the TVG, where the earliest stages of volcanism in the TVG are located, but where surface hydro-geothermal activities were absent in recent times. Between the Shanchiao Fault and Kanchiao Fault high velocities were detected, which converge below Mt. CS and may be related to early stages of magma conduits that gradually consolidated. These two faults may play a significant role with the TVG. The submarine volcanism adjacent to the Keelung coastline also requires further attention. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

2018.0,J. Volcanol. Geotherm. Res.,Gas discharges from the Kueishantao hydrothermal vents offshore northeast Taiwan Implications for drastic variations of magmatichydrothermal activities,Chen X;Lyu S;Zhang P;Yu M;Chen C;Chen Y;Li X;Jin A;Zhang H;Duan W;Ye Y,"The chemical compositions of gas discharges from the Kueishantao (KST) hydrothermal field changed dramatically from 2000 to 2014. In this study, we established a gas mixing model for the KST gases. The N-2, Ar, and CO2 contents were mixed from a magmatic endmember with CO2 of about 990 mmol/mol, a hydrothermal and an atmospheric endmember enriched in N-2 and Ar. More than 71% KST gas components were mantle-derived/magmatic The calculated endmember N-2/Ar ratio and Ar contents of the hydrothermal endmember (percolated fluid) are about 140 and 5.28-5.52 mmol/mol, respectively. This relatively elevated N-2/Ar ratio was probably caused by the thermogenic addition of N-2. The log(CH4/CO2) values of the KST gas samples correlate well with the mixing temperature that estimated from the mixing ratio between the percolated fluid and the magmatic endmember. It is indicated that the KST CH4 and CO2 may have attained chemical equilibrium. The temporal variations of the KST gas compositions are determined by the mixing ratio, which is dependent on the magmatic activity underneath the KST field. With the decreasing of magmatic activity since 2005, the proportion of the hydrothermal endmember increased, along with the increasing of N-2, Ar, and CH4 contents. This study proposed an effective model to quantitatively assess the sources of gas components discharged from submarine hydrothermal vents. In addition, it is suggested that the mixing between a magmatic and a hydrothermal endmember may play an important role in the concentrations of CO2 and CH4 in hydrothermal gas discharges.

Res.,A tidalinfluenced hydrothermal system temporarily cooled by a tropical storm,Chen X;Yu M;Loh P;Garbe-Schonberg D;Qiu Z;Schmidt M;Zhang H;Chen C;Zheng H;Ye Y,"The Lutao hydrothermal field is an intertidal arc volcanic system located offshore southeast Taiwan, hosting a Zhudanqu (ZDQ) vent and a Huwaichi (HWC) spring with strongly contrasting fluid chemistry. Low Mg, moderately enriched CI, and H+ with respect to seawater indicate that the ZDQ endmember was derived from the brine phase that was formed during low-degree subcritical phase separation. In contrast, the endmember for the HWC vent fluids is related to the vapor phase. Temperature and pressure of the phase separation were estimated as similar to 150 degrees C and similar to 7 bar, respectively. The water/rock ratio was roughly calculated as about 2. The Lutao hydrothermal system was slightly affected by semi-diurnal tides, by some combination of tidal loading and tidal currents. The time delay between tides and the response of the hydrothermal system was about 3 h. While freshwater was almost absent in the HWC vent fluids at normal conditions, the typhoon ""rung-wong"" on Sep 21st, 2014, led to intrusions of freshwater into the vent fluids with a percentage of similar to 16%. Both the ZDQ and the HWC endmember compositions showed some changes after the typhoon event, suggesting a cooling of the reaction zone. After the typhoon passed by, the hydrothermal system began to recover, evidenced by increasing percentages of the HWC endmember and decreasing freshwater contributions. The flux of the HWC endmember was estimated as 460-560 L h(-1) based on these observations. This study, for the first time, reports a shallow-depth tidal-influenced hydrothermal system that was temporarily cooled by a tropical storm. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Res.,Volcanohydrothermal inflation revealed through spatial variation in stress field in Tatun Volcano Group Northern Taiwan,Pu H;Lin C;Hsu Y;Lai Y;Shih M;Murase M;Chang L,"To investigate the inflation characteristics of subsurface volcano-hydrothermal activity, we examine the spatial variability of the stress field in the Tatun Volcano Group (TVG) of Northern Taiwan using 1016 earthquake focal mechanisms at depths shallower than 5 km from 2012 to 2017. We determine these focal mechanisms using the data from a dense seismic network composed of 40 seismic stations in an area of approximately 10 x 10 km(2) in the NG. We find that this area is subject to the northwest-southeast trended extension and subvertical compression. The stress magnitude ratios (empty set) near the Dayoukeng area are significantly lower than that in the other areas. This feature is likely related to an inflating source buried underneath the Dayoukeng area. Our model shows good agreement between the observed and predicted empty set values when the inflating pressure source located at a depth of approximately 2 km and with the average potency ranging from 1.4 x 10 (5) to 7 x 10(5) m(3) near the Dayoukeng area. We suggest that this inflation is associated with the local volcano-hydrothermal activity. This inflation is the principal pressure source in the shallow crust (<= 5 km at depth) in the TVG and may persist for at least a decade. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The pooled ages range widely from 49.9 Ma to 0.75 Ma. Some of the samples produce bi-modal or even poly-peaked composite probability density plots, indicating partial annealing effects, so the pooled ages cannot represent their eruption ages. Most of the χ2 ages (Brandon and Vance, 1991) are in good accord with the youngest peak date in the composite probability density plots. They range from 2.0 Ma to 0.54 Ma, and can be interpreted as the ages of volcanic eruptions. When compared with ""ages' derived from other radiometric dating methods, the FTD results always give the youngest age among them, but are close to the Ar-Ar plateau ages.

Fractal dimensions of topographic profiles and surfaces are estimated by variogram method. Six test sites were selected to perform the fractal analysis based on the DEM with resolution of 1 km and 40 m respectively. Significant results have been obtained by the fractal analysis of the DEM with resolution of 40 m, whereas the DEM sampled by a grid size of 1 km reflects nothing but the random nature of landforms. In different tectonic provinces, the fractal dimensions of topographic profiles and surfaces reveal distinct characteristics. The segmented fractal model of topographic surface is also confirmed in this study.

From an investigation of aerial photographs and geomorphology, the authors have identified seven levels of marine terraces that have developed on Lutao. Radiocarbon ages obtained from the carbonate samples veneered on top of the two lower marine terraces are 1 to 9 ka (Holocene) and 33 to 36 ka, respectively. It is believed that each level of marine terrace corresponds to one transgression-regression cycle, which is the result of interaction between crustal movement and sea level change.

Based on closure temperature calculations and the isotopic dates of the minerals, the thermal history of the area is derived as follows: the region experienced plutonism/metamorphism prior to 101 Ma, cooled rapidly in the initial stages at a rate of ~80°C/Ma between 101 and 97 Ma, and then cooled slowly to 180°C at a rate of ~8°C/Ma until ~82 Ma.

In the stage of weak oxidation, titanomagnetites exsolve three sets of well-oriented ilmenite lamellae of the first generation.

The lamellar ilmenites of both generations are further oxidized to rutile and hematite. In the stage of strong oxidation, rutile and hematite in the altered ilmenite lamellae react to form pseudobrookites, while patchy pseudobrookites might also be formed from the matrix which consists of titanomagnetite and hematite in this stage of oxidation. Overall, the present study has found that the behavior of titanomagnetites in response to oxidation at high temperatures is controlled by their TiO2 contents, the rate of cooling of the magmas and rocks, the rate of oxidation, and oxygen fugacity. -from Authors","Dept of Earth Sci, National Cheng Kung Univ, Tainan, Taiwan, ROC, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,,2,1.0,,,,NA NA,,,Article,exsolution;  oxidation;  texture;  titanomagnetite; Coastal Range;  Taiwan,,Journal - Geological Society of China,0,37,scopus,,,X

This Taiwan-endemic subspecies occurs in a relic pattern within a short extension of mountain-ridge between 1350 and 2000 m alt. around 24°40′ N. However, fossil beech pollen was found to have been an important forest element in low-lying lake and basin deposits in northern Taiwan and in deltaic sediments as far south as about 23°30′ N in central Taiwan during the middle Pleistocene.

1990.0,Journal of Southeast Asian Earth Sciences,Geochemistry and platetectonic significance of the metabasites from the Tananao Schist Complex of Taiwan,Yui T;Wu T;Jahn B,"The pre-Tertiary Tananao Schist Complex of Taiwan forms the basement rocks on which younger rocks are deposited. The Complex is composed of two belts of different lithologic characteristics: the western Tailuko Belt of high T/P metamorphism and the eastern Yuli Belt of high P/T metamorphism (Yen, T.P. 1963. Proc. Geol. Soc. China 6, 72-74). The juxtaposition of these two belts has been thought to have resulted from the Late Cretaceous subduction process. In the Tailuko Belt, abundant metabasites occur as a mappable unit, or as enclaves in Late Mesozoic granitic intrusions. Forty-three metabasite samples were collected from the Tailuko Belt and analysed for the major and trace element compositions. The results show that most metabasites are tholeiitic in nature. These metabasites can be divided into three groups based upon their geochemical characteristics: group 1 samples resemble oceanic island-arc tholeiites; group 2 samples have elemental abundances similar to those of T-type MORBs; and group 3 samples are similar to within-plate oceanic plateau-seamount basalts. Metabasite-marble-metachert association in the belt also suggests environment(s) above/near the carbonate compensation depth (CCD). All of these results fit rather well with a marginal/back-arc-basin tectonic setting. Based on the recent PbPb dating result from the associated marble, it is suggested that the island arc/seamounts were accreted to the Southeast Asian continental margin during Early Jurassic time, and the Tailuko Belt represents a subduction/collision complex which has undergone several periods of metamorphism in association with Late Mesozoic and present tectonic events. © 1990.","Institute of Earth Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Geology, University of Western Ontario, London, Ont.

1992.0,Journal of Southeast Asian Earth Sciences,Geochronology and geochemistry of Penghu basalts Taiwan Strait and their tectonic significance,Juang W;Chen J,"The Penghu Islands are located in the Taiwan Strait and consist of 64 islets. These islands, except for Huahsu, are composed mainly of basaltic lavas with minor amounts of sedimentary rocks. The basaltic lavas have effused from many vents rather than from fissure eruption. KAr datings of the basalts, and on planktonic foraminifers and calcareous nannofossils in the sedimentary rocks revealed that the volcanic activity was from Middle Miocene to Late Miocene. The basalts in the Penghu Islands are mainly alkalic and tholeiitic. The presence of many half-graben-type basins in the Tertiary sequence in western Taiwan and the paleostress analysis on the Penghu Islands indicate a continental rifting environment in which the intraplate volcanism occurred. REE data and other evidence suggest that the alkali basalt may have derived from relatively deeper mantle which had been metasomatized by LILE enriched fluid through partial melting. But the tholeiite may have originated from unmetasomatized mantle lherzolite at relatively shallow level by 5-10% equilibrium batch partial melting. Contemporaneous volcanism occurred sporadically during the deposition of Miocene sediments in the western foothills of Taiwan. The volcanic rocks of the western foothills of Taiwan and those of the Penghu Islands are similar in geochronology and geochemistry. They are closely related to Cenozoic rift tectonism along the Asiatic continental margin caused by the third heating and rifting episodic evolution of the South China Sea. © 1992.","National Museum of Natural Science, Taichung, Taiwan; Institute of Oceanography, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,1.0,"Juang, W.S.; National Museum of Natural Science, Taichung, Taiwan","Ministry of Economic AffairsMinistry of Economic Affairs, MOEA","Acknowledgements--Some of the Ar isotope analyses were completed by Prof. H.

1994.0,Journal of Southeast Asian Earth Sciences,Geochemical characteristics of oils from Taiwan,Oung J;Philp R,"Geochemical studies on a number of oils from Taiwan have shown that they are sourced predominantly from terrigenous organic matter. Biomarker characteristics include the presence of high amounts of long-chain regular isoprenoids, bicyclic sesquiterpanes, diterpanes, low concentrations or absence of tricyclic terpanes, presence of several C24 tetracyclic terpanes and some source-specific pentacyclic terpanes and a predominance of C29 steranes. For most of the oils, the n-alkanes extended to C30 or above and have CPI values of approximately 1, indicating the mature nature of these oils. The pristane/phytane ratios, generally in excess of 5, suggest the likely prevalence of a highly oxic, nearshore, marine-open peat swamp depositional environment which incorporated large amounts of terrigenous organic matter. The long-chain isoprenoids extending to C42, and possible higher, are proposed to be regular head-to-tail isoprenoids possibly derived from polyprenols in higher plants. The sesquiterpanes present in the oils range from C15 and C17 and are dominated by 8β(H)-drimane and 8β (H)-homodrimane. The diterpanes include C17-C20 tricyclic and C19 and C20 tetracyclic diterpanes. The presence of diterpanes in these oils suggests that resins derived from conifers contributed to the source of these oils. At least nine tetracyclic terpanes with carbon numbers ranging 24 to 27 were detected in Taiwan oils. Two series of tetracyclic terpanes are apparent, one is the de-A-oleanane/ursane series and the other is the 17,21-secohopane series. The former is more source-specific than the latter and is probably related to the presence of oleanane. A number of pentacyclic terpanes, including oleanane, have been detected and many of these compounds may be of terrigenous origin and source-specific. Oleanane, de-A-oleanane/ursane and de-A-lupane can be used as indicators for angiosperms which have evolved since the late Cretaceous. Sterane distributions in the Taiwan oils are dominated by the C29 steranes and include regular and rearranged steranes, indicating the terrigenous nature of the organic matter in the source rocks. The significance of the variations observed in the biomarker distributions of the oils from Taiwan is discussed in some detail in this paper. © 1994.","School of Geology, Geophysics University of Oklahoma, Norman, OK 73019, United States; Chinese Petroleum Corporation, Offshore and Overseas Petroleum Exploration Division, 4th Fl., No. 3, Peiping West Rd., Taipei, Taiwan, Taiwan",USA;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,USA,USA,2,2.0,0.0,"Oung, J.-N.; School of Geology, , Norman, OK 73019, United States",,NA NA,,10.1016/0743-9547(94)90027-2,Article,biomarker;  geochemistry;  oil;  provenance;  terrigenous organic matter; Taiwan,,Journal of Southeast Asian Earth Sciences,9,9,scopus,GEOPHYSICS UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA,SCHOOL OF GEOLOGY,B2
1995.0,Journal of Southeast Asian Earth Sciences,Development of the shale diapircontrolled Fangliao Canyon on the continental slope off southwestern Taiwan,Yu H;Jiunn C L J,"Fangliao Canyon is one of several major canyons on the continental slope off southwestern Taiwan. This paper evaluates the canyon morphology and its formative processes and origin using multichannel seismic reflection profiles and bathymetric data. Fangliao Canyon is a small canyon around 10 km wide and 60 km long, an order of magnitude smaller than the large canyons of the world. This canyon can be divided into two morphologically contrasting parts: the upper canyon, a relatively straight part beginning at the shelf edge and ending approximately at the 600 m isobath, and the lower canyon, consisting of two segments separated by a rising linear ridge (shale diapir) and extending downslope to about the 1000 m isobath where its mouths lack submarine fans. Seismic profiles and bathymetric data provide evidence of submarine erosion forming the upper canyon and the uplift of a shale diapir controlling the formation of the lower canyon. In the upper canyon, truncation of parallel flat-lying strata and sliding/slumping features on the canyon walls are indicative of downcutting and lateral widening of the canyon. In the lower canyon, the shale diapir uplifted the slope strata and protruded through the overlying slope sediments, producing a ridge rising from the sea floor. Here the steep flanks of the shale diapir become the walls of the steep-sided canyons. The interaction of these sedimentary and tectonic processes on the continental slope off southwestern Taiwan forms the present Fangliao Canyon. © 1995.","Division of Marine Geology and Geophysics, Institute of Oceanography, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,,"Yu, H.-S.; Division of Marine Geology and Geophysics, Institute of Oceanography, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan",,NA NA,,10.1016/0743-9547(95)00004-C,Article,bathymetry;  continental slope;  diapirism;  formative processes;  morphology;  seismic reflection;  shale diapir;  submarine canyon;  submarine canyons; Pacific; Fangliao Canyon;  South China Sea; Fangliao Canyon,,Journal of Southeast Asian Earth Sciences,27,11,scopus,NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY,NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY,A

Geoinformacije,Retrieval of aerosol optical depth using satellite data associated with groundbased observations over urban and rural areas Racunanje opticke dubine aerosola na temelju satelitskih podataka povezanih s opažanjima na tlu u urbanim i ruralnim podrucjima,Le L;Hang H;Cao C;Nguyen N;Nguyen L;Le H;Pham L;Le C;Tang-Huang L,"Aerosol optical depth (AOD) can be retrieved accurately with sequential ground-based measurements of direct and diffuse solar radiance. However, spatial coverage and location frequency cause certain limitations. Hence, satellite image data are a proper tool for obtaining aerosol optical depth products with more spatial information and patterns of aerosol distribution. Currently, aerosol remote sensing may enhance our understanding of the optimal approach to AOD retrieval over urban and rural areas, and how it differs due to the characteristics of surface reflectivity. The article deals with the concepts of contrast reduction, and dark target approaches are examined using Landsat imaging and the observation of a sun photometer for integrating aerosol optical depth distribution over the city of Taipei in Taiwan. For areas with bright surfaces, such as urban areas, the above concepts were applied using the dispersion coefficient method with a sun photometer, in order to reduce errors considerably in the product. In contrast, a dark target algorithm with a relationship of surface reflectance between the blue (0.49 µm), red (0.66 µm), and infrared (2.1 µm) spectral bands is suitable for moist soils and vegetation areas. The retrieval of AOD spatial distribution is compared with MODIS AOD products and AERONET to verify the accuracy of the results. The RMSE ranged from 0.2 to 0.4, and about 50% of the data were within expected error margins (EE=± (0.05+0.1 5 AODsunphotometer). © 2019, Croatian Cartographic Society.

2015.0,Lethaia,Evidence for targeted elasmobranch predation on thalassinidean shrimp in the Miocene Taliao Formation NE Taiwan,Lowemark L,"Terrestrial and marine invertebrate organisms both leave records of their activities in the sediment in the form of trace fossils, at least during certain stages of their ontogeny. In contrast, trace fossils produced by vertebrate organisms are scarce, although terrestrial trace fossils provide exclusive insights into the social behaviour of their producers. In the marine realm, vertebrate trace fossils are relatively rare, difficult to identify and problematic to interpret. However, in certain settings, observations on serendipitously preserved and exposed trace fossils can shed light on the predatory behaviour of marine vertebrates. In Miocene outer shelf to nearshore sandstones of the Taliao Formation in NE Taiwan, large numbers of bowl-shaped trace fossils can be observed. Morphology and size range (diameter typically 10-30cm, average depth around 10cm) of these trace fossils agree well with feeding traces of modern stingrays, and the trace fossil Piscichnus waitemata, which has been attributed to bottom feeding rays. Stingrays direct a jet of water from their mouths to excavate a bowl-shaped pit to expose their prey. In the material filling the excavated bowl, broken pieces of two other common trace fossils, Ophiomorpha and Schaubcylindrichnus, are often found, and in a number of cases, vertical shafts of Ophiomorpha surrounded by dispersed pieces of wall material have been observed. In contrast, surrounding sediment rarely contains this kind of broken pieces of wall material. These observations clearly indicate that stingrays specifically targeted the producers of the trace fossils: thalassinoid crustaceans and worms, respectively. The targeted predation of these relatively deep burrowers furthermore suggests that the rays used their electroreceptive organs to locate the prey; as such, direct targeting of buried prey only based on olfactory senses has been shown to be ineffective in experiments with extant myliobatiform rays.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei 106, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,1,1.0,1.0,"Lowemark, L (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, POB 13-318, Taipei 106, Taiwan.","Ivar Bendixson's foundation for docents at Stockholm University; National Science Council of the R.O.CMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan",Field work of this study was partially funded by a scholarship from Ivar Bendixson's foundation for docents at Stockholm University and by the National Science Council of the R.O.C.

The present retrospective study aims to compare the efficacy of the patient-friendly ovarian stimulation protocol with that of the antagonist protocol on normal and high responders aged between 24 and 39 years in a tertiary fertility center in Taiwan. To prevent premature luteinizing hormone (LH) surge, oral MPA was given to patients in group 1 (n = 57), whereas antagonist protocol was applied to group 2 (n = 53). Duration and dosage of stimulation, number of injections and visits before trigger, incidence of premature LH surge, number of oocytes retrieved, fertilization rate, cleavage rate, rate of good embryos available, incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, cumulative clinical pregnancy rate and live birth rate per retrieval were compared between groups. We conclude that our patient-friendly ovarian stimulation protocol with MPA demonstrates satisfactory stimulation and reproductive outcomes that are comparable to those of an antagonist protocol. © 2020 by the authors.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in countering oral pathogens and develop related products. After a series of assays to 450 LAB strains, 8 heat-inactivated strains showed a strong inhibitory effect on a caries pathogen, Streptococcus mutans, and 308 heat-inactivated LAB strains showed a strong inhibitory effect on a periodontal pathogen, Porphyromonas gingivalis. The key reasons for inhibiting oral pathogens were bacteriocins produced by LAB and the coaggregation effect of the inactivated cells. We selected Lacticaseibacillus (Lb) paracasei 111 and Lb. paracasei 141, which had the strongest inhibitory effects on the above pathogens, was the main oral health food source. The optimal cultural conditions of Lb. paracasei 111 and Lb. paracasei 141 were studied. An oral tablet with a shelf life of 446 days made of the above strains was developed.

2021.0,Life,Evaluating the ehealth cloud computing systems adoption in Taiwans healthcare industry,Chang S;Lu M;Pan T;Chen C,"Although the electronic health (e-health) cloud computing system is a promising innovation, its adoption in the healthcare industry has been slow. This study investigated the adoption of e-health cloud computing systems in the healthcare industry and considered security functions, management, cloud service delivery, and cloud software for e-health cloud computing systems. Although numerous studies have determined factors affecting e-health cloud computing systems, few comprehensive reviews of factors and their relations have been conducted. Therefore, this study investigated the relations between the factors affecting e-health cloud computing systems by using a multiple criteria decision-making technique, in which decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL), DANP (DEMATEL-based Analytic Network Process), and modified VIKOR (VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje) approaches were combined. The intended level of adoption of an e-health cloud computing system could be determined by using the proposed approach. The results of a case study performed on the Taiwanese healthcare industry indicated that the cloud management function must be primarily enhanced and that cost effectiveness is the most significant factor in the adoption of e-health cloud computing.

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is common among children and adolescents, and influences their academic, vocational, and social life. Previous studies have suggested an association between strabismus and ADHD. Using data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database between 2000 and 2010, we performed a large-scale cohort study comparing the incidence, risk factors, and severity of ADHD in children with and without strabismus. A total of 2049 patients <18 years old with newly diagnosed strabismus (esotropia: 404; exotropia: 1645) were identified, and 8196 age-and sex-matched controls without strabismus were also included. After an average of 6.5 ± 2.9 years of follow-up, the incidence of ADHD per 1000 person-years was 5.39 in the strabismus group (esotropia: 9.93; exotropia: 4.11) and 3.23 in the control group. The cumulative incidence of ADHD was significantly greater in the esotropia (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.04; 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.36–3.06; p = 0.0007) and exotropia groups (HR: 1.44; 95% CI: 1.03–2.03; p = 0.038) than in the controls. Patients with strabismus had more comorbidities than those without (p < 0.05). In summary, this large-scale study found a higher cumulative incidence of ADHD in patients with strabismus, especially in those with esotropia. © 2021 by the authors.

1997.0,Lithos,Major and trace element and SrNd isotope constraints on the origin of Paleogene volcanism in South China prior to the South China sea opening,Chung S;Cheng H;Jahn B;OReilly S;Zhu B,"Paleogene volcanic rocks crop out in three sedimentary basins, namely, Sanshui, Heyuan and Lienping, in the attenuated continental margin of south China. Lavas from the Sanshui basin which erupted during 64-43 Ma are bimodal, consisting of intraplate tholeiitic basalt and trachyte/rhyolite associations. Similar to Cretaceous A-type granites from the nearby region, the felsic member shows peralkaline nature [Na2O + K2O approximate to 10-12%; (Na + K)/Al approximate to 0.98-1.08], general enrichment in the incompatible trace elements and significant depletion in Ba, Sr, Eu, P and Ti. Although both types of the Sanshui lavas have rather uniform Nd isotope compositions [epsilon(Nd)(T) approximate to +6 to +4] that are comparable to Late Cenozoic basalts around the South China Sea, the felsic rocks possess apparently higher initial Sr isotope ratios (I-Sr up to similar to 0.713) and form a horizontal array to the right in the Nd vs. Sr isotope plot. Closed system differentiation of mantle-derived magmas in a 'double diffusive' magma chamber is considered for the bimodal volcanism, in which the trachytes and rhyolites represent A-type melts after extensive crystal fractionation in the upper portion of the chamber. Such A-type melts were later contaminated by small amounts (1-3%) of upper crustal materials during ascent. On the other hand, composition of lavas in the other two basins varies from tholeiitic basalt to andesite. Their Sr and Nd isotope ratios [I-Sr approximate to 0.705 to 0.711; epsilon(Nd)(T) approximate to +1 to -5] and generally correlative Nb-Ta depletions suggest a distinct magma chamber process involving fractional crystallization concomitant with assimilation of the country rock. We conclude that these Paleogene volcanic activities resulted from the lithospheric extension in south China that migrated southwards and eventually led to opening of the South China Sea during similar to 30-16 Ma.

2001.0,Lithos,HighMg potassic rocks from Taiwan implications for the genesis of orogenic potassic lavas,Chung S;Wang K;Crawford A;Kamenetsky V;Chen C;Lan C;Chen C,"Taiwan is an active mountain belt formed by oblique collision between the Luzon are and the Asian continent. Regardless of the ongoing collision in central and southern Taiwan, a post-collisional extension regime has developed since the Plio-Pleistocene in the northern part of this orogen, and led to generation of the Northern Taiwan Volcanic Zone. Emplaced at similar to0.2 Ma in the southwest of the Volcanic Zone, lavas from the Tsaolingshan volcano are highly magnesian (MgO approximate to 15 wt.%) and potassic (K2O approximate to 5 wt.%, K2O/Na2O approximate to 1.6-3.0). Whereas these basic rocks (SiO2 approximate to 48 wt.%) have relatively low Al2O3 approximate to 12 wt.%, total Fe2O3 approximate to 7.5 wt.% and CaO approximate to 7.2 wt.%, they are extremely enriched in large ion lithophile elements (LILE, e.g. Cs, Rb, Ba, Th and U). The Rb and Cs abundances, > 1000 and 120 ppm, respectively, are among the highest known from terrestrial rocks. In addition, these rocks are enriched in light rare earth elements (LREE), depleted in high Field strength elements (HFSE), and display a positive Pb spike in the primitive mantle-normalized variation diagram. Their REE distribution patterns mark with slight Eu negative anomalies (Eu/Eu * approximate to 0.90 - 0.84), and Sr and Nd isotope ratios are uniform (Sr-87/Sr-86 approximate to 0.70540-0.70551; Nd-143/(144) Nd approximate to 0.51268-0.51259). Olivine, the major phenocryst phase, shows high Fo contents (90.4 +/- 1.8; 1 sigma deviation), which are in agreement with the whole rock Mg-values (83 - 80). Spinel inclusions in olivine are characterized by high Cr/Cr+Al ratios (0.94-0.82) and have compositions similar to those from boninites that originate from highly refractory peridotites. Such petrochemical characteristics are comparable to the Group I ultrapotassic rocks defined by Foley et al. [Earth-Sci. Rev. 24 (1987) 81], such as orogenic lamproites from central Italy, Span and Tibet, We therefore suggest that the Tsaolingshan lavas resulted from a phlogopite-bearing harzburgitic source in the lithospheric mantle that underwent a recent metasomatism by the nearby Ryukyu subduction zone processes. The lavas exhibit unique incompatible trace element ratios, with Rb/Cs approximate to 8, Ba/Rb approximate to 1, Ce/Pb approximate to 2, Th/U approximate to 1 and Nb/ U approximate to 0.8, which are significantly lower than the continental crust values and those of most mantle-derived magmas. Nonmagmatic enrichment in the mantle source is therefore required. Based on published experimental data, two subduction-related metasomatic components, i.e., slab-released hydrous fluid and subducted sediment, are proposed, and the former is considered to be more pervasive for causing the extraordinary trace element ratios observed. Our observations lend support to the notion that dehydration from subducting slabs at convergent margins, as a continuing process through geologic time, can account for the fractionation of these elemental pairs between the Earth's crust and mantle.

2011.0,Lithos,Geochronologic evidence for a cold arccontinent collision The Taiwan orogeny,Wintsch R;Yang H;Li X;Tung K,"In order to constrain the tectonic consequences of the collision of the Luzon arc with the SE Chinese continental margin during the Neogene Taiwan orogeny, we assess the thermal history of the poly-metamorphic para-autochtthonous rocks of the continental margin in Taiwan. To accomplish this we report a new SIMS U-Pb age of prograde metamorphic zircons and interpret this age in the context of existing geochronology and thermochronology. Zircons extracted from the Fenniaolin amphibolite near Nanao, Taiwan, in the contact aureole of a granodiorite, are interpreted to have crystallized during the first lower amphibolite fades prograde metamorphism based on [1] their equant shape rather than the prismatic shape typical of magmatic zircon, [2] their microcrystalline or ""micro-saccharoidal"" aggregate structure and patchy and sector zoning rather than oscillatory zoning visible in cathodoluminescent imaging, [3] their low concentrations of U (most<40 ppm), [4] their chlorite inclusions, and [5] their inclusion within prograde metamorphic amphiboles. The apparent absence of magmatic zircon is also consistent with the low Zr concentrations of the N-MORB metabasaltic protolith. SIMS analyses of 18 zircon grains yield a concordant Pb-206/U-238 age ge of 86 +/- 1 Ma, analytically indistinguishable from the age of the adjacent pluton that caused the contact metamorphism. We thus conclude that the contact metamorphism of this intrusion caused the first lower amphibolite facies metamorphism of these rocks in the mid-Cretaceous. Existing Ar-40/Ar-39 and Rb-Sr cooling ages of both amphibole and muscovite at similar to 80 Ma (e.g. Lan, 1990; Lo and Onstott, 1995) show that the granodiorite and its contact aureole cooled rapidly from similar to 700 degrees to <400 degrees C in similar to 5 m.., indicating that the ambient temperature of the country rocks at the time of intrusion was less than the closure temperature of Ar diffusion in muscovite. Existing thermobarometry on rocks in the contact aureole yield pressures of similar to 5 kb, equivalent to a depth of 15-20 km. Cooling ages of biotite and K-feldspar in the literature reflect slow cooling at <2 degrees C/m.y. for more than 50 m.y. to at least 20 Ma, suggesting atectonic cooling. The crustal history reconstructed from these data shows that the regional 'gneissic' terrane of the northern Tananao complex may have been caused by coalescing contact aureoles of multiple mid-Cretaceous intrusions (the 'Nanao intrusive event'), and not by the Neogene Taiwan orogeny. On the contrary, the Tananao rocks probably achieved middle greenschist conditions and 15-20 km depth in a forearc setting in the Early Cretaceous. This intrusive event caused 'regional contact metamorphism' at about 85 Ma, after which the passive margin setting preserved these rocks at mid-crustal depths until the beginning of the Taiwan orogeny (similar to 5 Ma). These depths (10-12 km) and temperatures (similar to 200-250 degrees C) were high enough to account for the late Miocene lower greenschist fades cleavages and the Pliocene-Pleistocene fission track cooling ages without additional loading and heating from the Taiwan orogeny.

2012.0,Lithos,Age and geochemical characteristics of Paleogene basalts drilled from western Taiwan Records of initial rifting at the southeastern Eurasian continental margin,Wang K;Chung S;Lo Y;Lo C;Yang H;Shinjo R;Lee T;Wu J;Huang S,"The southeastern Eurasian continental margin has been characterized by formation of rift basins associated with intraplate basaltic volcanism since early Cenozoic time. In contrast to Paleogene volcanic rocks that occur sporadically in the basins, Neogene basalts are more widespread on land as lava flows and pyroclastics in the Taiwan Strait (Penghu Islands) and northwestern Taiwan. To better understand the tectonomagmatic evolution, in particular the initial rifting record, this study reports new age, major- and trace-elemental, and Sr-Nd-Pb isotope data of volcanic rocks drilled from several locations in the Taiwan Strait and western Taiwan. Ar-40/Ar-39 dating results show two main episodes of volcanic activities: similar to 56-38 Ma (Eocene) and similar to 11-8 Ma (late Miocene). The volcanic rocks are composed dominantly of basalts and basaltic andesites, and subordinately of dacites and rhyolites of Eocene age. The two episodes of basaltic volcanism have distinct geochemical characteristics. Comparatively, the Eocene basalts are more depleted in basaltic components such as Ca. Fe and Ti. but have higher Al content. They are also more enriched in large ion lithophile elements (ULE) and light rare earth elements (LREE), and show depletions in high field strength elements (HFSE). Sr-Nd-Pb isotope compositions of the late Miocene basalts are relatively more uniform and unradiogenic (epsilon Nd = + 6.0 to + 3.8), similar to those of Miocene basalts from NW Taiwan and Penghu Islands. and broadly coeval OIB-type basalts from the South China Sea. However, the Eocene basalts have a wider range in isotope ratios (e.g., epsilon Nd-(tau) = + 5.6 to -3.2) pointing towards an enriched mantle source. The overall geochemical characteristics suggest two distinct mantle sources: (1) a more refractory mantle source metasomatized by subduction-related processes to generate the Eocene basalts and (2) a fertile but isotopically depleted mantle source for the late Miocene basalts. These two source components are proposed to reside in the lithospheric mantle and asthenosphere, respectively. The change in magma sources with time reflects the evolution of an extensional regime within the Eurasian continental margin from an initial rifting to a well-established stage accomplished by thinning of the lithosphere and associated upwelling of the asthenosphere. The Eocene bimodal volcanism entails a transition from the latest Cretaceous magmatism in the western Taiwan Strait that not only signals incipient rifting in the region, but also records geochemical inputs from the subducted Paleo-Pacific plate to the southeastern Eurasian lithospheric mantle. As the preexisting, subduction-related component had been preferentially overprinted by the Eocene magma generation, there was a magmatic quiescence in the Oligocene before the onset of Miocene basaltic volcanism that resulted essentially from decompression melting of the ascended asthenospheric mantle.

2016.0,Lithos,The influence of Ryukyu subduction on magma genesis in the Northern Taiwan Volcanic Zone and Middle Okinawa Trough Evidence from boron isotopes,Pi J;You C;Wang K,"Boron (B) is an excellent geochemical tracer for investigating crustal recycling processes at convergent margins, due to its high fluid mobility under high P-T conditions, distinct elemental abundances and isotopic compositions in the mantle wedge and subducting slabs. The Northern Taiwan Volcanic Zone (NTVZ), wherein the nature of magma genesis has long been a topic of debate, is located at the rear side of the Okinawa Trough (OT), an atypical back-arc rift in the Ryukyu subduction system. In this study, B and B isotopes (delta B-11) were measured in 19 volcanic rocks collected from the NTVZ and the middle Okinawa Trough (MOT) to assess the influence of the Ryukyu subduction system on magma genesis. The B concentrations in the MOT and NTVZ volcanic rocks are 5.8 to 13.6 mg/L and 22 to 48.6 mg/L, respectively. The large B abundances variation in the NTVZ was caused mainly by variable degrees of partial melting. The Nb/B and delta(11)Bin the MOT have small ranges of 0.5 to 0.6 and -2.7%,, to 0.2%., respectively, whereas they range widely from 0.4 to 2.5 and from -8.6%. to 2.4 parts per thousand, respectively in the NTVZ. These Nb/B values suggest that the magma contains a smaller subduction component than that normally observed in arcs, although this component is still more substantial than in a typical back-arc setting. The delta B-11 results indicate insignificant influence of the subducting Philippine Sea Plate at 2.6 Ma, but it becomes more substantial later in the NTVZ. The mixing proportions of sediment derived fluids in onshore volcanoes in the NTVZ imply a rather heterogeneous mantle wedge near the plate boundary, most likely due to either a heterogeneous source of slab derived fluids or more complicated mantle flow. A substantial B flux from the subducting slab in the incipient back-arc rifting in the MOT and NTVZ may reflect characteristics of a cold, steep and fast subducting slab, which may be capable of carrying volatiles efficiently into greater depth in subduction zones. The delta B-11 data also provide insight into the nature of the different subduction components. A three-end-member mixing model suggests that MOT and NTVZ magmas may have incorporated subduction fluids derived from altered oceanic crustorserpentinite, whereas the onshore volcanoes in the NTVZ, and in particular in the Tsaolingshan, may have involved a higher proportion of sediment component.

2017.0,Lithos,Age geochemical and isotopic variations in volcanic rocks from the Coastal Range of Taiwan Implications for magma generation in the Northern Luzon Arc,Lai Y;Song S;Lo C;Lin T;Chu M;Chung S,"This paper reports the first systematic analysis of age and geochemical variations in volcanic rocks from the Coastal Range of Taiwan, the Northern Luzon Arc. The rocks, recovered from four main volcanoes, vary from low-K tholeiitic to medium-K calc-alkaline basalts to dacites. The rocks are typical of arc magmatic products, exhibiting enrichment in the large ion lithophile elements and depletion in the high field strength elements. Our new Ar-40/Ar-39 age data constrain the youngest eruption time in each of the four volcanoes, i.e., from north to south, at similar to 7.2 Ma (Yuemei), similar to 42 Ma (Chimei), similar to 6.2 Ma (Chengkuang'ao) and similar to 8.5 Ma (Tuluanshan), respectively. These data indicate that volcanism in the Northern Luzon Arc did not cease progressively from north to south, as previously alleged. The high and broadly uniform Nd isotope ratios [epsilon(Nd) = +10.1 to +8.8] and trace element characteristics of the rocks suggest a principal magma source from the depleted mantle wedge. Their overall geochemical variations are ascribed to magma chamber processes. The effects of magmatic differentiation and crustal contamination differ among each volcano, most likely owing to the discrepancy of residence time in individual magma chambers. Consequently, we propose a binary mixing model for the magma generation that involves arc magmas sourced from the depleted mantle wedge and up to similar to 5% crustal contamination with a continental fragment split off from the Eurasian margin.

2019.0,Lithos,Feedback of mantle metasomatism on olivine microfabric and seismic properties of the deep lithosphere,Kourim F;Beinlich A;Wang K;Michibayashi K;O'Reilly S;Pearson N,"The interaction of hydrous fluids and melts with dry rocks of the lithospheric mantle inevitably modifies their viscoelastic and chemical properties due to the formation of compositionally distinct secondary phases. In addition, melt percolation and the associated metasomatic alteration of mantle rocks may also facilitate modification of the pre-existing rock texture and olivine crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) and thus seismic properties. Here we explore the relationship between mantle metasomatism, deformation and seismic anisotropy using subduction-related mantle xenoliths from the Penghu Islands, western Taiwan. The investigated xenoliths have equilibrated at upper lithospheric mantle conditions (879 degrees C to 1127 degrees C) based on pyroxene geothermometry and show distinct variations in clinopyroxene chemical composition, texture and olivine CPO allowing for the classification of two distinct groups. Group 1 xenoliths contain rare earth element (REE) depleted clinopyroxene, show a porphyroclastic texture and olivine grains are mostly characterized by [100]-axial pattern symmetries. In contrast, REE-enriched clinopyroxene from Group 2 xenoliths occur in a fine-grained equigranular texture and coexisting olivine frequently displays [010]-axial pattern symmetries. The clinopyroxene compositions are indicative of cryptic and modal to stealth metasomatic alteration of Group 1 and Group 2 xenoliths, respectively. Furthermore, the observed olivine [100]-axial pattern of Group 1 xenoliths reflects deformation by dislocation creep at high temperature, low pressure and dry conditions, whereas olivine [010]-axial patterns of Group 2 xenoliths imply activation of olivine [001] glide planes along preferentially wet (010) grain boundaries. This correlation indicates that the variation in olivine CPO symmetry from [100]-to [010]-axial pattern in Penghu xenoliths results from deformation and intra-crystalline recovery by subgrain rotation during metasomatic alteration induced by melt percolation. The microstructural observations and olivine CPO combined with petrological and geochemical data suggest that Group 1 xenoliths preserve microstructural and chemical characteristics of an old, probably Proterozoic lithosphere, while Group 2 xenoliths record localized Miocene deformation associated with wall-rock heating and metasomatism related to melt circulation. Furthermore, the observed transition of olivine CPO from [100]-axial pattern to [010]-axial pattern by deformation in the presence of variable melt fractions and associated metasomatic alteration can be inferred to modify the physical properties of mantle rocks.

2020.0,Lithos,Exotic origin of Pingtan Island in the PingtanDongshan Metamorphic Belt SE China Zircon UPb age and Hf isotope evidences,Lin J;Lee C;Chen C;Sano Y;Takahata N;Chung S,"Cathaysia Block in South China had accreted tremendous amounts of Mesozoic magmatic rocks. Recent zircon U-Pb age results revealed existence of some Early Jurassic gneissic granites (200-190 Ma) in the Pingtan-Dongshan Metamorphic Belt (PDMB). coastal SE China which corresponds one stage of magmatic quiescence in the rest part of East Cathaysia. To better understand Mesozoic thermal evolution of the PDMB. U-Pb geochronology and Hf isotope composition of zircon separates (LA-ICPMS) and inclusions (NanoSIMS, age only) are examined for two granitic rocks and one meta-sandstone in Pingtan area (northern PDMB) and three granites in Matsu Islands further north. For Pingtan rocks, ages of discrete zircons give two Early Jurassic ages (196 Ma and 173 Ma) and prossess in dominance positive &If( t) values (-0.2 to 7.5). On the other hand, zircon inclusions within rock-forming minerals yield a wide age span from Permo-Triassic to Early Cretaceous in six clusters, namely 270-206 Ma, 191-170 Ma, 168-151 Ma, 146-132 Ma, 126-119 Ma and 109-100 Ma that basically coincide the major Mesozoic thermal episodes in Cathaysia except the second cluster. For Matsu granites, discrete zircons exhibit Late Jurassic (162-158 Ma) and Early Cretaceous (137 Ma) ages with cHf(t) values of -9.1 to -1.6 and -4.9 to -0.8, respectively. Nevertheless, zircon inclusions show ages corresponding to Pingtan samples in the last four clusters. With reference to Mesozoic magmatic rock units in the neighboring Southeast China Magmatic Belt (SCMB), our data suggest irrelevance of Pingtan samples to the Cathaysia and linkage of off-shore Matsu granites to the PDMB. Noting that there are similarities of zircon ages and ri-lf(t) values between the granite-schist associations in Tananao Metamorphic Belt (TMB) of eastern Taiwan and Pingtan island of northern PDMB, these Early Jurassic granites were probably originated from a same source. Three consistent Early Cretaceous age clusters of zircon inclusions over the studied samples match two well-known magma prevailing episodes in the coastal SE China, with one tectonic episode (128-119 Ma) in the PDMB that is often invisible from the zircon separates remains unexplainable. In response to a plausible tectonic evolution, we support the earlier proposition for a now-concealed microcontinent that had impinged on Cathaysia around 125 Ma, but further suggest that it left Pingtan Island behind as a remnant fragment when drifted away at later time.

2012.0,Lithosphere,Coseismic indentorrelated deformation during the termination of subduction and its associated geophysical characteristics An example from Taiwan,Chi W,"Collision is among the important processes for the growth of continents, and the way in which subduction becomes a collision is still an active research topic. Here, I examine the seismogenic structures of southern and central Taiwan where the subduction along the Manila Trench has terminated and given way to an arc-continent collision on land. Based on focal mechanisms and seven finite-fault slip models, coseismic tectonic extrusion is active in this region, in which the basement highs on the incoming passive margin are acting as indentors and strongly modifying the seismic moment release patterns in the collision zone. At least three magnitude 7 earthquakes have ruptured both north and south of an indentor called the Peikang high in the past hundred years. After examination, the basement highs show little global positioning system (GPS)-recorded relative motion with respect to the incoming passive margin; high Bouguer gravity anomalies associated with denser materials of the basement; and low heat flow due to less dewatering and exhumation. With regard to seismogenic structures, faster GPS relative motions, lower Bouguer gravity anomalies, and higher heat flow characterize the regions surrounding the indentors. Similar processes might be operating in other arc-continent collision zones. For other regions where there are fewer seismic instruments to monitor earthquakes, it might be helpful to combine a geological survey with gravity and other geophysical data sets to help identify such potential seismogenic structures.

The tentative lithostratigraphic subdivision of the Tananao Schist in this area includes the Tienhsiang, Kanagan, Chiuchu, and Changchun Formations. Sheath folds or 'eye' folds on decimetric to metric scales are well-developed in the metachert-marble-green schist interlayered rocks of the Changchun Formation and in the marble lens of the Tienhsiang Formation. The sheath folds are believed to be formed during the second phase of deformation in this region. The traces of the earlier folding can generally be found at the hinges or limbs of these sheath folds. Two later cleavage traces cut across them, and minor third-generation folds occur on the limbs of the earlier structures. Where the 'eye' structures are bent by later folds, they often occur as mushroom-shaped patterns. The explanation presented here is that they were generated throughout an entire history of progressive shearing as a result of episodic instability of the flow with successive refolding of metamorphic fabric.-from Authors","Dept Geology, Nat Taiwan Univ, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC., Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,,2,1.0,,,,NA NA,,,Article,,,Memoir - Geological Society of China,0,6,scopus,,,X

1981.0,Memoir of the Geological Society of China (Taiwan),Change of Xray diffraction pattern of Kmicas in the metapelites of Taiwan and its implication for metamorphic grade,Chen C,"A regular change in the XRD whole-rock pattern of K-micas was observed in shale, argillite, slate, phyllite and black schist. The peak intensity of the (002) plane relative to that of (110) increases with the crystallinity and the degree of orientation of mica plates in the rock. A linear relationship exists between the two peaks, from which a relative intensity variation scale (SR) is derived. Illite has SR values = or &lt;1.1, sericite &gt; 1.1 &lt; 2.0+ or -, and muscovite 2M1 has Sr values = or &lt;2.0: thus K-micas may be identified by their SR values. SR values are given for Miocene shale and mudstone, Palaeogene shale and argillite, Palaeogene-Miocene slate and phyllite, and black schists. It is apparent that rocks of different metamorphic grades have different lower limits of SR values. It is concluded that in the range SR = or &lt; 2, the SR value is more T- dependent that P-dependent, and higher values generally mean better crystallinity. In the range SR &gt; 2, P and directed stress become more important. Higher SR value also means better orientation of the mica plates in the rock. SR value to some extent reflects metamorphic grade of metapelites. -P.Br.","Central Geological Survey, MOEA, Taipei, Taiwan., Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,,1,1.0,,,,NA NA,,,Article,,,Memoir of the Geological Society of China (Taiwan),4,4,scopus,,,X

The collision is occurring in an uncommon style, characterized by the point impact of the leading edge of one plate orthogonally upon that of the other, instead of a lengthwise suture of two parallel edges. The two colliding plate edges exhibit different manners of movement: a segment of the edge of one plate turns abruptly to run in front of the end of the other plate, which remains straight; the straight plate-edge along a longitudinal strike-slip fault between the two moves towards the turned segment of the arcuate plate-edge to collide with it finally. -P.Br.","Geology Dept., Chinese Culture Univ., Yangmingshan, Taipei 113, Taiwan., Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,,1,1.0,,,,NA NA,,,Article,,,Memoir of the Geological Society of China (Taiwan),23,4,scopus,,,X

Schists from the Yuli formation contain unusually large porphyroblastic sphene and aligned, medium-grained fresh ilmenite, and the Fe-Ti oxide mineral assemblage in metamorphic tectonic blocks of the Yuli formation is magnetite-rutile with or without sphene. The characteristic textural features of the Fe-Ti oxide minerals help to identify basic igneous rocks as the parents of some Tananao amphibolites and metabasites. The common association of sphene, calcite and quartz in the Tananao schists, except for the tectonic block group, suggests partial PCO2 during metamorphism was probably &lt;1 kbar. The frequent occurrence of rutile or ilmenite rimmed by sphene suggests that these minerals reacted with pyroxene to form sphene in the amphibolites and metabasites, or with feldspar to form sphene in the gneisses during metamorphism.

1981.0,Memoir of the Geological Society of China (Taiwan),Tectonic implication of Neogene volcanism on the continental shelf of western Taiwan,Juan V;Chen C;Lo H,"Neogene volcanism on the continental shelf of W Taiwan occurred mainly in three episodes: Early Miocene Kungkuan, Late Miocene Kuanshi-Chiaopanshan and the Plio-Pleistocene Penghu volcanic stages. Both alkali basalts and tholeiites were produced, but all were derived from a common source of primary alkali olivine basaltic magma. The loci of Neogene volcanism were distributed linearly with geological time from N Taiwan to the Penghu Islands. Discrimination diagrams of immobile trace elements of basaltic rocks show that volcanism was not related to plate subduction but more likely reflected continental rifting. Geological and geophysical data indicate that this volcanism could have resulted from upper mantle plumes at a relatively fixed hot-spot at Penghu Islands. It is concluded that Neogene volcanism occurred along a continental rift extending from Penghu Islands NE to N Taiwan. The total displacement of the loci is approx 300 km in 20 m.y., with an average drifting rate of 1.5 cm/yr for the W Taiwan continental plate from Early Miocene to Plio-Pleistocene. -P.Br.","Inst. of Geology, National Taiwan Univ., Taipei, Taiwan., Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,,3,1.0,,,,NA NA,,,Article,,,Memoir of the Geological Society of China (Taiwan),6,4,scopus,,,X

1983.0,Memoir of the Geological Society of China (Taiwan),High pressure petrological study of Tatun volcanic rocks from northern Taiwan,Liu T;Huang W,"Three natural rocks from the Tatun volcano group were reacted in a high-P piston-cylinder apparatus. The crystallization sequence of each rock was determined under 5, 10 and 20 kbar, and with zero, 5, 10 and 20 wt.% of water added. The liquidus T and the slope (dT/dP) at 5 kbar with no water added are, respectively 1205oC and 60o/10 kbar for Hunglushan basalt, 1195oC and 55oC/10 kbar for Shantienchi andesite, and 1190oC/10 kbar for Kuanyinshan andesite. The T intervals for crystallization of observed phenocrysts in the three rocks are 60oC, 160oC and 160oC, respectively. Comparing the experimental results with the observed crystallization sequence in Hunglushan basalt, it is inferred that the depth, T, and water content during crystallization of phenocrysts must, respectively, be <30 km, 1190oC, and 7.5%. Depth and T for crystallization of phenocrysts in Shantienchi andesite must be <70 km and 1100oC. The phenocrysts in Kuanyinshan andesite may not form deeper than 70 km. On the basis of near-liquidus phase relationships, the present investigation suggests that if Tatun andesitic rocks originated from fractional crystallization of Hunglushan basaltic magma, the crystal cumulates may be plagioclase, clinopyroxene, and Fe-Ti oxides at depths >70 km, but this explanation does not preclude the possibility of other geneses of andesitic rocks.

The main mineral assemblage is albite + chlorite + calcite + titanomagnetite + or - quartz + or - sphene + or - hematite + or - anatase + or - ilmenite + or - (?)epidote. The Ca-Al silicates are thought to have been suppressed by fairly high fCO2 during spilitization. The present spilite is interpreted as having derived from the spilitization of basic volcanic rocks; due to lack of diagnostic Ca-Al silicates, it can only be inferred to have taken place in a rather broad T-P range defined by zeolite, prehnite-pumpellyite and lower greenschist facies. From spilite textures and relict minerals, the parental rocks may have been trachybasalts.

1984.0,Memoir of the Geological Society of China (Taiwan),A preliminary study of the chemical composition of metapelites from the Central Range of Taiwan,Chen C;Wang C;Jeng R,"Some 19 metapelite samples from the Central Range of Taiwan were analysed using wet chemical methods. The contents of K2O, Na2O, MgO + FeOtot, CO2 and S depend mainly on the amounts of muscovite, albite, chlorite, carbonates (calcite and ankerite) and pyrite, respectively. High muscovite content also leads to high % Al2O3, whereas high quartz content leads to high % SiO2. Correlations imply that carbonates are the major Ca-bearing minerals, muscovite is the major Ti-bearing mineral, and chlorite is the major Mn-bearing mineral. The Fe2O3/FeO ratio of metapelites depends mainly on fO2 and mineral species; muscovite generally has higher Fe2O3/FeO ratios than chlorite, and argillite and poorly cleaved slate generally have higher Fe2O3/FeO ratios than normal slate, phyllite and black schist. Conversion of feldspars into muscovite increases quartz content of metapelite, but solution of quartz in water decreases the total SiO2 content and SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of metapelite. Metasomatism also decreases Na2O/K2O, CaO/MgO and Fe2O3/FeO ratios of low-grade metapelites.-J.M.H.","Central Geological Survey, MOEA, P.O.B. 968, Taipei, Taiwan., Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,,3,1.0,,,,NA NA,,,Article,,,Memoir of the Geological Society of China (Taiwan),4,,scopus,,,X

The poikiloblastic and anhedral characteristics of the granitic garnet megacrysts suggest that these are not primary garnets crystallized directly from magma, whereas the aplitic and pegmatitic garnet are of magmatic origin. The metamorphic garnet in this area was recrystallized under P-T conditions above those of the garnet zone. Garnet and coexisting biotite were analysed and profile-scanned with an automated microprobe. Chemical compositions of these minerals suggest that the protolith of the granitic gneiss is granodiorite. The garnets in the granitic gneiss exhibit weak and reverse chemical zoning, implying that they once were homogeneous in the magmatic stage and have become zoned in later retrograde metamorphism.

1984.0,Memoir of the Geological Society of China (Taiwan),Mineral chemistry of metamorphosed oceanic rocks in the Yuli belt of the Tananao schist Taiwan,Lan C;Liou J,"Extensively recrystallized metamorphosed mafic-ultramafic rocks of oceanic affinity occur sporadically in the basement complex of the Central Range, Taiwan. They are mostly concentrated in the vicinity of Wanjung, Juisui and Yuli. At least three metamorphic episodes have been identified: 1) pre-Cainozoic, subduction-related high-P epidote-amphibolite-facies metamorphism; 2) late Cainozoic subduction-related blueschist/greenschist-facies metamorphism; and 3) Plio-Pleistocene collisional greenschist-facies metamorphism. Compositional variations in amphibole have been correlated with the different metamorphic facies. Barroisitic hornblende, Na-amphibole/Al-actinolite and low Al-actinolite are respectively characteristic of each stage. However, the later two stages of recrystallization occurred at very similar T but at different P, and such difference did not modify compositions of epidote and white mica. Epidotes which crystallized during the epidote amphibolite-facies metamorphism contain lower pistacite components (Ps 0.2-6.5) than those of the later greenschist-facies metamorphism (Ps 11.7-28.3). White micas produced during the epidote amphibolite-facies metamorphism are paragonite whereas those of the greenschist-facies metamorphism are phengite and muscovite. The distribution of Na/K, Na/Ca, Fe/Altotal and Fe/Mg between coexisting pairs of plagioclase, calcic amphiboles, epidote, white micas and chlorite are discussed. In general, observed partitionings suggest a close approach to chemical equilibrium, and more marked element fractionation in the later greenschist-facies recrystallization than that in the epidote amphibolite-facies metamorphism.

However, an earlier retriangulation was made in 1971 in an area of some 180 km2 immediately SW of Hualien on the east coast of the island.

The Coastal Range is probably not now moving as a huge thrust mass or as a strike-slip giant block, but is dislocated into many longitudinal fault blocks by internal differential movements. Each block may move as a thrust block or a wrench-fault block, or both. Hence, the movement pattern of the Coastal Range today is not represented simply by one dominant tectonic style, but is a compression + shearing version, on which thrust tectonics are overprinted with sinistral wrench-fault tectonics, particularly in the northern half of the range.-J.M.H.","Geology Dept., Chinese Culture Univ., Yangmingshan, Taiwan 113., Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,,1,1.0,,,,NA NA,,,Article,,,Memoir of the Geological Society of China (Taiwan),4,6,scopus,,,X

Large plagioclase and amphibole crystals are ubiquitous in these nodules, with clinopyroxene, mica, epidote, spinel phases and ilmenite in various proportions. Interstitial felsic minerals, including high-K zeolites, low-Ca plagioclase and sanidine, also occur in some Lutao and Lanhsu nodules, which may represent phases crystallized from intruded liquid in the later stage.

Apparent ages of 90-80 m.y. for the amphibolites and epidote-amphibolites may represent the age of the main metamorphic stage. Muscovites from pegmatites have apparent ages ranging 86-72 m.y. which may indicate the period of emplacement of gneisses and of numerous pegmatitic dykes, linked to a local anatexis contemporaneous with the regional metamorphism or later. Hornblendic gneisses and coarse-grained biotites from pegmatites and K-metasomatized migmatites yield ages approx 60 m.y. (younger than muscovite ages and possibly due to lower Ar retentivity). A subsequent cooling episode accompanied by deformation and retrograde metamorphism ensued, lasting until the late Eocene (35 m.y.). Fine-grained biotites from the gneisses outcropping in the Tungao-Nanao and Tailuko-Chipan areas yield ages of 35 and 9 m.y., respectively. The 12 and 10 m.y. ages on phengites from glaucophane schist in the Yuli belt suggest that the collision of the Eurasian continental plate with the Luzon arc took place in the late Miocene. -J.M.H.","Central Geological Survey, P.O.B. 968, Taipei, Taiwan., Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,,2,1.0,,,,NA NA,,,Article,,,Memoir of the Geological Society of China (Taiwan),28,7,scopus,,,X

This requires a 2-stage process: quality control of meteorological data and spatial interpolation of climate data. For this article, unscreened metadata and observed data were collected from all stations in Taiwan for the period 1961-2002. A quality-control procedure based on a geographic information system (GIS) allowed us to reject 13.5% of stations because of missing or erroneous metadata and filter out 8.3% of the observed data because of extreme errors or unreasonable temporal sequence and spatial patterns. After applying the quality-control procedure, the monthly mean temperature and total monthly precipitation were calculated as spatial interpolation sampling points. We evaluated the performance of 6 kriging-based spatial interpolation methods with regard to their errors by cross-validation. For interpolating the monthly mean temperature, the strong relation between temperature and elevation led us to favor modified residual kriging. For interpolating the total monthly precipitation, log-transformed kriging was chosen for practical reasons (steadier and simpler). We compared our product layers with pre-existing climate layers.

Fluid overpressure can affect earthquake nucleation(1,2) and in a process termed thermal pressurization, pore fluid pressure produced by frictional heating can reduce the effective normal stress acting on the fault surface(3-5). This may lead to a marked reduction in fault strength during slip. However, the coseismic presence of fluids within slip zones and the role of fluids in dynamic fault weakening is still a matter of debate. Here we present compositions of major and trace elements as well as isotope ratios of core samples representing relatively undamaged as well as very fine-grained deformed material from three active zones of the Chelungpu fault, Taiwan. Depth profiles across the most intensely sheared bands that range in thickness from 2-15 cm exhibit sharp compositional peaks of fluid-mobile elements and of strontium isotopes. We suggest that high-temperature fluids (>350 degrees C) derived from heating of sediment pore fluids during the earthquake interacted with material within the fault zone and mobilized the elements. The coseismic presence of high-temperature fluids under conditions of low hydraulic diffusivity(6) within the fault zone is favourable for thermal pressurization. This effect may have caused a dynamic decrease of friction along the Chelungpu fault during the 1999 magnitude 7.6 Chi-Chi earthquake.","Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Kochi Inst Core Sample Res, Kochi 7838502, Japan.;  Marine Works Japan Ltd, Kochi 7838502, Japan.;  Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Earth & Space Sci, Osaka 5600043, Japan.;  Kobe Univ, Res Ctr Inland Seas, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.;",JAPAN;JAPAN;JAPAN;JAPAN;TAIWAN,JAPAN,JAPAN,13,5.0,0.0,"Ishikawa, T (corresponding author), Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Kochi Inst Core Sample Res, 200 Monobe Otsu, Kochi 7838502, Japan.",,,,10.1038/ngeo308,Article,1999 CHI-CHI; 21 SEPTEMBER; PORE-FLUID; SLIP ZONE; TAIWAN; EARTHQUAKE; BEHAVIOR,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,NATURE GEOSCIENCE,100,1,ISI,KOCHI INST CORE SAMPLE RES;OSAKA UNIV;KOBE UNIV;NATL TAIWAN UNIV,KOCHI INST CORE SAMPLE RES,B2
2008.0,Nat. Geosci.,Tropicalcyclonedriven erosion of the terrestrial biosphere from mountains,Hilton R;Galy A;Hovius N;Chen M;Horng M;Chen H,"The transfer of organic carbon from the terrestrial biosphere to the oceans via erosion and riverine transport constitutes an important component of the global carbon cycle(1-4). More than one third of this organic carbon flux comes from sediment-laden rivers that drain the mountains in the western Pacific region(3,5). This region is prone to tropical cyclones, but their role in sourcing and transferring vegetation and soil is not well constrained. Here we measure particulate organic carbon load and composition in the LiWu River, Taiwan, during cyclone-triggered floods. We correct for fossil particulate organic carbon using radiocarbon, and find that the concentration of particulate organic carbon fromvegetation and soils is positively correlatedwith water discharge. Floods have been shown to carry large amounts of clastic sediment(6). Non-fossil particulate organic carbon transported at the same time may be buried offshore under high rates of sediment accumulation(7-9). We estimate that on decadal timescales, 77-92% of non-fossil particulate organic carbon eroded from the LiWu catchment is transported during large, cyclone-induced floods. We suggest that tropical cyclones, which affect many forested mountains within the Intertropical Convergence Zone(10), may provide optimum conditions for the delivery and burial of non-fossil particulate organic carbon in the ocean. This carbon transfer is moderated by the frequency, intensity and duration of tropical cyclones.","Univ Cambridge, Dept Earth Sci, Cambridge CB2 3EQ, England.;  Taroko Natl Pk Headquarters, Hualien 972, Taiwan.;  Minist Econ Affairs, Water Resources Agcy, Taipei 10651, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.;",UNITED KINGDOM;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,UNITED KINGDOM,UNITED KINGDOM,6,2.0,2.0,"Hilton, RG (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Earth Sci, Downing St, Cambridge CB2 3EQ, England.",UK Natural Environmental Research Council (NERC)UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); Cambridge Trusts,This work was supported by the UK Natural Environmental Research Council (NERC) and The Cambridge Trusts.

2014.0,Nat. Geosci.,River gorge eradication by downstream sweep erosion,Cook K;Turowski J;Hovius N,"Rivers can respond to local surface uplift or depositional blockage by incision of a narrow channel, but the resulting gorges are often temporary features. Although fluvial downcutting, channel narrowing and gorge formation have been studied over a range of conditions, the eradication of bedrock gorges and the transformation of an incised gorge into a broad floodplain are poorly understood and have not been documented in a natural river. Here we mapped channel width using aerial photographs and Lidar data from 2004 to 2010 of the Daan River bedrock gorge in Taiwan-formed in response to coseismic uplift in 1999-to evaluate mechanisms of gorge eradication. We identify a mechanism, which we term downstream sweep erosion, that is rapidly transforming the gorge into a bevelled floodplain through the downstream propagation of a wide erosion front located where the broad upstream channel abruptly transitions into a narrow gorge. We estimate that gorge erosion will remove the uplifted topography in as little as 50 years. We suggest that downstream sweep erosion can remove bedrock gorges, impose local valley widths based on upstream conditions, remove evidence of tectonic activity or depositional river blockages and therefore complicate the interpretation of channel morphology in terms of tectonic or climatic forcing.","GFZ German Res Ctr Geosci, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.;  Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland.;",GERMANY;TAIWAN;SWITZERLAND,GERMANY,GERMANY,3,2.0,1.0,"Cook, KL (corresponding author), GFZ German Res Ctr Geosci, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany.","NSCMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [2811-M-002-092]; SNF [200021_132163/1]","K.L.C. received support from NSC grant 2811-M-002-092 and from postdoctoral supervisor J.

Whereas silicate weathering removes carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, weathering of accessory carbonate and sulfide minerals is a geologically relevant source of CO2. Although these weathering pathways commonly operate side by side, we lack quantitative constraints on their co-variation across erosion rate gradients. Here we use stream-water chemistry across an erosion rate gradient of three orders of magnitude in shales and sandstones of southern Taiwan, and find that sulfide and carbonate weathering rates rise with increasing erosion, while silicate weathering rates remain steady. As a result, on timescales shorter than marine sulfide compensation (approximately 10(6)-10(7) years), weathering in rapidly eroding terrain leads to net CO2 emission rates that are at least twice as fast as CO2 sequestration rates in slow-eroding terrain. We propose that these weathering reactions are linked and that sulfuric acid generated from sulfide oxidation boosts carbonate solubility, whereas silicate weathering kinetics remain unaffected, possibly due to efficient buffering of the pH. We expect that these patterns are broadly applicable to many Cenozoic mountain ranges that expose marine metasediments.","GFZ German Res Ctr Geosci, Potsdam, Germany.;  Univ Potsdam, Inst Geosci, Potsdam, Germany.;  NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD USA.;  Colorado State Univ, Dept Geosci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.;  Univ Lorraine, CNRS, Ctr Rech Petrograph & Geochim, Nancy, France.;  Univ Texas Austin, Jackson Sch Geosci, Austin, TX 78712 USA.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei, Taiwan.;",GERMANY;GERMANY;USA;USA;FRANCE;USA;TAIWAN,GERMANY,GERMANY,7,7.0,2.0,"Bufe, A (corresponding author), GFZ German Res Ctr Geosci, Potsdam, Germany.",Initiative and Networking Fund of the Helmholtz Association; EU Marie Sklodowska-Curie Research Fellowship [841663]; ETH Fellowship; Alexander von Humboldt FellowshipAlexander von Humboldt Foundation,"This research was enabled by resources from the Initiative and Networking Fund of the Helmholtz Association.

Over the past two decades there has been a dramatic improvement in our understanding of the diagenetic changes experienced by ancient bones and the impact of those changes on preserved information, although the identity of the organisms responsible for microbial degradation remains something of a mystery. Because of the long timescales involved, the damages seen in bones excavated from archaeological and fossil sites have proved difficult to replicate in the laboratory. Field experiments in a tropical location (Taiwan) have successfully replicated the early stages of many of the features seen in genuinely ancient bones and these changes can be linked to specific burial environments. These key diagenetic signatures are shown to persist in fossil bones over millions of years and can be identified in electron microscope images of histological sections. Thus, investigation the histology of fossil bones using backscatter electron microscopy (BSEM) is a useful addition to other techniques, e.g. rare earth element analyses, in understanding the diagenetic histories of fossil assemblages.","Natl Yunlin Univ Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Cultural Heritage Conservat, Touliu, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,NORWAY,1,1.0,,"Turner-Walker, G (corresponding author), Univ Bergen, Univ Museum Bergen, Postboks 7800, N-5020 Bergen, Norway.",,,Fossil bones; diagenesis; bioerosion; BSEM; EDX; cyanobacteria; bacterial tunnelling,10.1127/0077-7749/2012/0253,Article; Proceedings Paper,BONE-EATING WORMS; ARCHAEOLOGICAL BONE; TAPHONOMIC HISTORY; DIAGENESIS; MIOCENE; OSEDAX; TRACES; WHALE; MICROBORINGS; DESTRUCTION,E SCHWEIZERBARTSCHE VERLAGSBUCHHANDLUNG,NEUES JAHRBUCH FUR GEOLOGIE UND PALAONTOLOGIE-ABHANDLUNGEN,36,265,ISI,NATL YUNLIN UNIV SCI AND TECHNOL,UNIV BERGEN,A

2020.0,Open Geosci.,Landslide site delineation from geometric signatures derived with the HilbertHuang transform for cases in Southern Taiwan,Yang S;Liao J;Pan Y;Shih P,"Landslides are a frequently occurring threat to human settlements. Along with global climate change, the occurrence of landslides is the forecast to be even more frequent than before. Among numerous factors, topography has been identified as a correlated subject and from which hillslope landslide-prone areas could be analyzed. Geometric signatures, including statistical descriptors, topographic grains, etc., provide an analytical way to quantify terrain. Various published literature, fast Fourier transform, fractals, wavelets, and other mathematical tools were applied for this parameterization. This study adopts the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) method to identify the geomorphological features of a landslide from topographic profiles. The sites of the study are four ""large-scale potential landslide areas"" registered in the government database located in Meinong, Shanlin, and Jiasian in southern Taiwan. The topographic mapping was conducted with an airborne light detection and ranging instrument. The resolution of the digital elevation model is 1m. Each topographic profile was decomposed into a number of intrinsic mode function (IMF) components. Terrain characterization was then performed with the spectrum resulting from IMF decomposition. This research found that the features of landslides, including main scarp-head, minor scarp, gully, and flank, have strong correspondence to the features in the IMF spectrum, mainly from the first and the second IMF components. The geometric signatures derived with HHT could contribute to the delineation of the landslide area in addition to other signatures in the terrain analysis process.","Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Hsinchu, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,4,1.0,1.0,"Liao, JJ (corresponding author), Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Hsinchu, Taiwan.","Forest Bureau, Council of Agriculture, Taiwan; Ministry of Science and Technology, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 108-2625-M-009-007-MY2]","The authors thank Prof. Norman Huang, for providing the software for HHT analysis.

2021.0,Open Geosci.,Prediction of total landslide volume in watershed scale under rainfall events using a probability model,Wu C;Chou P,"This study established a probability model based on the landslide spatial and size probabilities to predict the possible volume and locations of landslides in watershed scale under rainfall events. First, we assessed the landslide spatial probability using a random forest landslide susceptibility model including intrinsic causative factors and extrinsic rainfall factors. Second, we calculated the landslide volume probability using the Pearson type V distribution. Lastly, these probabilities were joined to predict possible landslide volume and locations in the study area, the Taipei Water Source Domain, under rainfall events. The possible total landslide volume in the watershed changed from 1.7 million cubic meter under the event with 2-year recurrence interval to 18.2 million cubic meter under the event with 20-year recurrence interval. Approximately 62% of the total landslide volume triggered by the rainfall events was concentrated in 20% of the slope units. As the recurrence interval of the events increased, the slope units with large landslide volume tended to concentrate in the midstream of Nanshi River subwatershed. The results indicated the probability model posited can be used not only to predict total landslide volume in watershed scale, but also to determine the possible locations of the slope units with large landslide volume.","Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Soil & Water Conservat, 145 Xingda Rd, Taichung 402, Taiwan.;  Taipei Feitsui Reservoir Adm, Deputy Commissioner Off, New Taipei 231, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,1.0,"Wu, CY (corresponding author), Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Soil & Water Conservat, 145 Xingda Rd, Taichung 402, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and Technology, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 106-2313-B-005-027]","This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, under Grant No. MOST 106-2313-B-005-027.",landslide probability model; Uchiogi empirical model; total landslide volume; standard deviational ellipse,10.1515/geo-2020-0284,Article,CHI-CHI EARTHQUAKE; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; RANDOM FOREST; RIVER-BASIN; HAZARD; TAIWAN; MAPS; IMPACT,DE GRUYTER POLAND SP Z O O,OPEN GEOSCIENCES,0,13,ISI,NATL CHUNG HSING UNIV;TAIPEI FEITSUI RESERVOIR ADM,NATL CHUNG HSING UNIV,B2

The experiments, conducted using 15 humic or shaly coals, two boghead coals, and eight source rock samples from Taiwan, Turkey, North America, and Australia, show that the technique has potential to distinguish oil-prone coals from gas-prone coals. The oil potential of humic coals was estimated from the amounts of total liquid generated during pyrolysis, which show correlations with the Hydrogen Index (HI) from Rock-Eval pyrolysis and the gas-to-oil ratio (GOR) determined by Py-GC analysis. The changes of visual area (or volume) of neoformed liquid as a function of temperature at four heating rates were used to calculate the extents of kerogen-to-oil transformation for determining the kinetic parameters. The results confirm the kinetic controls on the measured transformations but reveal unusually high apparent activation energies and frequency factors. The use of this technique as a quantitative tool to predict oil generation kinetics should be treated with caution until this discrepancy has been resolved. In addition, this study has demonstrated that the expulsion of oil-like liquid from coals is generally more efficient than from shales, possibly due to the much higher organic content in coal.

The concentration profile of perylene with sediment age fits a first order kinetic model, which might be an indication of a steady sedimentary environment. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

2021.0,Org. Geochem.,Carbon and hydrogen isotope fractionation during aerobic oxidation of shortchain alkanes in experimental incubations of vent fluids,Chen X;Schmidt M;Chen C;Duan W;Jin A;Chen C;Ye Y,"Aerobic oxidation of short-chain alkanes was observed in gas samples from the Lutao intertidal hydrothermal vents in Taiwan, during storage at 20 degrees C for up to 29 months without adding bacterial strains and replenishing substrates. The carbon isotope fractionation factors (epsilon(C)) of methane (C-1), ethane (C-2), and propane (C-3), were calculated using the Rayleigh fractionation equation to be -37.1 +/- 7.5 parts per thousand, -14.8 +/- 4.8 parts per thousand, and -4.7 +/- 5.2 parts per thousand, respectively. The hydrogen isotope fractionation factor (epsilon(H)) of methane was determined to be -281 +/- 187 parts per thousand. DNA sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene in the vent fluids suggests that aerobic oxidation is dominated by methanotrophs of the genera Methylomicrobium and Methylophaga, which use the ribulose monophosphate pathway (RuMP). The degrees of isotope fractionation (epsilon(C) and epsilon(H) values) herein are larger than previously reported values, possibly due to the limited O-2 supply and low abundance of aerobic methane-oxidizing bacteria in the experiments. Since the fractionation factor of methane is higher than those of ethane and propane, the aerobic oxidation of thermogenic or microbial alkanes could produce a carbon isotope reversal, which is frequently noted as a trait of abiotic hydrocarbons. This work demonstrates that in addition to anaerobic microbial oxidation, aerobic oxidation with a low cell density can also produce significant isotope fractionation of alkanes in geological closed/semi-closed environments and open flow reaction systems that are characterized by moderate temperatures and a limited supply of substrates and O-2; these environments include cold seeps, mud volcanoes, and low-temperature hydrothermal plumes/aquifers/reservoirs.

1989.0,PAGEOPH,Temporal variation of coda Q during Hualien earthquake of 1986 in eastern Taiwan,Wang J;Teng T;Ma K,"The May 20, 1986, Hualien earthquake sequence occurred on the northeastern coast of Taiwan. The M=6.1 (GS mb) mainshock was followed by a large number of closely-clustered aftershocks with the largest being an M=5.5 event. One seismic station, TWD of the Taiwan Telemetered Seismographic Network, is located in the surface projection of the source region and provides excellent recordings of the entire earthquake sequence. These recordings, plus events occurring in the same source area preceding the mainshock, offer a unique opportunity to study the spatial and temporal variations of coda Q in a region of active subduction. A simple technique is devised that uses the envelope of the coda waveform to enable a quick determination of the coda Q from drum records. For recordings with a peak power at about 8 Hz, the following findings have been obtained: 1. The ambient coda Q near an active subduction region was as low as 145; 2. There was no significant decrease in coda Q within the period beginning one year and four months prior to the mainshock; 3. There was a significant drop of coda Q immediately after the mainshock; this drop lasted approximately two days before returning to the ambient level; 4. Coda Q values varied with focal depth. © 1989 Birkhäuser Verlag.","Institute of Earth Sciences, Academia Sinica, P.O.

Cluster and non-metric multi-dimensional scaling (NMS) analyses were conducted using data from eight localities. Six fossil assemblages are recognized, with some overlap between them: Planktic Foraminifera (PF), Benthic Foraminifera (BF), Encrusting Foraminifera (EF), Bryozoan-Echinoderm-Algae-Mollusk (BEAM), Algae (A), and Coral (C) assemblages. The first two major axes of the NMS analysis can be interpreted as primarily representing water depth and substrate type. These assemblages represent various shallow marine settings with low to moderately high biodiversity. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. and Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, CAS.

1997.0,Paleogeogr. Paleoclimatol. Paleoecol.,Cenozoic basins in northern Taiwan and tectonic implications for the development of the eastern Asian continental margin,Yu H;Chow J,"North of Taiwan, four offshore Tertiary basins extend seaward from the inner shelf of the East China Sea to the west of the Okinawa Trough. These basins are characterized by rifting features with NE-SW-trending half-grabens and fault blocks. Episodic rifting events have taken place from Paleocene to Early Miocene with the eastward shift of depositional centers. The Paleogene rift basins are filled primarily with lacustrine to shallow marine sediments, but also contain a slight amount of pyroclastics and basaltic flows. Regional subsidence has dominated during the late Tertiary and these Paleogene half-grabens have united into a large marginal sea basin overlain by a Neogene sedimentary wedge of shallow marine sediments. A fifth basin, the Paleogene Hsuehshan half-graben trough in present-day northern Taiwan has been deformed into mountain ranges by the collision of the Luzon Are with the eastern Asian margin during the late Cenozoic Era. The tectonic development of eastern Asian margin in northern Taiwan region has evolved into two phases. First, the eastward retreat of the West Pacific subduction zone and accompanied rifting of continental crust occurred during Late Cretaceous to Eocene times. Second, as the intensity of rifting decreased; thermal subsidence of eastern Asian margin prevailed and subsequently caused a tilting seaward continental margin on which a large marginal sea basin rests. Collision of the Luzon Are with the eastern Asian margin in Taiwan deformed the Paleogene Hseuhshan Trough into mountain ranges (Late Miocene to present). (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

2003.0,Paleogeogr. Paleoclimatol. Paleoecol.,The dry Holocene Megathermal in Inner Mongolia,Chen C;Lan H;Lou J;Chen Y,"The paleoclimate since 14 kyr BP (C-14 age) was reconstructed based on a 16.22-m-long sediment core collected from Lake Yanhaizi, a saline lake located near the northern limit of the East Asian summer monsoon in Inner Mongolia. Coarse sediments were deposited there during a shrinkage phase of the lake when sand dunes reactivated. These sediments have low organic carbon contents but high maturity indices, indicating that they were deposited in an and environment. By contrast, based on high organic contents and low maturity indices, fine sediments were deposited during periods of high lake stand in a humid environment. It was in general dry between 8.0 and 4.3 kyr BP. The above dry and wet phases are consistent with those recovered from the arid-semiarid transition zone elsewhere, but are unlike the widely perceived humid Holocene Megathermal reported in east China and the newly reconstructed record in the alpine Retreat Lake in Taiwan. The discrepancy may be due to a relative insensitivity to humidity changes in these two areas since they have both been under the total influence of the summer monsoon. On the other hand, much enhanced evaporation over higher monsoon precipitation at Lake Yanhaizi reduces the effective humidity in the warm climate near the northern boundary of the summer monsoon. This also accounts for the fact the high-temperature Holocene Megathermal, as revealed in the Okinawa Trough and the northern South China Sea, is correlated to the dry phases at Lake Yanhaizi. Conversely, the 4-2-kyr BP coldest period in the Holocene corresponds to a wet phase at Lake Yanhaizi. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

2010.0,Paleogeogr. Paleoclimatol. Paleoecol.,Late Quaternary vegetation and climate changes inferred from a pollen record of Dongyuan Lake in southern Taiwan,Lee C;Liew P,"A pollen record sampled from a valley basin in southern Taiwan shows the environmental change specifically vegetation and climate that has occurred there since 22,000 cal.yr BP. In contrast to the subtropical evergreen forest found there today, temperate broadleaved and conifer mixed forest occupied the basin between 22,000 and 16,000 cal.yr BP, which suggests that climate conditions were considerably cold during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and early deglacial period. During the interval from 16,000 to 11,400 cal.yr BP, this basin was situated near an ecotone of two altitudinal vegetation zones, i.e. a temperate conifer, broadleaved mixed forest and a warm-temperate evergreen forest, which suggests the gradually warming climate conditions of the late-glacial period. The climate experienced further warming between 11,400 and 8200 cal.yr BP, as evidenced by the dominance of warm-temperate evergreen forest elements. Subsequently, the subtropical evergreen forest prevailed in the basin between 8200 and 4100 cal.yr BP, which reflects a considerably warmer mid-Holocene. In addition, tropical evergreen forest appeared in the area circa 6100 cal.yr BP, marking the Holocene Thermal Optimum (WO). Following that, a warm-temperate evergreen forest thrived between 4100 and 2100 cal.yr BP. Finally a subtropical evergreen forest began its reemergence in the basin from 2100 cal. yr BP and continues to grow there today. From a comparison of these changes in vegetation, we propose that 1) the annual mean temperature of the LGM was at least 7 degrees C lower than today and 2) the HTO was at least 2 degrees C higher than present.

2016.0,Paleogeogr. Paleoclimatol. Paleoecol.,Lacustrine record of centennial and millennialscale rainfall variability of the East Asian summer monsoon during the last deglaciation Multiproxy evidence from Taiwan,Ding X;Zheng L;Li D;Yang T;Lee T;Kao S,"Situated at the border between the Southeast Asian continent and the northwestern Pacific, Taiwan's climate is primarily influenced by the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) and episodic tropical cyclones formed in the western Pacific. The lake sediments in Taiwan thus potentially archive the information of typhoon events and past monsoon variability. A high-resolution multi-proxy (total carbon, mass accumulation rate of total carbon, weight percent of wood fragments, delta C-13 of the organic carbon, magnetic susceptibility, chemical weathering index) and well-dated lacustrine record from Dongyuan Lake (22 degrees 10'N, 120 degrees 50'E; 360 m above sea level) in southern Taiwan was used to reconstruct centennial to millennial timescale EASM oscillations specifically for the transition from the last deglaciation to the Early Holocene (17-9 ka BP). The temporal patterns of proxies on both timescales in our records broadly agree with those in the Greenland ice core, which shows enhanced EASM during the warm period and weakened monsoon during the cold period. Different from northern high-latitude climates, we found two phases in the Mystery Interval, opposite Bolling-Allerod (BA) trend with maximum monsoonal rainfall in the Allerod period and more gradual transition to Younger Dryas event in our record. Likely, other climate forcings beyond the North Atlantic climate jointly modulated the EASM. Changes of sea surface temperature in the western tropical Pacific also might have exerted synergistic control on EASM precipitation in Taiwan on the centennial timescale during the last deglaciation. In addition, several high sedimentation events accompanied by significant amounts of wood fragments were observed and coincide with the paleo-record of mass wasting events identified on various downstream floodplains in Taiwan. Since mass wasting processes were rainfall-driven and threshold-triggered, such coherence possibly indicated an intensification of typhoon activity during the early Holocene. More high-resolution lacustrine records are required to decipher the hydrological variation and climate dynamics that were co-influenced by the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and typhoon activity in Southeast Asia.

2022.0,Paleogeogr. Paleoclimatol. Paleoecol.,Climatedriven drainage reorganization of small mountainous rivers in Taiwan East Asia since the last glaciation The Zhuoshui River example,Zhang S;Jian X;Liu J;Wang P;Chang Y;Zhang W,"As an important component in East Asia sediment source-to-sink systems, small mountainous rivers in Taiwan deliver disproportionately large amounts of sediments to oceans. Although the modern fluvial sediment transport processes, discharge fluxes and sediment compositions have been well investigated, the drainage evolution of these mountainous rivers remains understudied and sediment fluxes are expected to vary greatly in glacialinterglacial cycles due to the tremendous climatic fluctuations. To define how the drainage of Taiwan mountainous rivers has evolved since the last glaciation, we target a sediment core (98 m in length) from the Zhuoshui River delta, western Taiwan and conduct sediment petrography, heavy mineral analysis, detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology and clay mineralogy to investigate provenance variations and river basin evolution since 60 ka. Sediments of the last glaciation show comparatively high illite crystallinity index values, low metasedimentary lithic fragment and stable heavy mineral contents and similar detrital zircon U-Pb ages with downstream signatures, indicating prominent sediment contributions from the Coastal Plain and Western Foothills regions (elevation 1 km) during the glaciation. However, characteristics of the deglacial and Holocene sediments indicate high contributions from the higher Hsueshan Range and Central Range regions (elevation 1 km). We suggest that headward extension and drainage capture since the deglaciation, which was most likely due to the increasing monsoon rainfall, account for the provenance variations in the discharged sediments. This implies a climate-driven drainage reorganization of the small mountainous rivers in Taiwan since the last glaciation. Our findings highlight the previously-overlooked, variable provenance information from Taiwan in glacialinterglacial cycles, and the dynamic source signatures are important to East Asia sediment source-to-sink studies.","Nanjing Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr South China Sea Studies, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;  Xiamen Univ, Coll Ocean & Earth Sci, State Key Lab Marine Environm Sci, Xiamen 361102, Fujian, Peoples R China.;  Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Oceanog, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.;  Nanjing Normal Univ, Sch Geog, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;  Jiangsu Ctr Collaborat Innovat Geog Informat Reso, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;",CHINA;CHINA;TAIWAN;CHINA;CHINA,CHINA,CHINA,6,3.0,2.0,"Jian, X (corresponding author), Xiamen Univ, Coll Ocean & Earth Sci, State Key Lab Marine Environm Sci, Xiamen 361102, Fujian, Peoples R China.","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41806052]; Natural Science Foundation of Fujian ProvinceNatural Science Foundation of Fujian Province [2017J05067]; Xiamen University Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [20720190097, 20720190103]; ROC Ministry of Science and Technology [NSC 99-2611-M-110-005, NSC 100-2611-M-110-013]","This work was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41806052), Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province (2017J05067) and Xiamen University Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (20720190097 and 20720190103).

2014.0,Paleontol. Res.,Quaternary fossil gray whales from Taiwan,Tsai C;Fordyce R;Chang C;Lin L,"Two specimens of fossil juvenile gray whale from the sea bottom between Taiwan and the Penghu Islands are Quaternary in age, and probably early Holocene, no older than 11-12 ka. Both specimens preserve the posterior portion of the skull from the occipital condyles to the broken frontals; the earbones are missing. A key diagnostic feature of eschrichtiids, paired tuberosities on the supraoccipital, occurs in both specimens. Because of incompleteness and differences with the living gray whale, the fossils are designated as Eschrichtius sp. rather than Eschrichtius robustus. This report of fossil gray whales is the first from Taiwan. The fossils expand the known range of Quaternary gray whales, and this occurrence of juveniles is consistent with a possible paleo-breeding- or nursery range.","Univ Otago, Dept Geol, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand.;  Tunghai Univ, Dept Life Sci, Taichung 407, Taiwan.;  Natl Museum Nat Sci, Dept Geol, Taichung 404, Taiwan.;",NEW ZEALAND;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,NEW ZEALAND,NEW ZEALAND,4,2.0,2.0,"Tsai, CH (corresponding author), Univ Otago, Dept Geol, POB 56, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand.",University of Otago Doctoral Scholarship,"We especially thank Chi-Tang Chen and Li-Jen Hou who provided these two new specimens for study, LFMM-W-001 and NMNS-F051728, respectively.

2015.0,Photogramm. Rec.,Dem Measurements of A GravelBed Surface Using Two Scales of Images,Wang C;Chung J;Lin Y,"Determining the geometry of an exposed gravel-bed surface is important in understanding river flow characteristics. This study presents a method of generating a digital elevation model (DEM) of exposed gravel-bed surfaces using two different scales of images of a riverine environment. The small scale DEM covers an area of 45m x 45m and serves as the reference base, whereas several large scale DEMs provide highly detailed elevation information along the site diagonals. The equipment includes a consumer-grade camera and is light and easy to set up in the field. Highly automated procedures using several off-the-shelf packages ease the burden of generating DEMs of the gravel-bed surface, reducing the technological obstacles for other disciplines. This study evaluates the accuracy of the proposed method at three study sites with different grain sizes along the Hou-Jue River in southern Taiwan. The elevation accuracy obtained by the proposed method was validated by a total station and achieved a root mean square error of 29 to 43mm.","Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Geomat, Tainan 701, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,,"Wang, CK (corresponding author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Geomat, Tainan 701, Taiwan.","National Science Council of TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [NSC100-2628-E-006-015]",The authors thank Chung-Hsing Surveying Co.

C. raciborskii was present in the pond throughout the study, and its abundance was positively correlated with water temperature. The net growth rates of C. raciborskii displayed no clear seasonal pattern, whereas the highest value (0.184 d_1) was observed in early July when the water temperature sharply increased to the annual highest level. The rapid growth of C. raciborskii led to bloom formation, which persisted over the summer months (July and August). Dilution and washout of trichomes by rainfall significantly affected the dynamics of C. raciborskii, including leading to the termination of a bloom. © The Plankton Society of Japan.","Research Center for Environmental Changes, Academia Sinica, 128, Sec. 2, Academia Rd, Taipei, 11529, Taiwan",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,,"Yamamoto, Y.; Research Center for Environmental Changes, Academia Sinica, 128, Sec. 2, Academia Rd, Taiwan",,NA NA NA,Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii;  Net growth rate;  Rainfall;  Seasonal dynamics;  Temperature,10.3800/pbr.8.68,Article,abundance;  artificial ecosystem;  cyanobacterium;  freshwater ecosystem;  growth rate;  persistence;  pond;  seasonal variation;  shallow water;  water temperature; Taiwan; Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii,Plankton Society of Japan,Plankton and Benthos Research,8,8,scopus,ACADEMIA SINICA,ACADEMIA SINICA,A

Among phylogenetically diverse MOB, those of the phylum Proteobacteria have been regarded as major methane oxidizers in environments, and they are classified into two major groups, type I and type II. Another group of MOB, `Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera' and its close relatives have also been detected in various environments, but their predominance over proteobacterial MOB has hardly ever been reported. Feitsui Reservoir (FTR) is a subtropical reservoir situated in Taiwan, where the predominance of 'M. oxyfera'-like phylotypes in a planktonic MOB community was first reported. In this study, planktonic MOB of three types ('M. oxyfera'-like, type I and type II) were quantified with catalyzed reporter deposition-fluorescence in situ hybridization, to reveal seasonal variation and vertical distribution in the FTR. The MOB were enumerated for 161 samples obtained from 8 water depths on 23 sampling days over 16 months. The results obtained in this study will provide valuable basic data for a better understanding of MOB communities in the environment, giving insights into the global methane budget.","Acad Sinica, Res Ctr Environm Changes, 128 Acad Rd,Sect 2, Taipei 115, Taiwan.;  Hokkaido Univ, Inst Low Temp Sci, Kita Ku, Kita 19,Nishi 8, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600819, Japan.;  Kyoto Univ, Ctr Southeast Asian Studies, Sakyo Ku, 46 Shimoadachi Cho, Kyoto 6068501, Japan.;  Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, 2-509-3 Hirano, Otsu, Shiga 5202113, Japan.;  Yamaguchi Univ, Grad Sch Med, Ube, Yamaguchi, Japan.;  Res Inst Humanity & Nat, Kyoto, Japan.;",TAIWAN;JAPAN;JAPAN;JAPAN;JAPAN;JAPAN,TAIWAN,JAPAN,6,1.0,,"Kojima, H (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Inst Low Temp Sci, Kita Ku, Kita 19,Nishi 8, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600819, Japan.",,,,,Article,OXIDATION,PLANKTON SOC JAPAN,PLANKTON & BENTHOS RESEARCH,2,11,ISI,ACAD SINICA;HOKKAIDO UNIV;KYOTO UNIV;KYOTO UNIV;YAMAGUCHI UNIV;RES INST HUMANITY AND NAT,HOKKAIDO UNIV,A

Coexisting sphene, zircon, and apatite show markedly, though narrowly, discordant ages, which decrease in the order: sphene, zircon, and apatite. No evidence of the thermal imprint after the last metamorphic event has been found in these rocks. The cooling of the rocks now exposing on the surface is interpreted in terms of uplift and erosion. Taking the effective geological track-retention temperatures for apatite, zircon and sphene as 135+ or -20oC, 235+ or -50oC and 285+ or - 50oC respectively, average present surface temperature of 20oC and a geothermal gradient of 30oC/km, the average cooling and uplift rate of each temperature range can be calculated for the Central Range. -Author","Dept of Geol, National Taiwan Univ, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C., Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,,1,1.0,,,,NA NA,,,Article,,,Proceedings - Geological Society of China,77,25,scopus,,,X

The Pihou phyllite together with the Tananao schist (including the Kiyoku gneiss) have been deformed into an overturned anticlinorium with the vergence toward the NW. The hinge of the anticlinorium passes just through the Kiyoku gorge where the Kiyoku gneiss is exposed. In the field, it is observed that the so-called M-conglomerate is the basal conglomerate of the Pihou phyllite which overlies the Kiyoku gneiss unconformably.

In the Takeng section, from lower to upper, Taxodiaceae-Fagaceae Zone, Taxodiaceae Zone, Pinus-Taxodiacceae-Castanopsis Zone, Pinaceae I Zone and Castanopsis Zone are recognized, while in the Chuhuangkeng section Pinaceae II Zone, Taxodiaceae Zone, Pinus-Taxodiaceae-Castanopsis Zone, Pinaceae I Zone and Castanopsis Zone are assigned. The similarity of the succession of pollen zones with that of the Chishan section in southern Taiwan provides the possibility of correlation. Through this correlation as well as the possible approximation of ages of the prominent cold stages in early Brunhes Paleomagnetic Epoch, the age of the Molasse of the Toukoshan Formation could be approached.

These sediments are divided into five formations based on the difference in lithology and lithic sequence. Several new local stratigraphic units are proposed for these formations in accordance with the code of stratigraphic nomenclature. From Oligocene to Pliocene the depositional basins of this region successively received sediments well over 4000m in thickness, and the water depth was in the order of 0 to 200m. As a result of the Penglai Orogeny, during Plio-Pleistocene time, the deposition in the basin was interrupted, the whole basin was uplifted to form a mountain belt and the sedimentary sequence was thus folded, faulted and metamorphosed.

The outcrop area of the schist has been divided into the Tailuko and the Yuli belts (Yen, 1963). The Tienhsiang, Changchun and Chiuchu Formations of the Tailuko belt (Wang Lee, 1979, 1982) constitute a subduction/collision complex. The tectonic movement responsible for these formations probably occurred from the late Permian to middle Jurassic. This stage of tectonism was also responsible for the prevalence of calc-alkaline continental-margin type igneous activity of 160-190 Ma in Southeast China. A second stage constitutes the Yuli belt. The Tailuko belt became the site of low-pressure type metamorphism during this stage. Lastly, the Tananao Schist has been overprinted by the late Tertiary-Pleistocene metamorphism. -from Authors","Institute of Earth Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,,3,1.0,,,,NA NA,,,Article,Cenozoic;  Mesozoic;  subduction;  Tananao Schist;  tectonic history;  tectonic reconstruction; Taiwan,,Proceedings - Geological Society of China,12,31,scopus,,,X

The data set includes about 500 earthquakes. The travel time variations of P and S waves along the different paths in the different directions are studied. It is found that the path transverse to the structural axis of Taiwan island has apparently lower traveling velocity than that parallel to the axis. The S wave traveling velocity is low for the path shorter than 200km. It implies that shallow layers of low velocity exist in the upper crust, which may constitute a good condition for trapping the Lg wave. The Qs values for the 4 regions of Taiwan are found to be 1) W foothill and coastal plain: 110, 2) S central mountain range: 180, 3) N central mountain range: 200, and 4) E coastal mountain range: 150.

Bouguer anomaly data were used to determine the subsurface structures of this area. The results indicate that the Nankan fault is a normal fault. Its total vertical displacement is about 150 m. The fault plane of the Taoyuan fault is nearly vertical. The hinge character of this fault is recognized from the Bouguer map. The Hsinchuang fault strikes in the NE-SW direction with a dipping angle of about 35o SE. A temporary seismographic network with 9 stations was deployed to study the seismicity of the area. 49 events with magnitudes between 0.9 and 3.8 were located in the study area during the survey period of 43 days. Most of them were in depths shallower than 25 km and in the SE of Taoyuan city. Some earthquakes occurred very close to the Hsinchuang fault. It is noted that the Hsinchuang fault may be active. 427 earthquakes in the study area were collected by the Taiwan Telemetered Seismographic Network (TTSN) during the period of 1973-1985. Their distribution pattern is quite similar to that revealed by the temporary array.

However, the regional compressions might yield influence to some extent.

These zones are first recognized in the shallow marine to brackish water sediments of the Chishan and Napalin sections in southern Taiwan. Pollen zones of, or younger than, the last interglacial stage are integrated by the palynological studies of the lake deposits of Jih-Yueh Tan and Waichiataokeng, central Taiwan. In the foothills of northwestern and/or west-central Taiwan, the early Pleistocene shallow marine sediments of the Cholan and Toukoshan Formations were continuously deposited till middle Pleistocene, whilst in the Tainan area, the Pleistocene shallow marine to brackish water sediments were continuously deposted probably up to the last integlacial age. The land area of proto-Taiwan was greatly enlarged after the distinct deformation phase in the middle Pleistocene, probably about 0.4Ma. Following this, major sea level fluctuations become important in modifying the sedimentation pattern or geomorphological processes in the coastal area of proto-Taiwan. A subdued topography was formed prior to the major lateritic weathering phase in late Pleistocene.

The earthquake in question is the Taipingshan, Taiwan earthquake (M=5.7) of May 10, 1983. The duration ratios obtained from foreshocks increased two days before the mainshock.

The duration ratios immediately decreased after the mainshock. Overestimation of the total durations of coda waves at the close-in station due to mixture of seismograms of group of events might result in the decrease.

1989.0,Proceedings - Geological Society of China,Fault creep on the central segment of the Longitudinal Valley Fault eastern Taiwan,Shui-Beih Y S;Chi-Ching L C,"The NNE-trending Longitudinal Valley Fault (LVF) in eastern Taiwan is widely considered an active collision boundary between the Philippine Sea and the Eurasian plates. In order to monitor its faulting activities, three trilateration networks and five short leveling routes across the central segment of the LVF were deployed and surveyed frequently during 1983-1988. Rapid vertical crustal movements were detected at several places from the repeated survey data. The eastern side of the LVF (i.e. the Coastal Range) is steadily uplifting relative to its western side (i.e. the Central Range) at rates of 10-20 mm/yr. All five locations of possible surface traces of the LVF identified from the repeated leveling data are aligned on an approximately straight line consistent with that delineated from the geological and geomorphological data. Furthermore, since no appreciable earthquake activity was detected in this area during the past few years, the vertical movements discovered are mainly aseismic. We conclude that the 50 km long central segment of the LVF, extending from Juisui south to Chihshang, is creeping significantly with both vertical and horizontal motions. -from Authors","Inst. of Earth Sciences, Academia Sinica, P.O.Box 23-59, Taipei, Taiwan, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,,2,1.0,,,,NA NA,,,Article,aseismic;  creep;  crustal movement;  faulting;  geodetic survey;  plate boundary; Longitudinal Valley Fault;  Taiwan,,Proceedings - Geological Society of China,71,32,scopus,,,X

This survey covers an area of about 260 km2. The Bouguer anomaly map is relatively simple. Except for some closed gravity low areas near Hsinkang, most contours of the map trend in the NNW-SSE direction. The anomaly more or less decreases gradually from the WSW to the ENE. This implies that the strata in this area is likely to dip to the northeast. The distribution patterns of residual and second derivative Bouguer anomalies show some specific characteristics which indicate the possibility of the westward extension of the Meishan fault from Minghsiung. -from Authors","Institute of Earth Sciences, Academia Sinica, PO Box 23-59, Taipei, Taiwan, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,,4,1.0,,,,NA NA,,,Article,Bouguer anomaly map;  fault detection;  gravity survey;  Meishan fault; Minghsiung-Peikang area;  Taiwan,,Proceedings - Geological Society of China,0,32,scopus,,,X

Century long records exist in many places of the world and several decades of observations are available in some places of Taiwan. In this study, the records of six tide stations in Taiwan are used to estimate the vertical crustal deformation at each station. The Fugung station records yield a secular trend of -24.5 mm/yr most probably related to the rapid uplift of the Coastal Range. On the other hand, a secular trend of +27.8 mm/yr at the Taisi station in western Taiwan is interpreted as the result of local subsidence owing to ground water withdrawal. -from Author","Institute of Earth Sciences, Academia Sinica, PO Box 23-59, Taipei, Taiwan, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,,1,1.0,,,,NA NA,,,Article,crustal deformation;  sea level;  sea level observation;  tide gauge record;  uplift;  vertical crustal deformation; Taiwan,,Proceedings - Geological Society of China,4,32,scopus,,,X

The source parameters of the initial rupture which were determined through moment tensor inversion using the first 25 seconds of P waves are: strike 70°, dip 55°, rake 90°, and a seismic moment 6.85 × 1025 dyne-cm. The focal depth is 20 km from the arrival times of surface reflection, sP in short-period seismograms. The source time function includes two successive triangular pulses of 4 second duration. This implies a subevent occurred 4 seconds after the initial rupture. The distribution of aftershocks and the results of moment tensor inversion show that the second subevent was probably located at a depth of 10 km in a zone between two groups of aftershocks.

Together with the Taiwan-Luzon suture zone, it has accommodated a large amount of the strain caused by the left-handed wrench-tectonic movement in the region. The characteristic structural features of this zone include a confined virgation of splay faults, north-directed thrusts produced by transcurrent buckling, and small but significant fault-wedge basins, all indicating that the upthrusts inside and alongside it act also as sinistral wrench faults. Since it has received a large amount of strike-slip motion in Taiwan, and since it extends along a zone of intra-plate subduction, the Yushan-Hsuehshan Zone distinguishes itself from the two other tectonic elements of the Foreland Fold-and-Thrust Belt in the island's framework, the Central Range and the foothills.

The δD and δ18O values of creek waters show a linear decrease with increasing altitude up to 1500m. Samples from geothermal wells in the Chingshui and adjacent Tuchang fields have considerably lower δD values, by about 20‰, than the local river and creek waters, indicating that the recharge area for the geothermal waters lies above 1000m in altitude. The thermal waters in the Central Range province are deep-circulated meteoric waters driven by the hydraulic pressure due to high recharge altitudes. The oxygen isotope shift of the geothermal water is no greater than 3‰. The small isotope shift probably results from the difficulty of reaction between water and rock due to low permeability of the slate formation.

Utilizing the most suitable partition coefficients for REE in clinopyroxene- and amphibole-basalt systems to delineate the compositions of melts from which they may have crystallized, we found that the melts conform very well with the compositions of alkali basaltic magmas in western Taiwan.

The difference in distribution and facies pattern between the Miocene and Paleogene sequences clearly demonstrates that the Paleogene basin was a half-graben trough sloping from the Kuanyin Uplift and bordered by an offshore basement high represented by the Backbone Range. The trough was filled up by terrigenous sediments derived from the China continent in the Early Miocene and was buried by sheet-like Miocene deposits that transgressed the continental margin. -from Authors","Dept. of Geology, National Taiwan Univ., Taipei, Taiwan, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,,1,1.0,,,,NA NA,,,Article,facies variation;  sedimentary basin;  stratigraphy;  tectonic evolution;  Tertiary; Hsuehshan Trough;  Taiwan,,Proceedings - Geological Society of China,57,34,scopus,,,X

The results show that all samples are high in Na2O content and δ18O value. The variations between LREE and HFSE among samples, however, indicate that these elements may have been immobile during alteration/metamorphism. Two metamorphosed andesites, with lower Na2O content and δ18O value are suggested to be least altered among all samples studied. There are two amphibolite bodies, occurring south of the metamorphosed andesite/dacite, in the Tungao area.

The matrix is generally composed of plagioclase microlites and smectite, as identified by XRD. Major- and trace-element analyses of six basalt samples are presented, and their average composition is compared with three other alkali basalts from Taiwan and the Philippine Sea.

XRD shows that these secondary minerals are thomsonite, tobermorite and calcite, in order of decreasing abundance. XRD data for two samples of thomsonite and two of tobermorite are presented, with chemical compositions. The basaltic rock has suffered from different degrees of palagonitization, during which SiO2, Al2O3, CaO, and Na2O were leached out from the glass, and presumably concentrated in the pore solution. An average bulk composition for these leached components in the pore solution is presented. The bulk composition of the secondary materials agrees fairly well with that leached out from the basaltic glass, though slightly poor in SiO2 and Al2O3 and rich in Na2O. The formation of these secondary minerals is evidently closely related to the alteration of basic glass to palagonite; the crystallization of the secondary minerals occurred at very low T. -P.Br.","Inst. of Geology, National Taiwan Univ., Taiwan., Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,,2,1.0,,,,NA NA,,,Article,,,Proceedings of the Geological Society of China (Taiwan),0,24,scopus,,,X
1981.0,Proceedings of the Geological Society of China (Taiwan),Island arc system of the Coastal Range eastern Taiwan,Teng L;Wang Y,"This range is generally regarded as the northern extension of the Luzon arc system. Stratigraphically, five rock units can be distinguished; in younging order, these are the Tuluanshan andesitic volcanic rocks and limestones; the Fanshuliao volcanogenic bioclastic flysch; the Lichi melange; the Paliwan lithic flysch and conglomerate; and the Pinanshan conglomerate. The first three units can be grouped as the pre-collision island-arc lithofacies, and the last two as the syn- and post-collision continental lithofacies. Through a comparison of the pre-collision arc-trench settings of the Coastal Range with those of modern intraoceanic arcs, the Tuluanshan formation can be correlated with the island-arc volcanic rocks, the Lichi formation with the trench melange and the Fanshuliao formation with the arc-trench gap sequence. This arc sequence took shape in the Early to Middle Miocene and collided with the China continental margin in the Middle Pliocene. From then on, continent-derived detritus dominated in the Paliwan formation and the Pinanshan conglomerate.

Garnet in the inner zone occurs as large, idioblastic crystals; in the outer zone it appears as smaller euhedral crystals.

The effect of the first fold generation, F1, was the metamorphic differentiation of quartz-rich and mica-rich layers. F2 represents the strongest deformation period in this area, reaching the biotite zone of greenschist metamorphism. F3 is characterized by the development of medium-tight parallel folds without significant metamorphic crystallization. After F3, there was a static crystallization phase with T reaching the biotite zone of greenschist facies. The F4 fold generation gave rise to open, post-metamorphic and flexure-slip folds with a NW fold axis.

The present study was undertaken to establish a better understanding of the relations between CZ and nephrite, and of the criteria for nephrite exploration. Samples were collected from 11 adits in the nephrite mining area and subjected to mineralogical and chemical analysis, with special attention to mineral development vs distance from the nephrite ore-body, and the ore-forming environment represented by the minerals present. It is concluded that CZ is the product of the alteration of black shales by Ca-bearing hydrothermal solutions. CZ can be used as an indicator for nephrite exploration because nephrite is likely to develop only when CZ is present, and good quality nephrite is more likely to occur around CZ that is brecciated or contains tremolite and/or diopside. CZ could also be one of the precursors of diopsidefels, which is known to be closely related to nephrite in spatial distribution.

The chemical compositions of dacites from Chilungshan, Penshan and Tsaoshan are similar, indicating that they belong to the same petrographic province. Chinkuashih dacites are chemically similar to Keelungtao dacites although the former have slightly higher Ca and Rb but lower Si, Al, Na and Sr contents. The MgO- SIGMA FeO- (Na2O + K2O) plots for Chinkuashih dacites fall in an area between the Tatun and Coastal Range andesites and show no sign of Fe enrichment. In Chinkuashih dacites SiO2, Al2O3, Na2O and K2O increase while MgO decreases with decreasing S.I. values. SIGMA FeO, CaO, TiO2 and MnO are relatively constant over all the S.I. values, which vary from 24.07-33.54.

Tsaolingshan absarokites have higher K, Mg, Ni, Cr, Rb and Ba contents than Penghu alkali basalts and Kuanyinshan shoshonitic rocks, but lower Ca, Al, Fe and Ti contents. They also have relatively higher K2O/Na2O, Mg/(Mg + Fe2+) but much lower K/Rb ratios. The higher Ni, Cr, Mg/(Mg + Fe2+) values indicate possible derivation from a primary alkali basaltic magma. SiO2 and K2O increase while FeO, MgO, MnO, TiO2, Ni, Li, Zn, Sr and ign. loss decrease with decreasing solidification index. The AFM plots fall in a small area and show no sign of Fe enrichment. Chemical characteristics indicate that crystal fractionation of olivine + or - clinopyroxene from the primary alkali basalt magma may have occurred.

Its most striking feature is a very high content of incompatible trace elements, such as Rb, Sr and Ba. Since SiO2 is relatively higher and Ni and Cr lower than the common andesites of the area, these rocks could have solidified from a more acidic magma than the Kuanyinkeng volcanics overall. The andesitic dyke rocks could possibly be a mixture of two components - the relatively uncontaminated 'hypersthene andesite' in the area and the amphibole-rich plutonic cumulates underneath.

Amphibolite or epidote amphibolite-facies metamorphism, deduced from relict mineral compositions of the green rocks, might not have occurred in the Tananao terrain but rather represents an ocean-floor hydrothermal metamorphic episode.

1986.0,Proceedings of the Geological Society of China (Taiwan),Copper and gold mineralizations in the Chinkuashih area northern Taiwan,Chen C,"Cu and Au mineralizations of the Chinkuashih area are associated with several late-Pliocene-Pleistocene dacite-andesite intrusions. The ore minerals, with enargite and luzonite in the central Penshan intrusion and native gold, galena, sphalerite and tetrahedrite in the surrounding intrusions, clearly show horizontal zoning. Similarly, the fact that Au is in general more enriched in the upper levels and Cu becomes more important in the lower levels, indicates the likely existence of vertical zoning too. However, both zonings have exceptions. The distribution of the ore minerals in the area is accounted for by the variations in T, pH and chemical activity of both metal and anion ions associated with the hydrothermal solutions. Sulphur isotope data indicate that the hydrothermal solutions were of both magmatic and meteoric origin. Extensive alterations and octahedral pyrite crystal form suggest that large amounts of water were involved in the hydrothermal mineralization process. -J.M.H.","Dept. of Earth Sciences, National Chang Kung Univ., Tainan, Taiwan., Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,,1,1.0,,,,NA NA,,,Article,,,Proceedings of the Geological Society of China (Taiwan),0,29,scopus,,,X

Laboratory-selected malathion- and isoprocarb-resistant, and all field strains, showed surprisingly high permethrin resistance while remaining susceptible to fenvalerate. Detoxication, mediated by esterases, was associated closely with malathion resistance and, to a lesser extent, with resistance to several other organophosphorus compounds. Insensitive acetylcholinesterase was primarily responsible for isoprocarb resistance, and it also contributed to the resistance to some other carbamates. A follow-up survey indicated that brown planthopper was highly resistant to permethrin with only low or moderate resistance to alpha -cyano-containing pyrethroids, cypermethrin, deltamethrin and fenvalerate.

2014.0,Radio Sci,Meteor radar wind over ChungLi 249N 121E Taiwan for the period 1025 November 2012 which includes Leonid meteor shower Comparison with empirical model and satellite measurements,Su C;Chen H;Chu Y;Chung M;Kuong R;Lin T;Tzeng K;Wang C;Wu K;Yang K,"The neutral winds in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) region are measured by a newly installed meteor trail detection system (or meteor radar) at Chung-Li, Taiwan, for the period 10-25 November 2012, which includes the Leonid meteor shower period. In this study, we use the 3 m field-aligned plasma irregularities in the sporadic E (Es) region in combination with the International Geomagnetic Reference Field model to calibrate the system phase biases such that the true positions of the meteor trails can be correctly determined with interferometry technique. The horizontal wind velocities estimated from the radial velocities of the meteor trails and their locations by using a least squares method show that the diurnal tide dominates the variation of the MLT neutral wind with time over Chung-Li, which is in good agreement with the horizontal wind model (HWM07) prediction. However, harmonic analysis reveals that the amplitudes of the mean wind, diurnal, and semidiurnal tides of the radar-measured winds in height range 82-100 km are systematically larger than those of the model-predicted winds by up to a factor of 3. A comparison shows that the overall pattern of the height-local time distribution of the composite radar-measured meteor wind is, in general, consistent with that of the TIMED Doppler Interferometer-observed wind, which is dominated by a diurnal oscillation with downward phase progression at a rate of about 1.3 km/h. The occurrences of the Es layers retrieved from fluctuations of the amplitude and excess phase of the GPS signal received by the FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC satellites during the GPS radio occultation (RO) process are compared with the shear zones of the radar-measured meteor wind and HWM07 wind. The result shows that almost all of the RO-retrieved Es layers occur within the wind shear zones that favor the Es layer formation based on the wind shear theory, suggesting that the primary physical process responsible for the Es layer events retrieved from the scintillations of the GPS RO signal is very likely the plasma convergence effect of the neutral wind shear. ©2014.

1991.0,Radio Sci.,THE INVESTIGATIONS OF THE ATMOSPHERIC PRECIPITATIONS BY USING CHUNGLI VHF RADAR,CHU Y;CHIAN L;LIU C,"In this paper the results of precipitation observed by Chung-Li VHF radar during the passage of typhoon Susan through the Taiwan area on June 2, 1988, are presented. We find that VHF radar can not only observe the falling speed of the rain drops but can also detect that of the ice particles. The observational results show that the former is about 6-8 m/s, while the latter is about 1 m/s, consistent with those observed by the conventional Doppler meteorological radar. The echo power due to precipitation is generally far smaller than that due to atmospheric refractivity fluctuations. However, it is enhanced strikingly at the height of melting layer (about 5 km in Taiwan area), and its value can be greater than that due to refractivity fluctuations by about 5 dB. Moreover, it also shows that the feature of bright band only occurs in the echo power profile of precipitation, and it cannot be observed in that of atmospheric refractivity. The echo power profiles of the vertical and oblique beams (with zenith angle 17-degrees) are also examined. They indicate that there is no aspect sensitivity for the echoes scattered from the atmospheric refractivity fluctuations during the precipitating environment. However, for the echo power of precipitation the feature of aspect sensitivity does exist above the melting layer and disappears below this altitude. The correlation between the horizontal wind speed and the Doppler spectral width of precipitation is found to be fairly high, with a correlation coefficient of 0.86. This suggests that the beam-broadening effect due to the advection of horizontal wind may be one of the important factors contributed to the precipitation spectral width and has to be taken into consideration when the precipitation spectra are analyzed.","UNIV ILLINOIS,DEPT ELECT COMP ENGN,URBANA,IL 61801.;",,,TAIWAN,3,,,"CHU, YH (corresponding author), NATL CENT UNIV,INST ATMOSPHER PHYS,CHUNGLI,TAIWAN.",,,,10.1029/91RS00830,Article,DOPPLER RADAR; SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS; ASPECT SENSITIVITY; AIR; SCATTERING; MECHANISMS; MOTIONS,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,RADIO SCIENCE,23,26,ISI,UNIV ILLINOIS,NATL CENT UNIV,A
1994.0,Radio Sci.,THE SEVERE DEPLETION OF TURBULENT ECHO POWER IN PRECIPITATION OBSERVED USING THE CHUNGLI VHF DOPPLER RADAR,CHU Y;LIN C,"Earlier investigations of atmospheric precipitation made with a VHF radar demonstrate that below the level of melting (i.e., 0 degrees C isotherm) the VHF echo intensities from precipitation particles are generally much weaker than those from turbulent refractivity fluctuations by about 20-30 dB. However, in this article, using Chung-Li VHF radar data, the precipitation echoes in the height range from about 2.5 to 4 km, which is below the melting level during the season of spring over the Taiwan area, may far exceed the turbulent returns in intensity by about 15 dB, contradicting earlier observations. A comparison of the echo power profiles of the precipitation with those of refractivity fluctuations reveals that the weak backscatter from refractivity can be attributed to abnormally severe depletion of turbulent echo power in a convective cloud with fairly intense upward air motion and moderate precipitation. Furthermore, the correlation between hydrometeor terminal velocity and precipitation echo power is positive, while the air motion and turbulent echo power are anticorrelated. On the basis of these observations a plausible mechanism is proposed to explain the abnormal depletion of refractivity echo power.",,,,TAIWAN,2,,,"CHU, YH (corresponding author), NATL CENT UNIV,INST SPACE SCI,CHUNGLI 32054,TAIWAN.",,,,10.1029/94RS01163,Article,ASPECT SENSITIVITY; LOWER STRATOSPHERE; TAIWAN; TROPOSPHERE; FRONT; AIR,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,RADIO SCIENCE,25,29,ISI,,NATL CENT UNIV,A
1995.0,Radio Sci.,CHARACTERISTICS OF LIGHTNING ECHOES OBSERVED WITH VHF ST RADAR,ROTTGER J;LIU C;PAN C;SU S,"The development of tropospheric convection was observed with the Chung-Li VHF stratosphere-troposphere (ST) radar in Taiwan, Republic of China. Deep convection evolved into thunderstorms during which radar echoes from lightning were recorded with a particular high time resolution program. These lightning echoes usually exist for only several tens to a few hundred milliseconds. To investigate the fine structure in the amplitude and phase of the lightning returns, the necessary time resolution has to be in the order of a few milliseconds. Such time resolutions are for the first time applied with VHF ST radar and the initial results are presented in this paper. Rapid jumps in the phase path were occurring together with sudden amplitude changes. This indicates that the scattering regions change their position, which could be on different branches of the lightning stroke. Large radial velocities of the lightning scattering regions up to several tens of meters per second were observed. Also, strong velocity shears were noticed in these lightning echo regions. Power peaks in Doppler spectra corresponding to velocities of about 300 m s(-1) were occasionally detected. It is contemplated that these are caused by Bragg scattering from sound waves resulting from the lightning shock wave. Also a periodic velocity and amplitude modulation of a thin sheet of radar reflectivity was observed which one could attribute to infra-sound with a frequency of about 6-7 Hz. Preliminary conclusions are drawn finally to confirm that our observations are generally consistent with backscatter from lightning.","NATL CENT UNIV,CHUNGLI 32054,TAIWAN.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,SWEDEN,4,1.0,,"ROTTGER, J (corresponding author), EISCAT SCI ASSOC,POB 812,S-98128 KIRUNA,SWEDEN.",,,,10.1029/95RS00648,Article,DOPPLER RADAR; PLASMA,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,RADIO SCIENCE,8,30,ISI,NATL CENT UNIV,EISCAT SCI ASSOC,A

2002.0,Radio Sci.,Studies of 195 GHz sky radiometric temperature Measurements and applications,Shih S;Chu Y,"[1] Using a single-frequency ground-based microwave radiometer with steerable horn antenna at frequency 19.5 GHz, we measure sky radiometric temperature over the Taiwan area during the period May 1997 to September 1999. Statistics indicate that for more than 80% of the time, in the absence of surface precipitation, the brightness temperature is above 27 K. Different elevation angle observations show that the median brightness temperature increases with decreasing elevation angle from about 30 K at zenith to about 128 K at 80degrees off-zenith angle. The opacity (or gaseous attenuation) is also estimated from measured brightness temperature. We found that the elevation angle variation of the median value of opacity follows exactly the secant law, while that of opacity with other probability does not. The mean radiated temperature T-m over the Taiwan area is also calculated using 5 years of radiosonde data, showing that T-m is a function of elevation angle and its value at 10degrees elevation angle is greater than that at zenith by 0.5-1.3%. A method of retrieving integrated precipitable water vapor content (IPWV) from the observed brightness temperature measured by a single-frequency radiometer at 19.5 GHz is developed and examined. Comparing the retrieved and measured IPWVs shows a good agreement between them, validating the method proposed in this article. The correlation between 19.5 GHz radiometric opacity and 52 MHz wind profiler backscatter from clear-air sky is also analyzed. The result shows that the correlation will be negative if the vertical distribution of the wind profiler backscatter is characterized by salient layered structures. Therefore great caution should be taken when radiometric measurements are incorporated with wind profiler backscatter to retrieve the humidity profile.","Natl Cent Univ, Ctr Space & Remote Sensing Res, Inst Space Sci, Chungli 32054, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,,"Shih, SP (corresponding author), Natl Cent Univ, Ctr Space & Remote Sensing Res, Inst Space Sci, Chungli 32054, Taiwan.",,,microwave radiometer; brightness temperature; precipitable water vapor content; wind profiler; atmospheric attenuation,10.1029/2000RS002596,Article,MICROWAVE RADIOMETER; WATER-VAPOR; CLEAR AIR; ECHOES; TROPOSPHERE; STRATOSPHERE; FREQUENCIES; PROFILES; HUMIDITY; LIQUID,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,RADIO SCIENCE,1,37,ISI,NATL CENT UNIV,NATL CENT UNIV,A

These results are useful in investigation of N(e)ar-Earth space and large-scale N(e) distribution with diurnal and seasonal variations, along with geographic features such as the equatorial anomaly (EA).

With the Earth's magnetic field and horizontal N-e gradient effects included, efficient methods for calculating ray parameters such as the ground range, reflection height, phase path, and group path are presented. The three-dimensional TWIM consists of vertically fitted alpha-Chapman-type layers, with distinct F2, F1, E, and D layers, for which the layer parameters such as peak density, peak density height, and scale height are represented by surface spherical harmonics. This way the continuity of N-e and its derivatives is maintained. This is important for practical schemes for providing reliable radio propagation predictions. The methodology is successfully applied to a practical high-frequency transmitter for oblique incidence ray tracing and further evaluated by comparing synthetic vertical ionograms generated by the method with experimental ionosonde observations.","Natl Cent Univ, Ctr Space & Remote Sensing Res, Chungli 320, Taiwan.;  Acad Sinica, Taipei 115, Taiwan.;  Natl Cent Univ, Inst Space Sci, Chungli 320, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,,"Tsai, LC (corresponding author), Natl Cent Univ, Ctr Space & Remote Sensing Res, Chungli 320, Taiwan.",[98-NSPO(B)-IC-FA07-01(I)]; [NSC98-2111-M-008-013-MY3]; [NSC97-2111-M008-008-024-MY2],"This work has been supported by projects 98-NSPO(B)-IC-FA07-01(I), NSC98-2111-M-008-013-MY3, and NSC97-2111-M008-008-024-MY2.",,10.1029/2010RS004359,Article,HF,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,RADIO SCIENCE,15,45,ISI,NATL CENT UNIV;ACAD SINICA;NATL CENT UNIV,NATL CENT UNIV,A

For the timing laboratories, it is necessary to calibrate and periodically evaluate their time transfer system to ensure the accuracy and long-term stability of their time and frequency comparison results. Once the calibration is achieved, it can be used as a standard for traceable time and frequency measurements. In this paper, we demonstrate Global Navigation Satellite System receiver calibration campaign between the National Time and Frequency Standard Laboratory of Telecommunication Laboratories in Taiwan and the Measurement Standards Laboratory in New Zealand. Two calibration strategies, receiver calibration and the link calibration, are adopted in this work. The receiver calibration is used for evaluating the performance of the proposed system in domestic traceability network in Taiwan. The link calibration is used for minimizing the total uncertainty budget in calculating UTC. Experimental results indicate that the expanded time and frequency uncertainty of the proposed system (with a coverage factor of k=2) are less than 25ns and 1.1 x 10(-13), respectively, after 1day of averaging.

Drift characteristics during quiet periods have been examined in details and compared with the drift recorded during 08 September 2017 geomagnetic storm. Analysis of the recorded observations indicated a strong dependence of VHF scintillation on the solar activity level. Equinoctial asymmetry in the occurrence of VHF scintillation was seen in 2015 and 2016. However, such asymmetry was not apparent in 2017(low solar flux). Quiet period spaced receiver drift indicated a gradual reduction in the zonal drift of irregularities between postsunset and postmidnight period. Intriguingly, the average quiet period drift of irregularities was found to be independent of solar activity level. A few investigations in recent past have already reported similar observations and can be generally attributed to the polarization process inside equatorial plasma bubbles; however, a definite explanation for this behavior is not available. During the active phase of the 08 September 2017 geomagnetic storm, a complex interplay of disturbance dynamo and prompt penetration electric field was observed in the spaced receiver derived drift velocity of ionospheric irregularities. Approximately -200% deviation from quiet period drift was observedduring this moderate storm. A significant enhancement to the spaced receiver derived characteristic random velocity, V-c, was also seen during the active phase of storm, which indicates that the drift of irregularities was highly turbulent.","Natl Cent Univ, Ctr Space & Remote Sensing Res, Taoyuan, Taiwan.;  Air Force Res Lab, Space Vehicles Directorate, Albuquerque, NM USA.;  Boston Coll, Inst Sci Res, Boston, MA USA.;",TAIWAN;USA;USA,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,6,1.0,,"Joshi, LM (corresponding author), Natl Cent Univ, Ctr Space & Remote Sensing Res, Taoyuan, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, R.O.C.Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 106-2111-M-008-019]; AFRL/AOARD grant [FA 2386-18-1-0115]","The work was supported by grant MOST 106-2111-M-008-019 from the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, R.O.C.

1995.0,Radiocarbon,Estimating flow and recharge rates of groundwater in western Taiwan using radiocarbon and tritium,Liu T,"The Choushuichi alluvial-fan delta is the largest groundwater system in Taiwan. The coastal area of this fan delta has recently suffered severe land subsidence and sea-water intrusion due to overpumping of groundwater. To study the hydrogeological character of proper water-resource management, an intensive program of geological and water monitoring through well drilling and sampling has been undertaken. At present, radiocarbon dating and/or tritium analysis for samples from >70 boreholes has been completed. The clearly defined position of ''bomb-tritium front'' allows the groundwater flow and recharge rates of the confined aquifer to be calculated with confidence at <10 m yr(-1) and 9.0 x 10(8) m(3) yr(-1), respectively. The flow velocities of the confined aquifer have also accelerated remarkably due to much pumping during the last decades.",,,,TAIWAN,1,,,"Liu, TK (corresponding author), NATL TAIWAN UNIV,DEPT GEOL,245 CHOUSHAN RD,TAIPEI 10770,TAIWAN.",,,,10.1017/S0033822200031027,Article; Proceedings Paper,CARBON; DISPERSION; EVOLUTION; INDICATOR,UNIV ARIZONA DEPT GEOSCIENCES,RADIOCARBON,8,37,ISI,,NATL TAIWAN UNIV,A
2013.0,Radiocarbon,LOWTEMPERATURE AND TEMPERATURE STEPPEDCOMBUSTION OF TERRACE SEDIMENTS FROM NANFU TAIWAN,Wang S;Burr G;Chen Y;Lin Y;Wu T,"We discuss a radiocarbon study of sediment samples collected from Nanfu terrace in western Taiwan. From these, we extracted humic acids (HA) and humin from the very fine and coarse grain-size fractions using a standard acid-alkali-acid pretreatment. The humin extracts were combusted at 400 and 1100 degrees C by stepped-combustion, to yield a low-temperature (LT) carbon component and a high-temperature (HT) carbon component. We compare the ages of the LT and HT humin fractions to the HA fractions, in samples collected at 2 depths within the Nanfu terrace. As in previous stepped-combustion studies on sediments, we find that the HA ages are the youngest on average, and overlap the LT ages, and that the carbon contained in the HT fraction is always distinctly older than the LT and HA ages. To better understand the relationship between C-14 age and combustion temperature, we conducted an incremental stepped-combustion experiment with one of the samples (1E) using 50 degrees C steps that ranged from 300 to 1100 degrees C. The C-14 results of the stepped-combustion products show a clear division between 2 isotopically identifiable carbon constituents, from carbon released below 400 degrees C and carbon released above 550 degrees C. By comparing the. delta C-13 and C-14 results, we find evidence for a third carbon isotopic component in the humin that is released when combusted at similar to 500 degrees C.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Univ Arizona, Dept Phys, NSF Arizona AMS Lab, Tucson, AZ USA.;",TAIWAN;USA,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,5,1.0,1.0,"Wang, SL (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei, Taiwan.",Central Geological Survey [5226902000-02-95-01]; National Taiwan UniversityNational Taiwan University; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [EAR0929458],"We thank Ling-Ho Chung and Yu-Ting Kuo for their assistance in fieldwork, and Dr Chi-Yu Lee for XRD measurement in Taiwan.

2016.0,Radiocarbon,Historical reconstruction of submarine earthquakes using 210PB 137CS and 241AM turbidite chronologyand radiocarbon reservoir age estimation off East Taiwan,Dezileau L;Lehu R;Lallemand S;Hsu S;Babonneau N;Ratzov G;Lin A;Dominguez S,"Taiwan is a young and seismically active mountain belt, where a series of strong earthquakes (M&gt;7) have occurred over the past hundred years. Identifying historical earthquakes around Taiwan is a key to better constrain the geodynamic of this active region. Sedimentological and geochemical analyses of surface sediments from one station offshore east Taiwan revealed the presence of coarse-grained layers interpreted as turbidites. The age of these layers have been determined by 210Pb, 137Cs, and 241Am chronology. Dating of the three most recent turbidites provides ages of AD 2001±3, AD 1950±5, and AD 1928±10. The results show striking temporal correspondence of turbidite layers to large (M≥6.8) earthquakes recorded in the region since the 20th century. The chronologies of sediment layers lead us to believe that turbidites resulted from the 2003 Taitung earthquake (M 6.8), the 1951 Chengkong earthquake (M 7.1), and the 1935 Lutao earthquake (M 7.0), respectively. Such a good correlation between turbidites and high-magnitude (M≥6.8) historical and instrumental seismic events suggests that turbidite paleoseismology constitutes a valuable tool for earthquake assessment in the eastern Taiwan margin. Moreover, the modern reservoir radiocarbon age and the regional marine reservoir correction (ΔR) of the Kuroshio Current off Taiwan were estimated by comparing accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) 14C ages with ages derived from corrected 210Pb profiles and historical accounts of identifiable seismic events. Such a determination is important to calibrate the 14C ages of marine materials for accurate comparison of marine and continental geological records. Our calculated mean ΔR value of 232±54 14C yr (n = 2) is higher than its modern value of 86±40 14C yr. This high value can be explained by the presence of local upwelling cells and turbulence in the Kuroshio Current, north of Green Island. These upwelling cells bring 14C-depleted water to the surface, resulting in an increase of the modern ΔR value in this portion of the Kuroshio Current. © 2016 by the Arizona Board of Regents on behalf of the University of Arizona.","Université de Montpellier, Géosciences Montpellier, CNRS, France; LIA ADEPT, NSC-CNRS, Taiwan; Department of Earth Sciences, National Central University, Zhongli, Taiwan; Domaines Oceaniques, IUEM, Brest, France; Université Nice Sophia Antipolis, CNRS, IRD, Observatoire de la Côte d’Azur, Géoazur UMR 7329, 250 rue Albert Einstein, Sophia Antipolis Valbonne, 06560, France",FRANCE;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;FRANCE;FRANCE,FRANCE,FRANCE,8,2.0,1.0,"Dezileau, L.; UMR5243 CC60 UM/CNRS, Place E.

2002.0,Rev. Palaeobot. Palynology,Late Oligocene to early Miocene dinoflagellate cysts from the Kuohsing area central Taiwan,Mao S;Huang C;Lei Z,"Two dinoflagellate assemblages, first defined from the Pearl River Mouth Basin of the South China Sea, occur in the Oligocene-lower Miocene sediments of the Kuohsing area, Taiwan. The older Holnotryblium plectilum-Cordosphaeridium gracile Assemblage (1), characterized by the last occurrence of Chiropteridium lobospinosum, Cordosphaeridium gracile, Homotryblium abbreviatum, Homotryblium tenuispinosum, and Membranophoridium aspinatum, is late Oligocene; the younger Polysphaeridium zoharyi-Lingulodinium machaerophorum Assemblage (11), characterized by the first occurrence of Hystrichosphaeropsis obscura, Melitasphaeridium choanophorum and Tuberculodinium vancampoae, is early Miocene. The dominance/abundance of Polysphaeridium zoharyi in some of the Kuohsing samples suggests that the sediments of this area were deposited on a tropical-subtropical, inner neritic shelf. Slight sea-level fluctuations during the period of deposition reflect two shifts from an outer inner neritic to an inner inner neritic shelf, and ultimately to an inner outer neritic shelf environment at the time of highest sea-level. The present study strengthens previous findings that P. zoharyi is a warm-water indicator restricted to low latitudes, whereas Bitectatodinium tepikiense and Deflandrea are temperate- to cold-water indicators restricted to middle and high latitudes; and, that Nematosphaeropsis labyrinthus and Impagidinium prefer outer neritic/oceanic environments, whereas P. zoharyi prefers a shallow, inner neritic environment.

2018.0,Rev. Palaeobot. Palynology,Seasonal dinoflagellate cyst production and terrestrial palynomorph deposition in the East Asian Monsoon influenced South China Sea A sediment trap study from the Southwest Taiwan waters,Li Z;Pospelova V;Lin H;Liu L;Song B;Gong W,"The South China Sea (SCS), influenced by the tropical East Asian Monsoon (EAM), experiences winter monsoon and summer monsoon shifts in near-surface wind, air temperature, sea-surface temperature, salinity, primary productivity, and other oceanographic conditions. To understand how monsoon seasons influence palynological dynamics and which palynological index could be a reliable indicator of winter or summer monsoons, we studied palynological records of sediment trap samples collected in March-April (winter monsoon season) and July August (summer monsoon season). Fluxes and assemblages of terrestrial pollen and spores, as well as marine dinoflagellate cysts, were investigated using sediment traps in the southwest Taiwan waters of the SCS. The pollen and spores of 109 taxa and dinoflagellate cysts of 53 taxa were identified in 24 sediment trap samples that were collected at 3-day intervals. The average abundance of Pinus pollen was notably higher in March-April at similar to 40%, which was double that in July-August. This trend was associated with transport by the northwest wind in March-April when Pinus pollen are produced by the coniferous vegetation in the South China and Taiwan Island. The pollen abundances of Chenopodiaceae/Amaranthaceae and Compositae seemed to be greatly reduced in July-August, with an opposite pattern observed for Poaceae, Artemisia, Cyperaceae, Typha, and fern spores. Fluvial transport is likely the controlling factor since river runoff intensifies in summer. High relative abundances and fluxes of Poaceae pollen are not indicators of summer monsoons but related to cultivated activities. Dinoflagellate cyst assemblages were dominated by cysts produced by heterotrophic taxa, especially Brigantedinium spp. at 68-91%. Proportionally higher increases than those of cysts produced by autotrophic dinoflagellates resulted in lower heterotrophic to autotrophic ratios in July-August. The highest total cyst fluxes occurred in late July of similar to 20,000 cysts m(-2) d(-1) together with the highest fluxes of autotrophic Operculodinium centrocarpum, Spiniferites spp., and Lingulodinium hemicystum. The increased fluxes of almost all dinoflagellate cyst taxa during July-August were related to the decreased sea-surface salinity (SSS) due to the greater river water inputs and nutrients.

2002.0,River Res. Appl.,Effect of flowrelated substrate alteration on physical habitat A case study of the endemic river loach Sinogastromyzon puliensis Cypriniformes Homalopteridae downstream of ChiChi diversion weir ChouShui Creek Taiwan,Wu F;Wang C,"This paper addresses the variation of substrate status with flow in the framework of habitat simulation. The Physical Habitat Simulation System (PHABSIM) was developed as a tool for water management and has become one of the most popular methods worldwide. Despite its many advantages, the variation of channel properties with flow is not addressed in PHABSIM. We modified PHABSIM by incorporating a sub-program that can perform substrate analyses under five different schemes for evaluating the substrate suitability. These schemes include the conventional methods to specify the substrate attribute (scheme 1) and to use the mean grain size of the original bed material for determining the substrate suitability (scheme 2), or employ the threshold conditions for sediment entrainment to evaluate the nominal grain size of the stable substrate (schemes 3-5). As a case study, Sinogastromyzon puliensis in Chou-Shui Creek (Taiwan) is selected as the target species for the habitat simulation. For schemes I and 2, the substrate attribute specified for each cell of a cross-section does not change with flow. The nominal grain size of the stable armour material (scheme 5) is generally greater than the nominal grain sizes of the above-critical bed material (scheme 3) and the static armour layer (scheme 4). The simulation results indicate that the suitability values specified in scheme I and the resulting habitat area are on the optimistic side, whereas scheme 2 tends to undervalue the suitability of the hydraulically worked substrate. The overall variation trends of the weighted usable area (or percentage usable area) curves for different substrate schemes are similar, especially in the in-phase regions of the water velocity and depth. The results of this study appear to imply that the flow-related habitat analyses are not usually sensitive to substrate.

2004.0,River Res. Appl.,Assessment of Hydrologic Alterations caused by chichi diversion weir in ChouShui Creek Taiwan Opportunities for restoring natural flow conditions,Shiau J;Wu F,"The Range of Variability Approach (RVA) is used to investigate the hydrologic impacts of a diversion weir on Chou-Shui Creek, Taiwan. Thirty-two hydrologic parameters, called Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA), are used to evaluate the flow conditions before and after weir construction. One standard deviation from the mean for each of the pre-construction hydrologic parameters is set as the management target range. Under the prevailing diversion rules, large hydrologic alterations are observed, especially for low flows. The means of 19 hydrologic parameters presently fall outside of the targets and the average non-attainment rate for the 32 indicators is 73.2%. Increasing the instream flow release or reducing diversions could mitigate the hydrologic impacts of weir construction. Increasing the instream flow to 40 m 3 A and reducing monthly water demands by variable percentages significantly improves the altered flow conditions. Under the proposed water release and diversion scheme, 29 hydrologic parameters will fall within the management targets and the average non-attainment rate will be reduced to 35.6%, much closer to the pre-construction value of 25.3%. Restoring the natural flow variability is expected to promote the natural stream biota.

2007.0,River Res. Appl.,A dynamic corridorsearching algorithm to seek timevarying instream flow releases for optimal weir operation Comparing three indices of overall hydrologic alteration,Shiau J;Wu F,"A full range of natural flow regime has been widely recognized as a primary driving force for sustaining the integrity of a riverine ecosystem. Existing instream flow methods strive to assure a constant minimum flow but not the natural flow variability. We present in this paper a dynamic corridor-searching algorithm to seek the optimal time-varying scheme for instream flow releases. A compromise programming (CP) is employed to search the optimal Solution of an objective function aggregating the ecosystem and human needs objectives. The ecosystem need objective is represented by an overall index of hydrologic alteration, which integrates 32 indicators of hydrologic alteration (IHA) derived from the range of variability approach (RVA). The human need objectives are expressed by shortage ratios for the agricultural and municipal water supplies. The proposed method is applied to a weir operation in Taiwan. Three approaches to evaluating the overall degree of hydrologic alteration (i.e., the three-class, fuzzy-based, and overall-mean approaches) are compared here. The results show that the time-varying schemes improve the human need objective, but only slightly deteriorate the ecosystem need objective. Such advantages increase with the time-varying frequency. For the wet periods, smaller flow releases may be prescribed; for the dry periods, however, greater releases must be specified to secure a lower degree of overall hydrologic alteration. It is also revealed that use of the three-class approach to evaluate the overall hydrologic alteration facilitates to eliminate highly altered IHA and maintain those low-flow characteristics subtle to flow diversions. However, such Outcomes are achieved at the cost of greater deficits for human water demands.

Appl.,A histogram matching approach for assessment of flow regime alteration Application to environmental flow optimization,Shiau J;Wu F,"In this paper we present a Histogram Matching Approach (HMA) for assessment of the flow regime alteration. The HMA uses the degree of histo-rain dissimilarity as a metric for impact assessment, which is based on the quadratic-form distance between the frequency vectors of the pre- and post-impact histograms weighted by a specified similarity matrix. The HMA is coupled with an aggregated multiobjective optimization genetic algorithm and applied to a case study on the Kaoping diversion weir (Taiwan) for determining the optimal environmental flow scheme that balances the ecosystem and human needs objectives. Two key issues are addressed in this study. First. we compare the performances of the HMA and existing Range of Variability Approach (RVA). Second, we employ three types of similarity function to investigate their effect on the Outcomes of the HMA. The results reveal that the HMA consistently outperforms the RVA in preserving the natural flow variability regardless of what type of similarity function is used. No single type of similarity function can be found that would simultaneously best preserve the natural patterns of 32 Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA). For the situations where the water-supply reliability is of critical concerti, the pulse similarity is recommended because it would assure the smallest water-supply deficit. If, however, minor degradation in the water-supply reliability may he overlooked. the linear similarity is suggested because it would generally result in the post-impact flows that most satisfactorily resemble to the natural flow regime.

Appl.,CHANGE DETECTION OF GRAVEL MINING ON RIVERBEDS FROM THE MULTITEMPORAL AND HIGHSPATIALRESOLUTION FORMOSAT2 IMAGERY,Liu C;Shieh C;Wu C;Shieh M,"Gravel mining from river channels is conducted in many countries around the world, yet ground-based monitoring of these activities requires considerable manpower and is not very effective. Therefore, innovative and effective approaches to monitoring gravel mining are urgently required. Deployed as a high spatial resolution sensor in a daily revisit orbit, Formosat-2 has proved to be an ideal satellite for site surveillance. Using one known event of gravel mining in the Tseng-Wen River, Taiwan, between March 2004 and March 2005, we analysed nine Formosat-2 images taken during this period to summarize three characteristics of gravel mining in the images. Based on these characteristics, a standard procedure for processing Formosat-2 imagery to detect gravel mining is proposed. This procedure is validated against ground truthing collected by an unmanned helicopter flying at low altitude. The evolution of this gravel-mining event in the Tseng-Wen River is described by processing all historical Formosat-2 imagery using the proposed procedure. This standard procedure has been successfully incorporated into the Formosat-2 automatic image processing system and has been used to monitor gravel mining on a daily-basis.

2009.0,River Res. Appl.,REGIONALIZATION OF NATURAL FLOW REGIME APPLICATION TO ENVIRONMENTAL FLOW OPTIMIZATION AT UNGAUGED SITES,Shiau J;Wu F,"In this work we use the regionalization approach (RA) to derive the natural flow regime at an ungauged site. The derived natural flow regime, expressed by the regional cdf models of 32 indicators of hydrologic alteration (IHA) is used in the histogram matching approach (HMA) to seek the optimal environmental flows for a proposed multiobjective diversion weir in Taiwan. The results reveal that the outcomes associated with the planning constant scheme are significantly improved by the optimal time-varying scheme. The histogram dissimilarities of 32 IHA associated with the planning scheme are consistently greater than those associated with the optimal scheme, especially for low-flow IHA. Despite the inherent discrepancy between different approaches to generating flow data at the ungauged site, the optimal outcomes resulting from the RA-baged natural flow regime appear to be plausible and consistent with those reported in the previous work, thus validating the RA used in this work. We also explore the effect of weighting factors on the optimal outcomes. The results reveal that the weighting factor of the ecosystem needs objective dominates all optimal outcomes, while those of the agricultural demands and interbasin transfers objectives have minor effects on the optimal outcomes. The global optimal solution is obtained with a full or null weighting assigned to the ecosystem needs objective, while the least optimal solution is obtained as the interbasin transfers objective is given a null weighting and the agricultural demands objective is weighted more than the ecosystem needs objective. River managers and decision makers may select more balanced weir operation strategies based on the results presented in this work.

2016.0,River Res. Appl.,Geomorphic Responses to a Large CheckDam Removal on a Mountain River in Taiwan,Wang H;Kuo W,"The ability to understand and predict the impacts of dam removal in river systems is important, especially as dam decommissioning is becoming increasingly popular. In this study, we document the morphological and sediment impact of the removal of Chijiawan Check Dam in May 2011; a 13-m-high dam located on a coarse-grained, steep mountain river channel in Taiwan. An estimated 0.2millionm(3) of sediment had accumulated within the impoundment before its removal. Longitudinal and bankfull cross-sectional surveys and a detailed sediment textural survey were undertaken along a 3.2-km study reach of the Chijiawan Creek between 2010 and 2012. A rotating knickpoint with migration rates of up to 22m/day was observed along the study reach, following dam removal. The rate and character of channel change, associated with the dam removal, appear to be driven as much by channel morphology and distance from the dam as by the hydrology variability. Our results suggested that relatively small amounts of sediment were eroded during the first 3weeks following dam removal because of low discharge conditions. However, after 1 and 15months, 10 and 75% of the sediment that had accumulated within former impounded was eroded, respectively. Sites near the former dam had a sediment texture that reflected the transport of released sediment, and this suggested that basin-wide sediment processes exerted a strong influence. The removal of Chijiawan Dam offers unique insight on how sediment processes can drive river channel responses to sediment pulses may vary with discharge and sediment load, in areas subject to remarkably high flows and sediment loads.

2017.0,River Res. Appl.,Estimating discharge in gravelbed river using noncontact groundpenetrating and surfacevelocity radars,Hong J;Guo W;Wang H;Yeh P,"Discharge measurement is a critical task for gravel-bed channels. Under high-flow conditions, the elevation of the riverbed changes significantly by intensive torrential flow. The stage-discharge relations commonly used for stream discharge estimation may no longer be adequate. The contact-type velocity measuring is also subject to measurement errors and/or instrument failures by the high-flow velocities, driftwood, stumps, and debris. This study developed a new real-time method to estimate river discharge in gravel-bed channels. A systematic measuring technology combining ground-penetrating radar and surface-velocity radar was employed. The rating curves representing the relations of water surface velocity to the channel cross-sectional mean velocity and flow area were established. Stream discharge was then deduced from the resulting mean velocity and flow area. The proposed method was examined in a steep gravel-bed reach of the Cho-Shui River in central Taiwan. The estimated stream discharge during three flood events were compared to the prediction by using the stage-discharge relation and the index-velocity method. The proposed method of this study is capable of computing reasonable values of discharge for an entire flood hydrograph, whereas the other two methods tend to produce large extrapolation errors. Moreover, when the computed discharge is used in 2D flood flow simulation, the proposed method demonstrates better performance than the commonly used stage-discharge and index-velocity methods.","Natl Appl Res Labs, Taiwan Typhoon & Flood Res Inst, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Marine Environm & Engn, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,4,1.0,,"Yeh, PH (corresponding author), Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Marine Environm & Engn, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and Technology, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 105-2625-M-492-014]","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, Grant/Award Number: MOST 105-2625-M-492-014",gravel-bed river; ground-penetrating radar; non-contact measurement; river discharge; surface-velocity radar,10.1002/rra.3168,Article,FLOOD DISCHARGE; SCHEME,WILEY,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,4,33,ISI,TAIWAN TYPHOON AND FLOOD RES INST;NATL SUN YAT SEN UNIV,NATL SUN YAT SEN UNIV,A
2020.0,River Res. Appl.,Usingtwodimensionalmodeling to evaluate strategies of sediment reduction and evacuation for Nanshi river under Guishan dam operations,Su H;You G;Chu C,"This paper presents a unique case study of Nanshi River in Taiwan which may be able to serve as the basis for decision making and river maintenance operations or as a reference for other cases. This study area is composed of regions from upstream alluvial channel to delta-front and the Guishan Dam reservoir, with a surplus of material supply to transport capacity in the whole region. Dredging is a standard method by which to deal with the accumulation of sediment within a watercourse; however, our understanding of hydrodynamics and sedimentation is limited by the complexity of the sedimentation process. In addition, most of the similar geomorphological studies did not pay attention to the upstream effects of reservoirs on alluvial channels. Similar examples are more often observed in estuaries and coastal zones. Our objective was to evaluate the morphological impact of river dredging implemented in conjunction with downstream gate operations by employing a 2D hydraulic sediment model, SRH-2D. With the assistance of the model simulations, we revealed that the deposition in the study area is under the interaction among three main mechanisms: headward deposition of the dam, channel width contraction in midstream, and progressive deposition of sediment from the confluence. Accordingly, this study suggested that dredging focuses on the creation of deep trenches in the midstream and upstream sections. It is also important to coordinate gate operations at Guishan Dam with peak flows in order to facilitate the transport of sediment to the reservoir for subsequent discharge via empty flushing. Regarding the effect of Guishan Dam removal, it would have a more pronounced effect on head cutting which leading to erosion in the reservoir and the downstream transport of substantial quantities of sediment, but its effect would be limited to a certain distance. However, dam removal is not considered a viable option considering the need for local water storage and the benefits of the dam in terms of tourism.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,,"You, GJY (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and Technology, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST-107-2625-M002-005]; 10th River Management Office, WRAb results The 10th River Management Office, WRA [MOEAWRA1070242]","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, Grant/Award Number: MOST-107-2625-M002-005; The 10th River Management Office, WRAb results The 10th River Management Office, WRA, Grant/Award Number: MOEAWRA1070242",dredge strategy; flood capacity; river maintenance; sedimentation; SRH-2D,10.1002/rra.3735,Article,MORPHODYNAMIC EVOLUTION; SUSPENDED SEDIMENT; TRANSPORT; SAND; MODELS; RISK; FLOW; MAINTENANCE; CHANNELS; CLIMATE,WILEY,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,0,36,ISI,NATL TAIWAN UNIV,NATL TAIWAN UNIV,A

2001.0,Sci. China Ser. D-Earth Sci.,Physiographic and geological characteristics of shelves in north and west of Taiwan,Yu H;Chou Y,"In north of Taiwan the East China Sea Shelf extends from the coastline of mainland China to the southern Okinawa Trough, showing a shelf-slope-basin bathymetric profile. Sea floor of the East China Sea Shelf is generally smooth and flat. It is wide (230 km) and relatively shallow with an average shelf-break depth of 120 m, reflecting the effect of Quaternary glaciation about 15000 years ago. The Pliocene-Quaternary East China Sea Shelf is underlain by thin sequences of about 1000 m thick shallow marine sediments mainly derived from China, forming an eastward dipping sedimentary wedge due to regional tilting and subsidence and representing the youngest part of the Cenozoic rift margin in southeastern China. The Taiwan Strait Shelf has two phases in development: one is the early phase of the Paleocene-Miocene rift margin and the other is the late stage of the Pliocene-Quaternary foreland sedimentation. It is a foreland shelf and its present morphology results from the combined effects of tectonic subsidence and sedimentation overprinting that of the Late Pleistocene glaciation about 15000 years ago. Southeast of the Taiwan Strait Shelf lies the very narrow Kaoping Shelf along the southwestern Taiwan coast. The island shelf is a short, narrow and shallow shelf (100 km long, 20 km wide and 80 m deep). Progradation of Quaternary orogenic sediments from the Taiwan orogen forms the present island shelf off southwest Taiwan. The shelf represents the early stage of foreland basin sedimentation. The transition from a passive margin shelf (East China Sea Shelf), a foreland shelf (Taiwan Strait Shelf) to an island shelf (Kaoping Shelf) along the strike of the fold-and-thrust belt of Taiwan mainly reflects the oblique collision between the Luzon Arc and the Chinese margin from Pliocene to the present. The accompanying uplift of Taiwan orogen, foreland-basin sedimentation, and sea level changes contribute to the formation of these three different shelves adjacent to Taiwan.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, Taipei 106, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,0.0,"Yu, HS (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, Taipei 106, Taiwan.",,,Taiwan; shelf; foreland basin; glaciation,10.1007/BF02907199,Article,BASINS,SCIENCE PRESS,SCIENCE IN CHINA SERIES D-EARTH SCIENCES,16,44,ISI,NATL TAIWAN UNIV,NATL TAIWAN UNIV,B2

The results show, when comparing them with native sulfur from crater lakes and other volcanic areas, that the native sulfur content of this chimney is very high (99.96%), the rare earth element (REE) and trace element constituents of the chimney are very low (Sigma REE < 21x10(-9)), and the chondrite-normalized REE patterns of the native sulfur samples are similar to those of the Kueishantao andesite, implying that the interaction of subseafloor fluid-andesite at the Kueishantao hydrothermal field was of short duration. The sulfur isotopic compositions of the native sulfur samples reveal that the sulfur of the chimney, from H2S and SO2, originated by magmatic degassing and that the REEs and trace elements are mostly from the Kueishantao andesite and partly from seawater. Combining these results with an analysis of the thermodynamics, it is clear that from the relatively low temperature (< 116 degrees C), the oxygenated and acidic environment is favorable for formation of this native sulfur chimney in the Kueishantao hydrothermal field.","Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Seafloor Hydrothermal Act Lab, Key Lab Marine Geol & Environm, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China.; Chinese Acad Sci, Grad Univ, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.; Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Inst Marine Geol & Chem, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.;",CHINA;CHINA;TAIWAN,CHINA,CHINA,8,3.0,0.0,"Zeng, ZG (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Seafloor Hydrothermal Act Lab, Key Lab Marine Geol & Environm, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China.",,,origin; native sulfur chimney; Kueishantao hydrothermal field; northeast Taiwan,10.1007/s11430-007-0092-y,Article,BACK-ARC BASIN; ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION; VOLCANIC-ROCKS; GEOCHEMISTRY; SYSTEM; MAGMATISM; CHEMISTRY; SEDIMENTS; SEAWATER; ISLANDS,SCIENCE PRESS,SCIENCE IN CHINA SERIES D-EARTH SCIENCES,24,50,ISI,INST OCEANOL;GRAD UNIV;NATL SUN YAT SEN UNIV,INST OCEANOL,B2
2010.0,Sci. China-Earth Sci.,A multisubwaveform parametric retracker of the radar satellite altimetric waveform and recovery of gravity anomalies over coastal oceans,Guo J;Gao Y;Hwang C;Sun J,"The quality of satellite radar altimetric data is very important in studies of geodesy, geophysics, and oceanography. Over coastal oceans, altimeter waveforms are contaminated by the terrain and physical environments so that the accuracy of altimeter data is lower than that over open oceans. Here we develop a new multi-subwaveform parametric retracker (MSPR) to improve the quality of altimeter data for the recovery of gravity anomaly in coastal oceans. The least squares collocation method is used to recover the residual gravity anomaly over the coastal water from altimetric data. The waveform data records from Geosat/GM around Taiwan Island are practically retracked with MSPR. When compared with the Taiwan geoid height, the results retracked by MSPR are more accurate than those retracked by the well-known beta-5-parmeter method and from the geophysical data records (GDRs). The gravity anomalies over Taiwan coastal waters are calculated from the retracked altimeter data with the least squares collocation. When we compared gravity anomalies computed using altimeter GDRs with the ship-borne gravity data over Taiwan coastal ocean, we found that the results from retracked data are more accurate than those from GDRs.","Shandong Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Geodesy & Geomat, Qingdao 266510, Peoples R China.;  State Bur Surveying & Mapping, Key Lab Surveying & Mapping Isl & Reef, Qingdao 266510, Peoples R China.;  Chinese Acad Sci, Natl Astron Observ, Beijing 100012, Peoples R China.;  Fuzhou Univ, Coll Environm & Resources, Fuzhou 350108, Peoples R China.;  Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan.;",CHINA;CHINA;CHINA;CHINA;TAIWAN,CHINA,CHINA,4,5.0,,"Guo, JY (corresponding author), Shandong Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Geodesy & Geomat, Qingdao 266510, Peoples R China.","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [40774009]; National Hi-tech R & D Program of ChinaNational High Technology Research and Development Program of China [2006AA12Z303]; International S & T Cooperation Program of China [2009DFB00130]; Special Fund of Taishan Scholars Project of Shandong Province, China [TSXZ0502]; Key Laboratory of Mapping from Space of SBSM, China [200801]","We are very grateful to the anonymous reviewers for their helpful suggestions and to J Lillibridge for supplying the Geosat/GM waveforms.

2011.0,Sci. China-Earth Sci.,Sedimentary erosive processes and sediment dispersal in Kaoping submarine canyon,Chiang C;Yu H,"The Kaoping submarine canyon, connected to the Kaoping River in the coastal plain in SW Taiwan, continues the dispersal path of modern Kaoping River sediments, from an active small mountainous drain basin to the receiving basin of the South China Sea. Using seismic reflection sections, Chirp sonar profiles, and bathymetric mapping, we reveal characteristic erosive processes responsible for multiple cut-and-fill features, deeply entrenched thalweg, and sediment dispersal that are closely related to turbidity currents in the canyon. The river-canyon connection setting, along with extreme climatic conditions and active tectonism, is favorable for generation of turbidity currents at the canyon head. The upper reach of the Kaoping Canyon is distinguished into three distinct morpho/sedimentary features. The canyon head is characterized by V-shaped axial thalweg erosion. The sinuous segment of the upper reach is dominated by a deeply incised canyon pathway with trough-like morphology. Relatively small-scaled features of cut-and-fill associated with the dominant incision process are commonly along the canyon floor, resulting in a flat-floored pathway. Sliding and slumping dominated the steep canyon walls, producing and transporting sediments to canyon floor and partially filling up canyon thalweg. The meandering segment is characterized by erosive features where deeply down-cutting occurs in the outer bend of the major sea valley, forming V-shaped entrenched thalweg. The recurrences of turbidity currents have allowed continuous incision of the canyon head and have kept the connection between the canyon head and the river mouth during Holocene highstand of sea level. The upper reach of the Kaoping Canyon is linked to drainage area and maintains as a conduit and/or sink for terrigenous and shallow marine material. Sediment-laden river plume operates in the Kaoping River-Canyon system, with turbidity currents flushing river sediments into the canyon head where the canyon thalweg is the most erosive. Presently, the upper reach of the Kaoping Canyon can be considered as a temporal sediment sink.","Hsiuping Inst Technol, Taichung, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, Taipei 10764, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,,"Chiang, CS (corresponding author), Hsiuping Inst Technol, Taichung, Taiwan.","""National"" Science Council, Chinese Taiwan","We thank crew and technicians onboard R/V Ocean Researcher I for collecting the marine data for this study.

1999.0,Sci. Rep. Tohoku Univ. Ser. Geogr.,Climate events from the Glacial to the Postglacial and earthsurface responses in Taiwan,Liew P;Tseng M,"The climatic and hydrological events from the Glacial to the Postglacial can be visualized by the vegetational history as well as the characteristics of basin sediments. According to the pollen record of a peat bog located at an altitude of 650 m in central Taiwan (Liew et al., 1998), the following events are recognized. 1. The LGM drought condition is represented by a Gramineae-dominant assemblage (a forest steppe). 2. It then changed firstly at about 15 ka (cal 18 ka) to Cyperaceae-dominant open forest. 3. Forest elements (Cyclobalanopsis. Ilex and Symplocos) clearly increased and became higher than herbs at about 13.9 ka (cal 16-17 ka). 4. A dramatically wet condition occurred at about 12.5 ka (cal 14.5 ka) as indicated by episodic increase in ferns (>50%). 5. Cold-humid conditions represented by increase in Salix occured at about 10.5 ka (cal 12.5 ka) and ended at about 10.1 ka (cal 11.5 ka) with a return to dry conditions. 6. The warm-wet Holocene conditions are indicated by the dramatic increase of warm forest elements like Castanopsis and the dominance of ferns. The intervals of wet conditions represented by extremely high value of ferns at about 9.7 ka-7.3 ka, 6.2-5.6 ka and 2.5-1.5 ka are considered to be due to high precipitation. The frequency of ferns is highest in the early Holocene and then decreases upward. Size analysis of recent 20 ka sediments from the core of the Taipei Basin shows that the LGM is characterized by relatively fine-grained sediments. In contrast to the fine grain sediments during the Glacial period, the conspicuous humidity between 9 and 10 ka is witnessed by the largest grain size sediments (coarse sand) of the same core. High pollen influx under the high sedimentation rate of early Holocene is also found there, and this has been interpreted as resulting from frequent flood events occuring then. On the coastal plain of central western Taiwan, an organic-rich layer was found in the interval between 8.5 and 9.5 ka. This is probably due to that the rising sea level and the rising groundwater table provided more reduced sedimentary environments.","Department of Geology, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,0.0,"Liew, P.-M.; Department of Geology, , Taipei, Taiwan",,NA NA,Alluvial deposit;  Earth surface processes;  Holocene;  Last glacial;  Paleoclimate,hdl.handle.net/10097/45241,Article,fine grained sediment;  fluvial deposit;  Holocene;  paleoclimate; Taiwan,,"Science Reports of the Tohoku University, Series 7: Geography",2,49,scopus,NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY,NOTREPORTED,B2
2013.0,Sediment. Geol.,Early postrift sequence stratigraphy of a MidTertiary rift basin in Taiwan Insights into a siliciclastic fillup wedge,Yu N;Teng L;Chen W;Yue L;Chen M,"In order to scrutinize the development, process and control of an early post-rift siliciclastic fill-up wedge, sequence stratigraphy was applied to the Oligo-Miocene coastal-shelf strata of a mid-Tertiary rift basin in Taiwan. Four sequences at the million-year/3rd-order scale, constrained by microfossil biohorizons and radioactive dates, were identified and correlated regionally. The lower sequence belongs to the fault-bounded Oligocene syn-rift wedge. The middle two comprise the lower Miocene early post-rift wedge, onlapping onto the Mesozoic basement highs. The upper sequence is the lower Miocene late post-rift drape on the continental margin. The middle two sequences record a process of active topographic transformation through successive coastal-shelf progradations. At first, the remnant rift topographic low received drastic progradations from both the inner and outer highs. During the later progradations principally from the inner high, the topographic low was filled up for the successive drape. This wedge formation was characteristically short-lived and high in sedimentation rate, when accommodation space and sediment supply both increased. The initial accommodation space of the remnant rift deep shelf was augmented by rapid thermal subsidence and long-term eustatic sea level rise. The sediment supply, in spite of a decrease in provenance exposure due to onlapping, was promoted by periodic exposures due to 3rd-order eustatic sea level falls, and additionally by a warm and humid climate. These falls are age concordant with the sequence boundaries and thus evidently important for the sequence boundary formations and sediment dispersal. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

2020.0,Sediment. Geol.,Tropical cyclone deposits in the Pliocene Taiwan Strait Processes examples and conceptual model,Dashtgard S;Lowemark L;Vaucher R;Pan Y;Pilarczyk J;Castelltort S,"The characteristics of tropical cyclone (TC) deposits are highly variable, and in the shallow waters of straits their character has not been established. Multiple coarse-grained beds in lower Pliocene strata in the Western Foreland Basin of Taiwan are interpreted as IC deposits, and the sedimentology of these beds reflects evolving TC processes and storm stages. By comparing sedimentological data from these beds with previous research on TCs, and with analysis of TCs that (Toss Taiwan from east to west, a conceptual model is built for understanding deposition in the Taiwan Strait during tropical cyclones. Taiwan is impacted by more than three TCs per year, including more than two super-typhoons every 10 years. These storms can deliver immense volumes of rain over very short time periods and are associated with intense winds. During TCs, and in shallow water in the Taiwan Strait (10-35 m water depth), hyperpycnal discharge, strong bottom currents, and oscillatory wave motion all impact deposition. These processes are manifested in the resulting deposits, and we propose that the best sedimentological criteria for recognizing TC deposits, include: 1) a basal scour surface; 2) an absence of within-bed bioturbation; 3) trough cross-stratification that preserves multi-directional, mainly shore-parallel flow with a 180 degrees change in flow direction; 4) preservation of oscillatory structures towards the top of the bed; and, 5) organic lamina and lasts throughout the bed. Mudstone intercalated with trough cross-stratification is also a useful indicator of TC deposition as it probably reflects wave-and current-redistribution of sediment delivered to the strait through hyperpycnal and hypopycnal discharge from rivers. Contemporaneous mud deposition within TC beds is manifested as mudstone drapes on foresets and toesets, and discontinuous mudstone beds between trough cross-stratified sandstone beds. While not all TC beds exhibit all sedimentological characteristics, we hypothesize that high-probability TC beds should show three or more of them. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

This paper presents new results of detailed geologic mapping, lithofacies analysis, magneto-biostratigraphy, paleocurrent, and paleoslope analyses in the southern Coastal Range to investigate the origins and significance of this mélange. The results show that the Lichi Mélange consists of mass-transport deposits including well-stratified block-in-matrix beds (olistostromes), extra-formational blocks (olistoliths), and broken formation with abundant soft-sediment deformation features that transition laterally into distal mega-slump beds and pebbly mudstones (subaqueous debrites). Abundant observations of depositional contacts and interbedding of mélange with contemporary (ca. 4–1 Ma) flysch units of the Fanshuliao and Paliwan formations confirm their sedimentary origin. Compacted sedimentological shear fabrics in olistostromal facies are broadly parallel to internal stratification and bedding, and are readily distinguishable from cross-cutting brittle fault zones related to post ~1 Ma west-vergent thrust faults. Paleoslope and paleocurrent analyses record down-slope gravity-driven transport toward the east and southeast. The data provide evidence for a polygenetic origin of the Lichi Mélange, in which sedimentary mass-wasting deposits are overprinted by younger tectonic shear zones. Slide blocks, conglomerate clasts, and detrital sand were all derived from an eroding source in the east-vergent eastern retrowedge of the Taiwan collisional orogen. The source area included tectonically accreted fragments of the two converging plates that represent shallow-crustal equivalents of the Miocene Yuli Belt and Eastern Slates exposed in the modern Central Range. Reconstructed stratigraphic panels record eastward progradation of olistostromal facies over distal basinal flysch deposits, which we infer resulted from eastward (oceanward) migration of a steep submarine slope at the leading edge of the retrowedge orogenic front. Thus, the Coastal Range basin evolved as a migrating retro-foredeep basin that formed on top of older, pre-collisional volcanic arc and forearc crust. These results demonstrate a unique type of sedimentary basin that is formed and then rapidly inverted at a convergent continent-ocean interface during the transition from intra-oceanic subduction to arc-continent collision.

1998.0,Sedimentology,The coastal transition at the mouth of a small mountainous river in Taiwan,Liu J;Yuan P;Hung J,"The Tseng-wen River is a small mountainous river in southern Taiwan that has distinct dry and flood seasons. Several lines of evidence have revealed that the depositional system at the mouth of the river has transformed from a deltaic system to an estuarine system. The evidence includes long to short-term shoreline changes, geomorphology of the river mouth, mixed sediment sources inside the river mouth, mixing and suspended sediment characteristics inside the river mouth, and the grain-size distribution patterns on the river bed. Unlike the long-term evolution of many other coastal systems, the transformation at the Tseng-wen River mouth is largely caused by the building of a reservoir in the middle reaches of the river.

2014.0,Shock Vib,A numerical study of the screening effectiveness of open trenches for highspeed traininduced vibration,Chiang C;Tsai P,"This study used the 2D boundary element method in time domain to examine the screening effectiveness of open trenches on reducing vibration generated by a high-speed train. The parameters included configurations of the trench, train speed, the distance between the source and the trench, and the Poisson's ratio of the soil. A reducing displacement level (in dB scale) was defined and used to evaluate the screening effectiveness of a wave barrier. The maximal reducing displacement level reached 25 dB when an open trench was used as a wave barrier. The depth of an open trench is a main influential parameter of screening effectiveness. The cutoff frequency of the displacement spectrum increases with decreasing trench depth. The maximal screening effectiveness occurs when the depth is 0.3-0.4 Rayleigh wavelength. Using an open trench as a wave barrier can reduce 10-25 dB of vibration amplitude at frequencies between 30 and 70 Hz. A considerable increase in screening effectiveness of the open trench was observed from 30 to 70 Hz, which matches the main frequencies of vibration induced by Taiwan High Speed Rail. The influence of trench width on screening effectiveness is nonsignificant except for frequencies from 30 to 40 Hz. Poisson's ratio has various effects on the reduction of vibration at frequencies higher than 30 Hz. Copyright © 2014 C.-h. Chiang and P.-h.

2021.0,Shock Vib,Introduction and Application of a Simple Probabilistic Liquefaction Hazard Analysis Program HAZ45PL Module,Chou J;Hsieh P;Lin P;Yen Y;Lin Y,"The 2016 Meinong Earthquake hit southern Taiwan and many shallow foundation structures were damaged due to soil liquefaction. In response, the government initiated an investigation project to construct liquefaction potential maps for metropolitans in Taiwan. These maps were used for the preliminary safety assessment of infrastructures or buildings. However, the constructed liquefaction potential map used the pseudo-probabilistic approach, which has inconsistent return period. To solve the inconsistency, the probabilistic liquefaction hazard analysis (PLHA) was introduced. However, due to its complicated calculation procedure, PLHA is not easy and convenient for engineers to use without a specialized program, such as in Taiwan. Therefore, PLHA is not a popular liquefaction evaluation procedure in practice. This study presents a simple PLHA program, HAZ45PL Module, customized for Taiwan. Sites in Tainan City and Yuanlin City are evaluated using the HAZ45PL Module to obtain the hazard curve and to construct the liquefaction probability map. The liquefaction probability map provides probabilities of different liquefaction potential levels for engineers or owners to assess the performance of an infrastructure or to design a mitigation plan. © 2021 Jui-Ching Chou et al.","Department of Civil Engineering, National Chung-Hsing University, Taichung, 40227, Taiwan; Sinotech Engineering Consultants, Inc., Taipei, 11494, Taiwan; Liming Engineering Consultants Co.

It particularly argues that Lanyu's native Tao people have begun to gain a somewhat stronger cultural identity and autonomy through this landscape. Orchid Island underwent rapid modernization within the past 60 years. The article not only shows how tourism was imposed by Taiwan's government, but also how the Tao have made greater use of tourism's landscape over time for their own purposes. Not without sociocultural problems and contradictions, Lanyu's tourism landscape has been polysemic enough to allow for gradually improving relationships between Taiwanese and Tao and for gradually increasing Tao participation in modernity on their own terms. © 2013 The Authors Singapore Journal of Tropical Geography © 2013 Department of Geography, National University of Singapore and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.","Department of Geography, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea; Eastern Taiwan Studies Association, Taitung, Taiwan",KOREA;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,KOREA,KOREA,2,2.0,,"Yorgason, E.; Department of Geography, , Daegu, South Korea; 電子郵件: ethanyorgason@gmail.com",,NA NA NA,Hybridity;  Landscape;  Lanyu;  Orchid Island;  Taiwan;  Tourism,10.1111/sjtg.12023,Article,autonomy;  cultural identity;  modernity;  modernization;  tourism; Lanyu;  Taiwan,,Singapore Journal of Tropical Geography,1,34,scopus,KYUNGPOOK NATIONAL UNIVERSITY;EASTERN TAIWAN STUDIES ASSOCIATION,NOTREPORTED,A

Geogr.,Taming the groundwater in rural Asia The biopolitics of constructing groundwaterscape,Wang K;Ho C;Chen C,"In this paper, we leverage on a case study about the governance of groundwater and the hazard of land subsidence in Yunlin, Taiwan, to address the state's political strategies of producing ‘hydro-social territories’. Our goal is to examine how local agents and their knowledge of the socio-technological system shape groundwater use, with particular attention on how that system has changed due to the governmentalized regulation of groundwater resources as a means to mitigate land subsidence. Drawing from the local agrarian development and its tube well irrigation networks that underlie the groundwater-scape in this research, the paper demonstrates that the ‘hydro-social territory’ itself is complicated, as local farmers who rely on groundwater are never fully controlled by the state, regardless of whether or not they use groundwater for agricultural cultivation or other purposes, yet at the same time, the intention of governmentalizing the local groundwater regime is concealed and has become more concrete with the introduction of new sciences and technologies. © 2021 Department of Geography, National University of Singapore and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","Research Centre for Humanities and Social Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan; Institute of History and Philology, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Geography, Chinese Culture University, Taipei, Taiwan",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,,"Ho, C.-Y.; Institute of History and Philology, Taiwan; 電子郵件: d99544006@ntu.edu.tw",,NA NA NA NA,Asia;  groundwater governance;  hydro-social territory;  land subsidence;  rural development,10.1111/sjtg.12358,Article,agricultural worker;  groundwater resource;  politics;  rural development;  territorial management;  water management; Taiwan;  Yunlin,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,Singapore Journal of Tropical Geography,0,42,scopus,ACADEMIA SINICA;INSTITUTE OF HISTORY AND PHILOLOGY;CHINESE CULTURE UNIVERSITY,INSTITUTE OF HISTORY AND PHILOLOGY,A

These studies have not lead to a concensus as to how fines can affect the behavior of sand. Earlier studies have mostly been limited to tests on reconstituted specimens. Some of the controversies stem from the concerns that reconstituted specimens may not be able to duplicate the soil fabric in the field. The authors used Laval sampler to retrieve high quality samples with a wide range of fines contents in Central Western Taiwan. A test site was developed in Yuan Lin Township where standard penetration test (SPT), seismic piezocone (SCPTU) and field shear wave velocity (V-s) measurements were performed in addition to Laval sampling. A series of monotonic and cyclic triaxial tests with V-s measurements were conducted on natural and reconstituted Yuan Lin Soil (YLS) specimens with fines contents ranging from 18 to 89%. While the study confirmed some of the earlier findings which indicated that fines tend to weaken the soil specimens, the results also showed that the effects of fines may be exaggerated according to tests on reconstituted specimens.","Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Hsinchu, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,1.0,"Huang, AB (corresponding author), Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Hsinchu, Taiwan.",,,alluvial deposit; dilatancy; laboratory test; sampling; sand; shear strength,10.3208/sandf.47.771,Article,LIQUEFACTION RESISTANCE; CLEAN SANDS; SILTY SAND; STRENGTH; BEHAVIOR; SOILS,JAPANESE GEOTECHNICAL SOC,SOILS AND FOUNDATIONS,10,47,ISI,NATL CHIAO TUNG UNIV,NATL CHIAO TUNG UNIV,B2
2009.0,Soils Found.,EFFECTS OF HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL SEISMIC LOADS ON THE BEARING CAPACITY OF A SURFACE FOOTING ADJACENT TO A SLOPE,Huang C,"The correction factor (eta(ie)) for the ultimate bearing capacity of a footing placed adjacent to a slope, taking into account the combined effect of horizontal and vertical seismic loads, represented by horizontal and vertical seismic coefficients, k(h), and k(v), respectively, was derived using a modified Janbu's slice method. The influence of slope angles 'alpha' on the values of 'eta(ie)' are studied here. It was found that the values of eta(ie) can be expressed as an exponential function of 'k(h)/(1 - k(v))' and 'alpha', with a measurable interdependency between 'alpha' and 'eta(ie)'. The influence of 'alpha' on the value of 'eta(ie)' increases as the input value of 'k(h)/(1 - k(v))' increases. Equations derived based on the analytical results are proposed to account for this effect. Based on the analyses of 11 near-fault seismographers obtained in the 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake in Taiwan, a ratio between the vertical and the horizontal seismic coefficients, lambda, of between +/- 0.25 is suggested for including the combined effect of vertical and horizontal seismic forces in evaluating the seismic bearing capacity of footings located in near-fault areas.","Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,1,1.0,,"Huang, CC (corresponding author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.",,,bearing capacity; earthquake resistant; inclined load; shallow foundation; slope,10.3208/sandf.49.249,Article,DISPLACEMENTS,JAPANESE GEOTECHNICAL SOC,SOILS AND FOUNDATIONS,3,49,ISI,NATL CHENG KUNG UNIV,NATL CHENG KUNG UNIV,A
2009.0,Soils Found.,FIELD EVALUATION OF THE CYCLIC STRENGTH VERSUS CONE TIP RESISTANCE CORRELATION IN SILTY SANDS,Huang A;Tai Y;Lee W;Huang Y,"The liquefaction potential assessment under the framework of simplified procedure that involves the use of cone penetration tests (CPT) typically relies on empirical correlations between the soil cyclic resistance ratio, CRR and cone tip resistance q(t). For sands that contain fines (particles passing #200 sieve), an adjustment based on fines content in the CRR-q(t) correlation is called for in currently available procedures. Earlier laboratory calibration tests in reconstituted silty sand specimens performed by the authors have indicated that partial drainage in CPT played an important role in the CRR-q(t) correlations. A series of laboratory tests on undisturbed samples and field piezocone penetration tests (CPTU) were carried out in an alluvial soil deposit at two test sites in Central and Southern Taiwan. The results indicated that unlike the uniformly mixed specimens reconstituted in laboratory, the tested natural alluvial silt/sand soils can be heterogeneous with closely spaced clean sand layers embedded in a matrix of silty material. This stratification can render the CPTU a drained test even at fines contents well in excess of 50%. The ignorance of free draining effects on CPTU due to stratification in alluvial soils may lead to overestimation of CRR. Because of these factors, calibration of the CRR-q(t) correlations by performing tests in local soil and field procedures to ascertain the drainage conditions in CPTU are important to the proper application of the CRR-q(t) correlations in the liquefaction potential assessment.","Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Hsinchu, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Taipei, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,4,1.0,1.0,"Huang, AB (corresponding author), Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Hsinchu, Taiwan.","National Science Council of Taiwan, ROCMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [96-2221-E-009005, 95-2221-E-009-202, 94-2211-E-009-043]","The research was funded by the National Science Council of Taiwan, ROC under contracts 96-2221-E-009005, 95-2221-E-009-202 and 94-2211-E-009-043.

2012.0,Soils Found.,Stability monitoring of rainfallinduced deep landslides through pore pressure profile measurements,Huang A;Lee J;Ho Y;Chiu Y;Cheng S,"It has long been recognized that field hydrological and geomechanical properties/conditions are the key elements controlling the stability of a slope under the influence of rainfall. Warning systems based on rainfall or ground displacement measurements are popular methods currently being used to minimize the hazards of landslides. When field hydrological monitoring is used, it usually involves a limited number of sensors for either positive or negative pore-water pressure measurements. The available numerical schemes that couple pore-water pressure with a geomechanical analysis are the most suitable for shallow slope failures. Due to the variable and transient nature of the hydrological conditions in earth slopes, field measurements that reflect the pore-water pressure profile on a realtime basis would be highly desirable. Thus, the authors have developed a piezometer system that is based on optical fiber Bragg grating (FBG) pressure sensors. With this system, an array of nine sensors was installed in a single, 60-m-deep borehole to monitor the pore-water pressure profile in a highway slope in Southern Taiwan. This paper describes the details of the FBG sensor array installation in the field and the data obtained throughout three typhoons from 2008 to 2010. The results demonstrate that the field readings can be readily incorporated into the existing mechanics-based analytical framework and can predict the potential of an upcoming slope failure.

2013.0,Soils Found.,Phase concept for mudflow based on the influence of viscosity,Lee S;Widjaja B,"The phase concept implies that the state of soil changes from plastic to viscous liquid as a function of water content. This principle could be used to interpret the behavior of mudflows, the most dangerous mass movements today. When Typhoon Jangmi hit northern Taiwan in 2008, a mudflow occurred in the Maokong area as a result of the high-intensity rainfall. This case was studied using three simulations, each with a different water content. Based on the mudflow classifications, the primary criteria used in this study were flow velocity and solid concentration by volume, while the major rheology parameters directly obtained from our new laboratory device, the flow box test, were yield stress and viscosity. The results show that the mass movement confirmed the aforementioned criteria for mudflow when the water content reaches or exceeds the liquid limit. The flow box test can determine the viscosity for both plastic and viscous liquid states, which is advantageous. Viscosity is important for explaining the general characteristics of mudflow movement because it controls flow velocity. Therefore, the present study successfully elucidates the changes in mudflow from its initiation to its transportation and deposition via a numerical simulation using laboratory rheology parameters.

The data from lateral load tests on two large-sized reinforced concrete piles were analyzed in this study. The original penetration resistance of the coal ash layer was low, but it increased after the ground improvement. Based on the load-defection curves of the test piles, the complete relationships of equivalent subgrade reaction coefficient kh with lateral displacement were derived and compared with those suggested by the Architectural Institute of Japan (AIJ) and the Japan Road Association (JRA). A composite SPT-N value was adopted to include the contribution of the gravel piles. It was found that the JRA equation using the composite SPT-N value fitted well with the relationships. Moreover, the experimental pile response and p-y curves were deduced using the inclinometer slope data. The relationships of the secant kh of the p-y curves vs. the normalized lateral displacement were further compiled and compared with those predicted by the JRA method. It was shown that the predicted curves using the composite SPT-N values also agreed well with the experimental relationships. Through a comparison of the profiles of the soil reaction with some existing lateral limiting soil pressure formulas, it was found that Prasad and Chari's method was able to yield predictions close to the ultimate soil reaction.

2013.0,Solid Earth,Application of titaniuminquartz thermobarometry to greenschist facies veins and recrystallized quartzites in the Hsuehshan range Taiwan,Kidder S;Avouac J;Chan Y,"The accuracy, reliability and best practises of Ti-in-quartz thermobarometry (TitaniQ) in greenschist facies rocks have not been established. To address these issues, we measured Ti concentrations in rutile-bearing samples of moderately deformed, partially recrystallized quartzite and vein quartz from the Hsuehshan range, Taiwan. The spread of Ti concentrations of recrystallized grains in quartzite correlates with recrystallized grain size. Recrystallized quartz (grain size similar to 100-200 mu m) that formed during early deformation within the biotite stability field shows a marked increase in intermediate Ti-concentration grains (similar to 1-10 ppm) relative to detrital porphyroclasts (Ti similar to 0.1-200 ppm). Fine recrystallized quartz (similar to 5% of the samples by area, grain size similar to 10-20 mu m) has a further restricted Ti concentration peaking at 0.8-2 ppm. This trend suggests equilibration of Ti in recrystallized quartz with a matrix phase during deformation and cooling. Unlike previously documented examples, Ti concentration in the quartzite is inversely correlated with blue cathodoluminescence. Deformation was associated with a minimum grain boundary diffusivity of Ti on the order of 10(-22) m(2) s(-1). Vein emplacement and quartzite recrystallization are independently shown to have occurred at 250-350 degrees C and 300-410 degrees C, respectively, with lithostatic pressure of 3-4 kbar (assuming a geothermal gradient of 25 degrees km(-1)), and with hydrostatic fluid pressure. Estimates of the accuracy of TitaniQ at these conditions depend on whether lithostatic or fluid pressure is used in the TitaniQ calibration. Using lithostatic pressure and these temperatures, the Thomas et al. (2010) calibration yields Ti concentrations within error of concentrations measured by SIMS. If fluid pressure is instead used, predicted temperatures are similar to 30-40 degrees C too low. TitaniQ has potential to yield accurate PT information for vein emplacement and dynamic recrystallization of quartz at temperatures as low as similar to 250 degrees C, however clarification of the relevant pressure term and further tests in rutile-present rocks are warranted.","CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.;  Acad Sinica, Taipei 115, Taiwan.;",USA;TAIWAN,USA,NEW ZEALAND,3,2.0,2.0,"Kidder, S (corresponding author), Univ Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.",Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation via Caltech's Tectonics Observatory,"The manuscript directly benefited from interactions with Michel Bestmann, Jeremy Boyce, John Eiler, Aaron Martin, Mike Palin, Jason Saleeby, Martine Simoes, James Scott, Joann Stock, Marion Le Voyer, and Brian Wernicke.

Fine recrystallized quartz (∼5% of the samples by area, grain size ∼10-20 μm) has a further restricted Ti concentration peaking at 0.8-2 ppm. This trend suggests equilibration of Ti in recrystallized quartz with a matrix phase during deformation and cooling. Unlike previously documented examples, Ti concentration in the quartzite is inversely correlated with blue cathodoluminescence. Deformation was associated with a minimum grain boundary diffusivity of Ti on the order of 10&minus;22m2 s-1. Vein emplacement and quartzite recrystallization are independently shown to have occurred at 250-350 C and 300-410 C, respectively, with lithostatic pressure of 3-4 kbar (assuming a geothermal gradient of 25 km-1), and with hydrostatic fluid pressure. Estimates of the accuracy of TitaniQ at these conditions depend on whether lithostatic or fluid pressure is used in the TitaniQ calibration. Using lithostatic pressure and these temperatures, the Thomas et al. (2010) calibration yields Ti concentrations within error of concentrations measured by SIMS. If fluid pressure is instead used, predicted temperatures are ∼30-40 C too low. TitaniQ has potential to yield accurate PT information for vein emplacement and dynamic recrystallization of quartz at temperatures as low as ∼250 C, however clarification of the relevant pressure term and further tests in rutile-present rocks are warranted. © 2013 Author (s).","California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, United States; Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan; University of Otago, New Zealand",USA;TAIWAN;NEW ZEALAND,USA,USA,3,2.0,,"Kidder, S.; California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, United States; 電子郵件: steven.kidder@otago.ac.nz",,NA NA NA,,10.5194/se-4-1-2013,Article,Fluid pressures;  Geothermal gradients;  Grain boundary diffusivity;  Lithostatic pressure;  Recrystallized grain sizes;  Recrystallized grains;  Thermobarometry;  Ti-in-Quartz thermobarometry; Calibration;  Deformation;  Dynamic recrystallization;  Grain boundaries;  Grain size and shape;  Mica;  Quartz; Metamorphic rocks; accuracy assessment;  cathodoluminescence;  concentration (composition);  emplacement;  experimental mineralogy;  greenschist facies;  P-T conditions;  quartz;  quartz vein;  quartzite;  recrystallization;  reliability analysis;  titanium; Hsueh Shan;  Taiwan,,Solid Earth,35,4,scopus,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY;ACADEMIA SINICA;UNIVERSITY OF OTAGO,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R

GPS data observed at these sites were processed, and the network solutions showed the coordinate accuracy to be of 3 - 4 cm in horizontal components. The coordinate data was also compared with that measured before the earthquake to investigate the displacements. The estimates showed horizontal displacements of 0.1 m to 8.5 mm for the sites observed. It was also found that significant displacements extended along the Chelungpu active fault, where a fault trace ruptured at the earthquake has been clearly seen.","Chung Cheng Inst Technol, Dept Surveying & Mapping Engn, Taichung, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,1,1.0,0.0,"Chang, CC (corresponding author), Chung Cheng Inst Technol, Dept Surveying & Mapping Engn, Taichung, Taiwan.",,,,10.1179/sre.2000.35.278.563,Article,,"COMMONWEALTH ASSOC SURVEYING LAND ECONOMY, C A S L E",SURVEY REVIEW,4,35,ISI,CHUNG CHENG INST TECHNOL,CHUNG CHENG INST TECHNOL,B2

Using results from differential leveling, the magnitudes of land subsidence from 1992 to 7994 were calculated for 50 benchmarks. The calculated maximum magnitude of land subsidence is 15.4 centimeters between these two years. Spatial interpolation is frequently required to provide information for assessing the distribution and extent of subsidence. In this study, geostatistics were applied to describe and characterize the spatial structure of sample data. Thus, an implementation procedure was proposed for the quality assessment of interpolation.

Here, we estimated the coordinates of the GPS stations by using the annual epoch-observed and permanent continuously-recorded GPS data covering the 1992-1999 period Taking into account the effects of secular motion and post-deformation, we calculated the corrected coseismic displacements. Relatively large coseismic displacements of 8-9 in in the horizontal and vertical components were found in the northern part of the fault. Stations on the hanging wall shifted horizonatly 2-9 in in the NW direction and decreased in magnitude from west to east. On the other hand, displacements on the footwall were less than 2 in in the SE direction hid increased from west to east. The size of the zone overlapping the hanging wall and the foowall showed a decrease of 796 ppm in 494 km(2). This is in direct contrast to areas near the fault which increased in size from 13 to 23 7 ppm. Significant postseismic deformations were also observed in data from the existing 44 permanent stations and 7 temporary stations.

2003.0,Surv. Rev.,A new height reference network in Taiwan,Yang M;Chen K;Shiao S,"The island of Taiwan is located in an active tectonic zone on the boundary of the Eurasian and Philippine Sea plates. Due to the continuous mountain building process in association with the collision of the two plates, it is very important for Taiwan to periodically re-survey the island so as to maintain the intrinsic accuracy requirement of its vertical reference network. The existing height network was created in 1979 by means of the spirit levelling technique with theoretical surface gravity quantities derived from the Geodetic Reference System 1967 (GRS67) normal gravity field. Because of the lack of use of actual gravity measurements in its creation, the existing network has been found to suffer from severe systematic errors in the central mountainous areas. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a new national vertical datum in Taiwan, Taiwan Vertical Datum 2001 (TWVD2001). The new datum was developed by optimally combining geodetic levelling and surface gravity observations collected at 1010 newly established benchmarks within a network of 2200-km first-order levelling lines. The data analyses and adjustment computation were based on geopotential numbers. Both orthometric and normal heights were computed for the new vertical reference network.","Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Surveying Engn, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,,"Yang, M (corresponding author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Surveying Engn, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.",,,,10.1179/003962603791482613,Article,,"COMMONWEALTH ASSOC SURVEYING LAND ECONOMY, C A S L E",SURVEY REVIEW,12,37,ISI,NATL CHENG KUNG UNIV,NATL CHENG KUNG UNIV,A

Jade by direct levelling. Mt Jade is the highest peak in northeast Asia. GPS levelling and trigonometricl levelling were also made to validate the result of direct levelling. For GPS levelling a new geoid model is constructed using Taiwan's latest gravity database and elevation model. The accuracy of the geoid model ranges from cm in coastal plains to dm in high mountains. Helmert deflections of the vertical derived from this geoid model improve the accuracy of trigonometric levelling. Gravity data at benchmarks were collected to compute orthometric corrections for the heights from direct levelling. The Poincare-Prey reduction and the modified Mader reduction of mean gravity yield orthometric corrections that differ by up to dm near Mt. Jade. The Helmert orthometric height of Mt. Jade determined in this work is 3951.798 m, with a 72-mm commission error. The problem of using a rigorous orthometric height is discussed.","Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan.; Land Survey Bur, Minist Interior, Taichung 408, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,5,1.0,,"Hwang, C (corresponding author), Natl Chiao Tung Univ, 1001 Ta Hsueh Rd, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan.",,,GPS; pseudolite; obstructed sky; positioning; precision,10.1179/003962607X164961,Article,GRAVITY,"COMMONWEALTH ASSOC SURVEYING LAND ECONOMY, C A S L E",SURVEY REVIEW,2,39,ISI,NATL CHIAO TUNG UNIV,NATL CHIAO TUNG UNIV,A

Rev.,LAND SUBSIDENCE USING ABSOLUTE AND RELATIVE GRAVIMETRY A CASE STUDY IN CENTRAL TAIWAN,Hwang C;Cheng T;Cheng C;Hung W,"We experiment with absolute and relative gravimetry, to determine land subsidence. A gravin, network in the Yunlin County of central Taiwan is established to determine gravity variations that are largely due to land subsidence. Every 6 months, gravity values at two absolute gravity stations were measured by a FG5 gravimeter and those at 7 relative stations by a Graviton-EG and a Scintrex CG-5 relative gravimeter A weighted constraint network adjustment was carried out by holding fixed gravity values at the absolute stations. Correction models for temporal gravity changes are developed and applied to raw gravity measurements. The adjusted gravity values oscillate, but in general increase with time, showing signature of land subsidence. An empirical gravity-to-height admittance factor is determined using gravity change (from FG5) and height change (from levelling) at the two absolute gravity stations. At most gravity stations, there is good agreement between subsidence rates from gravimetry and levelling. Some large discrepancies (> 1 cm/year) also exist and am, caused by uncertainties in relative gravity accuracy, hydrological effects and the admittance factor This study suggests that gravimetry has the potential to determine land subsidence to cm accuracy and is more efficient and economic than tools such as levelling and GPS.","Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Hsinchu, Taiwan.;  Ind Technol Res Inst, Energy & Resource Labs, Hsinchu, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,4,1.0,1.0,"Hwang, C (corresponding author), Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Hsinchu, Taiwan.","National Science CouncilMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [96-2221-E-009-165]; Department of Education, TaiwanMinistry of Education, Taiwan","This study is supported by National Science Council (project number: 96-2221-E-009-165) and Department of Education, Taiwan (project ""Aim for Top University"").",Subsidence; Absolute gravimetry; Relative gravimetry; Central Taiwan,10.1179/003962609X451672,Article,GRAVITY MEASUREMENTS; HEIGHT; GPS,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,SURVEY REVIEW,14,42,ISI,NATL CHIAO TUNG UNIV;IND TECHNOL RES INST,NATL CHIAO TUNG UNIV,B2
2011.0,Surv. Rev.,TIMEVARIANT REFERENCE FRAME TRANSFORMATIONS IN A DEFORMING AREA,Han J;Yu S;van G B,"A time-variant similarity transformation model has been proposed recently for reference frame transformations across time. It has been postulated that reference frame variations only result in uniform deformations (i.e. by the same scale factor in all directions). However, this is not always the case in a deforming area. In this study, a time-variant affine transformation is proposed to accommodate possible non-uniform deformations for reference frame applications in a significantly deforming area. This model also enables the investigation of the deforming behaviour of a reference frame with physically interpretable parameters. To prove its feasibility for present day reference frame applications, numerical tests are performed on an actual data set from the continuous GPS stations in Taiwan. Results illustrate a substantial improvement in the quality of reference frame transformations when the proposed approach is implemented.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Taipei 106, Taiwan.;  Purdue Univ, Sch Civil Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.;",TAIWAN;USA,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,,"Han, JY (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Civil Engn, 1,Sec 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 106, Taiwan.","National Science Council, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [NSC 96-2218-E-002-027]","We thank the two anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments which significantly improved the quality of the original manuscript.

More than 4000 km of levelling lines between solidly constructed benchmarks were repeatedly surveyed by 1st-order levelling. Strict specifications for field work procedures and comprehensive corrections for systemic errors were applied to the levelling data. Furthermore, in order to account for the vertical deformations caused by four major earthquakes during the data span, coseismic offset corrections were computed and applied The adjusted orthometric heights and vertical displacement rates of the benchmarks were obtained by least-squares estimation (LSE). The estimated standard deviations of the vertical rates are in the range of +/- 0.41 mm/yr and +/- 2.47 mm/yr, with a mean value of +/- 1.64 mm/yr. These highly accurate results reveal that the most significant subsidence rate is observed in SW Taiwan at -109.4 mm/yr.

2013.0,Surv. Rev.,A coordinate vector correction method to improve the traditional affine transformation graphic digitised cadastral map,Kao S;Tu C;Chen C,"Parameter coordinate transformation regards the whole transformation region under the same condition for coordinate adjustment. However, the practical errors and ideal corrected values are not 'individually' discussed. The proposed coordinate vector correction method uses 'area' and 'point' to further correct individual coordinates in order to amend the blind spots resulting from overall coordinate transformation. The experimental areas in this study were five graphic area sectors in Taichung City. The graphic digitised TWD67 coordinate system was converted using affine transformation into the TWD97 coordinate system. The coordinate vector correction method was used to correct various boundary point coordinates. The results were compared with affine transformation results and analysed. According to the data obtained from the experimental areas, when the traditional affine transformation was used, the root-mean-square error value of the converted and registered areas could be reduced by 6-69% by using the proposed coordinate vector correction method. The quantity of land parcels exceeding the margin of error (the margin of error adopted in this paper is 0?2!Az0?0003A, where A is the total area of the land parcel in m2 units) decreased by 26-35%. As for the boundary point displacement, the average boundary point offset of the areas was 0?3-4?2 cm. The positions of boundary points could be corrected by small amounts using the proposed coordinate vector correction method, so that the discrepancies between the area formed by boundary points and the registered area could be effectively solved. © 2013 Survey Review Ltd.","National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,,"Tu, C.-P.; National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan; 電子郵件: gsnail1028@yahoo.com.tw",,NA NA NA,Coordinate transformation;  Coordinate vector correction method;  Graphic area;  Land revision,10.1179/1752270612Y.0000000032,Article,cadastre;  coordinate;  mapping;  vector; Taichung;  Taiwan,,Survey Review,2,45,scopus,NATIONAL CHUNG HSING UNIVERSITY,NATIONAL CHUNG HSING UNIVERSITY,A

The main objective of this study is to investigate the validity and uncertainty of the L1 stations in southeastern Taiwan. It is well known that the main error source of single-frequency GPS relative positioning in low latitude areas comes from an atmospheric delay, even if the relative distance is only a few kilometres. In this study, two methods of correction algorithms, including adopting local ionospheric models and applying correction terms from local CORS, are tested to estimate the long-period accuracy of station positioning. Our results indicate that the standard deviation of calibrated relative positioning is in a linear trend with respect to the baseline length. The derived positioning accuracies from applying correction terms from CORS provide satisfactory results with the linear ratios of standard deviation/baseline of 0.11 +/- 0.02, 0.12 +/- 0.02, 0.44 +/- 0.06 mm km(-1) in the north, east and up component, respectively for relative distances under 30 km. The corresponding positioning scatterings amount to 3, 3 and 13 mm, in the north, east and up component, respectively. Although the use of a local ionospheric model algorithm can significantly reduce positioning variation, especially in the north component, the use of the correction terms method yields the best positioning results for three components, horizontal and vertical.","Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei 11529, Taiwan.;  Kun Shan Univ, Dept Real Estate Dev & Management, Tainan 71003, Taiwan.;  Changwon Natl Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Chang Won 641773, Gyeongnam, South Korea.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;KOREA,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,7,1.0,,"Chen, HY (corresponding author), Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, POB 1-55, Taipei 11529, Taiwan.","Taiwan Earthquake Research Center (TEC) - National Science Council [NSC101-2116-M-001-010, NSC102-2116-M-001-016]","The authors would like to express their sincere thanks to their colleagues and assistants who have devoted efforts to the field installation of L1 GPS stations for this study.

The e-GNSS in Taiwan is based on Virtual Reference Station-Real-Time Kinematic technology and networks. The orthometric heights were calculated by subtracting the geoid undulations, derived from three geoid models (gravimetric, hybrid, and geometric models), from the ellipsoidal heights, derived from the e-GNSS. Additionally, two corrector methods, namely the difference and the corrector surface method, were adopted to improve the accuracies and the systematic errors.

In studies of crustal deformation, the relative distance between monitoring stations may vary from several kilometers to tens of kilometers, hence the differential single-frequency observations cannot model the ionospheric delay or other distance dependent errors.

,Surv. Rev.,Adaptive block modeling of time dependent variations of datum reference points in a tectonically active area,Chou C;Han J,"Although a dynamic or semi-dynamic datum has been adopted in some countries, it remains a challenge if a long-term stable datum is to be established in a tectonic active area. This study presents an approach to realistically reflect the time dependent behaviors of ground reference points while maintaining the long-term stability of a datum. An adaptive approach coupled with the Euler motion model is proposed for dividing an area into blocks. A least-squares collocation is then applied for modeling the residual velocities in each block. A case study using the data from 375 continuously operated GNSS stations in Taiwan is presented. It is illustrated that the complex surface kinematics in this region can be divided into three blocks. Significant reductions up to 64% of residual velocities were obtained. This shows that a stable datum can be established in a region with active and complicated surface kinematics by implementing the proposed.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Taipei, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,,"Chou, CY (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Taipei, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and Technology, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [108-2926-I-002-002-MY4]","The authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments that, undoubtedly, helped to enhance the comprehension of our original manuscript.

2017.0,Sustain. Wat. Resour. Manag.,Groundwater origins and recharge in a well field near ChienShih Shinchu Taiwan,Lin P;Tsai L;Wang C;Chang K;Sheng Y;Chu I;Lee W,"Based on global hydrological data, Taiwan has been classified as an area of water shortage. In some regions, and particularly during dry periods, groundwater is the only reliable water resource in Taiwan. This is particularly true for mountain regions. To determine the potential yield, and also to support sustainable management of groundwater resources, groundwater recharge must be estimated. The results of this study showed that there was a close relationship between measurements of the water table and the accumulated monthly precipitation in a well field close to Chien-Shih, Shinchu, NW Taiwan, which suggests that precipitation is the major source of recharge in the study area. However, the difference in the water table between the wet and dry seasons indicated that, in addition to precipitation, there is recharge from another stable source. We determined the pathway from, and the geological setting of, the recharge source areas by comparing precipitation events and temporal transformations in the water types. Out of four potential water types, the water corresponded to the Ca/Mg-SO42- type (III) at different points throughout the study period, indicating geochemical controls, such as dissolution-precipitation, dilution, cation exchange, silicate weathering, and mineralization. Meteoric water stored in the mountain region was another source of recharge that contributed to hydrochemical variability during the dry season. When this source was added, the mean delta O-18 value dropped from -15.8 to 1.4 parts per thousand in precipitation, from -9.6 to -7.8 parts per thousand in river water, from -9.1 to -6.9 parts per thousand in gully 1, from -7.4 to -5.8 parts per thousand in gully 2, and from -9.8 to -6.6 parts per thousand in groundwater. The isotopic compositions of Well C and Well W1 became lighter with additional recharge from the river, while those of Well E, Well W, and Well W2 became heavier during the rainy season. In the dry season, the isotopic composition was lighter in Well W1 and heavier in the other wells. It is worth noting that the isotopic composition of Well W1 was similar to that of the river, suggesting high connectivity between the river and Well W1, possibly through fractures.","Natl Cent Univ, Inst Appl Geol, Zhongli 32001, Taoyuan County, Taiwan.;  Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei 11529, Taiwan.;  Sinotech Engn Consultants Inc, Geotech Engn Res Ctr, Taipei 110, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,7,1.0,,"Tsai, LLY (corresponding author), Natl Cent Univ, Inst Appl Geol, Zhongli 32001, Taoyuan County, Taiwan.",,,Oxygen isotope; Recharge; Groundwater level; Pumping sampling; Fracture; Conceptual model,10.1007/s40899-017-0119-2,Article,,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,1,3,ISI,NATL CENT UNIV;INST EARTH SCI;GEOTECH ENGN RES CTR,NATL CENT UNIV,A
2017.0,Tecnol. Cienc. Agua,Relationships between floods and social fragmentation A case study of Chiayi Taiwan,Lee Y;Peng L;Lee T,"The social vulnerability approach has been recognized as one of the most important tools for exploring contexts and coping strategies in relation to contemporary disasters. However, social vulnerability is such a multi-faceted and complex construct that scholars from different fields have not reached consensus on how best to measure it, and discussions on this issue continue. Some scholars consider that this approach can manifest the role of human agency. However, given a lack of historical observations, interpreting the causes of disasters through event-based perspectives cannot easily reflect the institutional mechanism behind disaster events. Thus, this study applies a social fragmentation concept to represent the opposite of social integration and depicts the trend of social fragmentation based on historical data from 1983-2011 in the Chiayi County, Taiwan. Furthermore, this study overlays the trend of social fragmentation and the flood map at the township level using the GIS technique. Four types of social fragmentation are identified, namely ""continuous high social fragmentation,"" ""transformed social fragmentation,"" ""fluctuating social fragmentation"" and ""continuous low social fragmentation"". The study suggests that the social fragmentation approach can play a supplementary role in measuring the social vulnerability indicator.","Chung Hua Inst Econ Res, 75 Chang Hsing St, Taipei 10672, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Bioind Commun & Dev, 1,Sect 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,,"Peng, LP (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Bioind Commun & Dev, 1,Sect 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.",,,Floods; social fragmentation; social vulnerability; disaster; overlay analysis,10.24850/j-tyca-2017-02-01,Article,VULNERABILITY; RESPONSES; SUICIDE; SUPPORT; AREA,INST MEXICANO TECHNOLOGIAAGUA,TECNOLOGIA Y CIENCIAS DEL AGUA,1,8,ISI,CHUNG HUA INST ECON RES;NATL TAIWAN UNIV,NATL TAIWAN UNIV,A

In the Southernmost Part of the Okinawa Trough (SPOT), a cluster of active submarine volcanoes delineates a volcanic belt, which is located only similar to 100 km above the Wadati-Benioff zone. We report herein new major and trace element data for the SPOT volcanic rocks. These rocks show a compositional range from medium-K andesite to rhyolite. Their geochemical characteristics are similar to those of pre-backarc rifting volcanic rocks from the central Ryukyu arc, and different from those of backarc basin lavas from the Middle Okinawa Trough and the post-backarc rifting Ryukyu arc volcanics. Therefore, despite being topographically contiguous with the rest of the Trough, the SPOT that developed in the Quaternary is not a simple backarc basin but instead an embryonic rift zone in which early arc volcanism occurs as a result of the Ryukyu subduction.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei 106, Taiwan.; Univ Ryukyus, Dept Phys & Earth Sci, Okinawa, Japan.; Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Inst Appl Geophys, Chilung, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;JAPAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,5,1.0,,"Chung, SL (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, 245 Choushan Rd, Taipei 106, Taiwan.",,,,10.1046/j.1365-3121.2000.00298.x,Article,RYUKYU ARC; BASIN; EXTENSION; TAIWAN; ORIGIN,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,TERRA NOVA,55,12,ISI,NATL TAIWAN UNIV;UNIV RYUKYUS;NATL TAIWAN OCEAN UNIV,NATL TAIWAN UNIV,A
2002.0,Terr. Nova,Active continental subduction and crustal exhumation the Taiwan orogeny,Lin C,"A tectonic model of active continental subduction followed by crustal exhumation is proposed to explain the orogeny in Taiwan. The subducted crust is represented by a low-velocity zone dipping eastwards beneath the major part of Taiwan, while the exhumed crust is marked by a high-velocity bulge, high heat flow and absence of seismicity beneath the eastern Central Range. The boundary between the subducted and exhumed crust has been identified from surface geology and analyses of thermal history across the Central Range. The dynamic force that has been driving the exhumed crust is identified by results from focal mechanisms, structural geology and geodetic survey in the eastern Central Range. Such a tectonic model may provide a good explanation for the evolution of the Taiwan Orogeny, as well as an active case for studying other long-extinct systems of continental subduction and exhumation.","Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei 115, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,1,1.0,1.0,"Lin, CH (corresponding author), Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, POB 1-55, Taipei 115, Taiwan.",,,,10.1046/j.1365-3121.2002.00421.x,Article,VELOCITY STRUCTURE; METAMORPHIC ROCKS; HEAT-FLOW; MOUNTAIN; MECHANISM; BENEATH; REGION; UPLIFT; FIELD; WAVE,WILEY,TERRA NOVA,68,14,ISI,INST EARTH SCI,INST EARTH SCI,B1

Field observations and composition analyses of the silicified vein-rich zones beneath the duplex structure suggest that impermeable slate layers may serve as cap rocks for confining deep-seated fluids. These fluids most likely come from the Taiwan metamorphic complex at deeper depths by the dehydration and decarbonation reactions (or partial melting). In addition, the gouge zone of a link fault above the detachment also indicates the presence of overpressured fluids during faulting. It is probable that episodic leakage of the confined fluid reservoirs may provide essential fluids for fault lubrication during earthquake ruptures.","Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei 115, Taiwan.; Cent Geol Survey, Taipei, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,5,1.0,1.0,"Okamoto, K (corresponding author), Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, POB 1-55, Taipei 115, Taiwan.",,,,10.1111/j.1365-3121.2005.00636.x,Article,1999 CHI-CHI; VALVE BEHAVIOR; KOBE EARTHQUAKE; PRESSURE; MECHANICS; SEQUENCE; COMPLEX; EXAMPLE; DRIVEN; ZONES,WILEY,TERRA NOVA,13,17,ISI,INST EARTH SCI,INST EARTH SCI,B2

Despite the absence of present-day glaciers, glacial relicts have been reported in high altitude areas. These scarce landforms provide opportunities for reconstructing the timing of the last deglaciation in a region where glacial history is poorly documented. We have collected boulders and striated bedrocks in the Nanhutashan area and calculated surface exposure ages based on in-situ produced Be-10 concentrations. The oldest glacial remains, dated at 11.1 +/- 3.3 ka, correspond to the last glacial advance. The Holocene is characterized by a continuous retreat of the ice-cap until at least 7.2 +/- 1.0 ka. Our results are in agreement with a scenario where changes of monsoon regimes lead to a strong reduction of the winter monsoon during the early Holocene, causing a decrease of snow supply and disequilibrium of the hydrological budget.","Univ Pual Cezanne, CEREGE, F-13545 Aix En Provence, France.; Cent Geol Survey, Taipei, Taiwan.; Observ Oceanol, Geosci Azur, F-06235 Villefranche Sur Mer, France.;",FRANCE;TAIWAN;FRANCE,FRANCE,FRANCE,7,2.0,1.0,"Carcaillet, J (corresponding author), LGCA, Observ Grenoble, 1381 Rue Piscine, F-38041 Grenoble 09, France.",,,,10.1111/j.1365-3121.2007.00756.x,Article,NUCLIDE PRODUCTION; HALF-LIFE; LAST; RECORDS; SEDIMENT; ISOTOPE; JAPAN; RATES,WILEY,TERRA NOVA,4,19,ISI,UNIV PUAL CEZANNE;GEOSCI AZUR,,B2

In this study, we re-appraise from updated petrological and thermodynamic databases the physical conditions of HP metamorphism in Taiwan, and we combine our findings with available geochronological data to estimate the thermal history of these rocks. Our results indicate that peak metamorphic conditions of similar to 550 degrees C and 10-12 kbar have been followed by a rapid isothermal decompression, with exhumation possibly as rapid as burial. These units have subsequently been stored at a pressure of similar to 3 kbar for similar to 4-5 Myr, before their final exhumation, probably facilitated by the accretion of passive margin sequences during the Late Cenozoic collision. Therefore, HP units in Taiwan maintain a record of processes at depth from the early stages of oceanic subduction to the present arc-continent collision.","Ecole Normale Super, CNRS, UMR 8538, Geol Lab,ENS, F-75005 Paris, France.;  Univ Neuchatel, Inst Geol, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland.;  Univ Paris 07, Inst Phys Globe, CNRS, Paris, France.;  Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei 115, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci Neuchatel, Taipei 10764, Taiwan.;",FRANCE;SWITZERLAND;FRANCE;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,FRANCE,FRANCE,5,4.0,2.0,"Beyssac, O (corresponding author), Ecole Normale Super, CNRS, UMR 8538, Geol Lab,ENS, 24 Rue Lhomond, F-75005 Paris, France.",,,,10.1111/j.1365-3121.2008.00796.x,Article,PHASE-EQUILIBRIUM EXPERIMENTS; THERMODYNAMIC MODEL; EXHUMATION; ROCKS; CHLORITE; NOMENCLATURE; CONSTRAINTS; EVOLUTION; MINERALS; HISTORY,WILEY,TERRA NOVA,44,20,ISI,ECOLE NORMALE SUPER;UNIV NEUCHATEL;CNRS;INST EARTH SCI;NATL TAIWAN UNIV,ECOLE NORMALE SUPER,B2

The isotope analyses of fracture-filling carbonates yielded delta 18O values steadily increasing with depth. The delta 13C values exhibited a pattern similar to that of delta 18O values at shallower depths, but an opposite trend at greater depths. Such variations in the isotopic compositions could be best explained by a mixing of shallow, meteoric water and deeply rooted fluid carrying isotopic signatures of various microbial processes. The notable excursion of delta 18O values might infer a conduit for the lateral fluid transport along the high vein density zone. Overall, the isotopic patterns preclude the substantial influence of early diagenesis and suggest pervasive fluid percolation through the fracture network.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, Taipei 106, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Taipei 106, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei 106, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,6,1.0,1.0,"Wang, PL (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanorg, 1,Sec 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 106, Taiwan.","NSC, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan; NTUNanyang Technological University","We acknowledge the support through the Taiwanese NSC grants and NTU grants to the authors.

We apply these techniques to Miocene (12-6 Ma) sandstones of the Hengchun Peninsula, southern Taiwan, which, based on diametrically opposite palaeocurrents, have a controversial provenance. U-Pb grain ages range from the Miocene (8 Ma) to Archaean (2.5 Ga). Cretaceous thermal cooling is recorded by detrital zircon fission tracks at Loshui and Lilongshan. Permian fission-track grain ages account for <33% of zircon ages from Loshui, while at Lilongshan, Jurassic/Triassic grain ages account for 33-66% of all zircon fission-track ages. Minor (<12%) Miocene age components are detected in both formations. These new data suggest that the primary sources of these Miocene sediments were similar.

The observed thermal data indicate that the strata in the northern Hsuehshan Range underwent dynamic metamorphism during the Neogene orogeny, while the strata in the southern Hsuehshan Range may have predominantly experienced burial metamorphism during Palaeogene sedimentation. Based on the thermal constraints, the Hsuehshan Range is interpreted to consist of nappe stacks, originating from the rifted Eurasian continental margin.

One of the precursors, earthquake migration, has been observed in simulated models and rock experiments, as well as anecdotal observations for large earthquakes along major fault zones. However, there has been no systematic methodology for investigating earthquake migration in nature, and only a small number of studies have observed earthquake migration at large scales. In this work, we show that migration of small earthquakes towards the epicentre before large earthquakes can be visualized. We present a method for detecting small earthquake migration in the spatiotemporal domain, and retrospectively apply it to two recent examples of major earthquakes in Taiwan. We observe that anomalous seismicity occurs increasingly close to the epicentre as the occurrence time is approached. At that point, the bulk of the seismicity concentrates on the epicentre, accumulating stress on the rupture zone and leading to the full rupture. Our findings imply a new type of large-scale pre-seismic earthquake migration pattern that is complementary to the well-studied patterns of source-region activation and quiescence.","Natl Cent Univ, Grad Inst Geophys, Tao Yuan 320, Taiwan.;  Natl Cent Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Tao Yuan 320, Taiwan.;  Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Computat Sci & Engn, Davis, CA 95616 USA.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;USA,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,1.0,"Chen, CC (corresponding author), Natl Cent Univ, Grad Inst Geophys, Tao Yuan 320, Taiwan.","National Science Council (ROC)Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan; Department of Earth Sciences at the National Central University (ROC",The efforts of the CWB of Taiwan to maintain the Seismic Network are very much appreciated.

A 750-volt direct current drives the MRT trains and leaks to the ground, with a maximum value of approximately 1000 amperes measured along the routes. The disturbance is dominated by the unbalanced supply and return currents resulting from the leakage. The daily changes in the magnetic noise levels are correlated with the electricity consumption of the MRT system because the leakage is proportional to the use of electric power.","China Univ Geosci, Hubei Subsurface Multiscale Imaging Key Lab, Inst Geophys & Geomat, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.;  Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Natl Cent Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Jhongli, Taiwan.;  Natl Cent Univ, Inst Space Sci, Jhongli, Taiwan.;  Natl Cent Univ, Ctr Space & Remote Sensing Res, Jhongli, Taiwan.;",CHINA;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,CHINA,CHINA,7,2.0,,"Chen, CH (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci, Inst Geophys & Geomat, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China.","Ministry of Science and Technology, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [103-2116-M-194-015-MY3, 105-2116-M-194 -003]","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, Grant/Award Number: 103-2116-M-194-015-MY3, 105-2116-M-194 -003",,10.1111/ter.12277,Article,GRAVITY-WAVES; SOLAR-WIND; VOLCANO; FIELD; TSUNAMI; ERUPTION; PACIFIC; JAPAN,WILEY,TERRA NOVA,3,29,ISI,CHINA UNIV GEOSCI;INST EARTH SCI;NATL CENT UNIV;NATL CENT UNIV;NATL CENT UNIV,CHINA UNIV GEOSCI,A
2018.0,Terr.

The dating results, distributed from 3.2 to 1.6 Ma with errors ranging from 0.2 to 1.1 Ma, were derived from a combination of two Ar isotopic system end-members with inverse isochron ages of 1.55 +/- 0.05 and 2.87 +/- 0.07 Ma, respectively. Petrographical observations reveal fault melt containing ultracataclasites, therefore the older inverse isochron end-member may be attributed to the relic wall rock Ar isotopic system contained in micro-breccia. Without significant Ar loss expected, the similar to 1.6 Ma for the young end-member defines the exact time of the pseudotachylite formation. Seismic faulting therefore occurred during basement rock exhumation in the Taiwanese hinterland.","Natl Cent Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Zhongli, Taiwan.;  Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei, Taiwan.;  Natl Cent Univ, Inst Appl Geol, Zhongli, Taiwan.;  Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,5,1.0,1.0,"Chen, CT (corresponding author), Natl Cent Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Zhongli, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, R.O.C.Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [106-2119-M-008-023, 102-2116-M-002-027-MY3, 105-2811-M-002-123, 106-2116-M-002-017]; National Central University","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, R.O.C., Grant/Award Number: 106-2119-M-008-023, 102-2116-M-002-027-MY3, 105-2811-M-002-123, 106-2116-M-002-017; National Central University",,10.1111/ter.12319,Article,CENTRAL RANGE; SOUTH CHINA; PSEUDOTACHYLYTE; EXHUMATION; MARGIN; SLIP,WILEY,TERRA NOVA,1,30,ISI,NATL CENT UNIV;NATL TAIWAN UNIV;NATL CENT UNIV;INST EARTH SCI,NATL CENT UNIV,B2

However, the detailed deep structures are not fully revealed because of data resolution problems. The Taiwan Integrated Geodynamic Research (TAIGER) project collected two wide-angle and multichannel seismic profiles across the Taiwan mountain belt (T5) and the western end of the Ryukyu arc-trench system (T6). In this study, we perform 2-D gravity modelling for T5 and T6 by taking advantage of well-constrained P-wave velocity models, which helps to reduce the nonunique problem. To better fit the observed gravity anomaly, a block with relatively high-density must exist beneath eastern Taiwan. This high-density material could be serpentinised mantle, which may be resulted from the dehydration of the subducting Eurasian plate. Also, our result indicates that the subducting Gagua Ridge has a deep crustal root and extends northward to the Ryukyu forearc area.","Natl Cent Univ, Ctr Environm Studies, Taoyuan, Taiwan.;  Hohai Univ, Coll Oceanog, Nanjing, Peoples R China.;  Natl Cent Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Taoyuan, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;CHINA;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,7,1.0,1.0,"Doo, WB (corresponding author), Natl Cent Univ, Ctr Environm Studies, Taoyuan, Taiwan.","Ministry of Science and Technology, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan",,10.1111/ter.12525,Article,,WILEY,TERRA NOVA,0,33,ISI,NATL CENT UNIV;HOHAI UNIV;NATL CENT UNIV,NATL CENT UNIV,B2

Despite the absence of present-day glaciers, glacial relicts have been reported in high altitude areas. These scarce landforms provide opportunities for reconstructing the timing of the last deglaciation in a region where glacial history is poorly documented. We have collected boulders and striated bedrocks in the Nanhutashan area and calculated surface exposure ages based on in-situ produced 10 Be concentrations. The oldest glacial remains, dated at 11.1 ± 3.3 ka, correspond to the last glacial advance. The Holocene is characterized by a continuous retreat of the ice-cap until at least 7.2 ± 1.0 ka. Our results are in agreement with a scenario where changes of monsoon regimes lead to a strong reduction of the winter monsoon during the early Holocene, causing a decrease of snow supply and disequilibrium of the hydrological budget. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","CEREGE, UniversitéPaul Cézanne (Aix-Marseille III), Europôle Méditerranéen de l'Arbois, BP 80, 13545 Aix en Provence Cedex 04, France; Central Geological Survey, 2 Lane 109, Hua-Hsin Street, Chung-Ho 235 Taipei, Taiwan; Géosciences Azur, Observatoire Océanologique, La Darse, BP 48, 06235 Villefranche-sur-Mer Cedex, France; LGCA, Observatoire de Grenoble, 1381 rue de la Piscine, 38041 Grenoble Cedex 09, France",FRANCE;TAIWAN;FRANCE;FRANCE,FRANCE,FRANCE,7,2.0,,"Carcaillet, J.; LGCA, 1381 rue de la Piscine, 38041 Grenoble Cedex 09, France; 電子郵件: julien.carcaillet@ujf-grenoble.fr",,NA NA NA,,10.1111/j.1365-3121.2007.00756.x,Article,beryllium isotope;  cosmic ray;  dating method;  erosion;  glacial landform;  glaciation;  Holocene;  ice retreat;  last glaciation;  Pleistocene;  reconstruction; Asia;  Eurasia;  Far East;  Nanhuta Shan;  Taiwan,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,Terra Nova,4,19,scopus,UNIVERSITÉPAUL CÉZANNE (AIX-MARSEILLE III);GÉOSCIENCES AZUR;OBSERVATOIRE DE GRENOBLE,,R
2017.0,Trans. Inst. Br. Geogr.,State transformation and the evolution of economic nationalism in the East Asian developmental state the Taiwanese semiconductor industry as case study,Hsu J,"This paper empirically highlights the role of nationalism in the development of the semiconductor industry in Taiwan. First, it demonstrates how the pre-1980s Taiwanese developmental state mobilised Chinese economic nationalism against Japanese colonialism and Chinese communism and adopted the strategies of graduated sovereignty, selectively subsidising certain areas and sectors, and promoting national (homogeneously imagined) territorialisation to integrate with the international market. Second, the paper exhibits how in the late 1980s, when the outflow of capital to Mainland China became a compelling phenomenon and Taiwan democratised, popular sovereignty became the norm and Taiwanese nationalism emerged. In response, the democratised state started employing Taiwanese economic nationalism and implementing populist territorial policies to consolidate the support of ‘us’ (the Taiwanese/Taiwan) versus ‘them’ (the Chinese/China). This made China and everything related a security concern that had to be excluded as ‘the other’. This paper responds to the appeals of political geographers to give nationalism a central place in contemporary theories of the nation-state and contributes to the theory of the developmental state by bringing ‘the nation’ back. While most of the existing developmental state literature focuses on how the roles and effects of ‘the state’ influence economic development, taking ‘the nation’ seriously can provide more accurate explanations for how and why the state focuses on development or not. Accordingly, through valuing the nation this paper promotes a theory of the developmental nation-state.

2000.0,Trans. R. Soc. Edinb.-Earth Sci.,Cretaceous fractionated Itype granitoids and metaluminous Atype granites in SE China the Late Yanshanian postorogenic magmatism,Chen C;Lin W;Lu H;Lee C;Tien J;Lai Y,"The Late Yanshanian Orogeny (130-90 Ma) encompasses an important Mesozoic magmatic event in the crustal evolution of SE China. Products of post-orogenic magmatism, widely distributed in the eastern part of Zhejiang and Fujian provinces known as the Southeast Coast Magmatic Belt (SCMB), are dominated by large amounts of slightly Nb and Ta depleted, high-K calc-alkaline granites (I-type) and small amounts of strongly Ba, Sr, Eu, Ti and P depleted, metaluminous granites (A-type). Ar-40/Ar-39 dating from amphiboles suggests that emplacement of A-type granites mostly postdates (94-90 Ma) the intrusion of voluminous I-type granitoids (110-99 Ma). Using the Al-in-amphibole geobarometer, I-type suites were estimated to have been emplaced at shallow depths (5-7km). Along with the fact that A-type granites are phyric or miarolitic in texture, it can be concluded that all these post-orogenic suites in the SCMB belong to shallow intrusives. They have also undergone a rapid cooling (higher than 100 degreesC/Ma at T > 300 degreesC) as indicated by the thermochronology of hornblende, biotite and K-feldspar; therefore, generation of A-type granites from I-type magmas through fractional crystallisation would be a difficult process. Alternatively, their geochemical characteristics are attributed to partial melting in the residual lower crust under an elevated geothermal environment. On the other hand, I-type magmas are considered to be middle-crust-derived melts largely modified with mantle-derived melts that had been depleted with Nb and Ta by earlier tectonic processes. Such a tectonic environment is explained by the underplating of basaltic magmas, most probably due to lithospheric delamination taking place at c. 110 Ma, which marks the beginning of the postorogenic episode in this area. Numerical modelling for a heat source provided by the underplating of basaltic magma supports such a proposition.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geol, Taipei 106, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,6,1.0,,"Chen, CH (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geol, 245 Choushan Rd, Taipei 106, Taiwan.",,,Mafic dykes; post-orogenic magmatism; thermal history,10.1017/S0263593300007379,Article; Proceedings Paper,SOUTHEASTERN CHINA; TECTONIC EVOLUTION; CONSTRAINTS; DEFORMATION; ALKALINE; GEOCHEMISTRY; COMPLEX; TAIWAN; CRUST; ZONE,ROYAL SOC EDINBURGH,TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF EDINBURGH-EARTH SCIENCES,45,91,ISI,NATL TAIWAN UNIV,NATL TAIWAN UNIV,A
2019.0,TransNav,AISassisted service provision and crowdsourcing of marine meteorological information,Chang S;Huang C;Chang S,"Ship navigation and operational activities at sea need meteorological and hydrographic information to enhance safety and efficiency. Besides observations collected from deployed data buoys, marine meteorological information services rely on weather observation reports from ships to increase the data density and thus service quality. Automatic Identification System (AIS), adopted internationally to facilitate ship-ship and ship-shore data exchange, has developed into communication links between ship/shore and buoys with many potential applications. This paper presents AIS applications designed and implemented for marine meteorological information services in a long-term project initiated by the Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan. Achievements of this initiative include: versatile service delivery via shore-based AIS network to shipborne application platforms such as smart phones, remote controllable moving weather data collection, and assisted sharing of weather observation reports from ships. Typhoon forecast and warning is one of the key applications implemented for this region. © 2019, Faculty of Navigation, Gdynia Maritime University.

2020.0,TransNav,A study of correlation between fishing activity and AIS data by deep learning,Shen K;Chu Y;Chang S;Chang S,"Previous researches on the prediction of fishing activities mainly rely on the speed over ground (SOG) as the referential attribute to determine whether the vessel is navigating or in fishing operation. Since more and more fishing vessels install Automatic Identification System (AIS) either voluntarily or under regulatory requirement, data collected from AIS in real time provide more attributes than SOG which may be utilized to improve the prediction. To be specific, the ships' trajectory patterns and the changes in course become available and should be considered. This paper aims to improve the accuracy in the identification of fishing activities. First, we do feature extraction from the AIS data of coastal waters around Taiwan and build a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model. Then, the activity data of fishing vessels are divided into fishing and non-fishing. Finally, based on the testing by feeding various fishing activity data, we can identify the fishing status automatically. © 2020, Faculty of Navigation, Gdynia Maritime University.

2007.0,Veg. Hist. Archaeobot.,A palynological study of environmental changes and their implication for prehistoric settlement in the Ilan Plain northeastern Taiwan,Lin S;Huang T;Liew P;Chen S,"Pollen records from two sediment cores taken from Ilan Plain, northeastern Taiwan provide new insights into the environmental and cultural history of the last 4200 years. The record indicates a relatively warm climate at around 4200 cal B.P. The environmental conditions would have been suitable for people whose settlements and activities were mainly in the littoral zone during this period. However, at ca. 3800 cal B.P., elements tolerant of brackish water dominated the vegetation, indicating that the environment was influenced by marine incursion. The remarkable increase in wetland flora suggests the presence of widespread marshlands thereafter. It is quite conceivable that settlement movement from the fluvial plain to hills between 3800 and 2400 cal B.P. can be correlated with the environmental changes in lowlands. A conspicuous gap in the archaeological sequence between 2400 and 1300 cal B.P. corresponds chronologically with a period of heavy rainfall or frequent typhoons as indicated by the aggradational episode in the Lanyang drainage basin as well as the flourishing of Alnus forests. The persistence of frequent landslides and climate deterioration would have had a dramatic impact on ancient humans and led to abandonment of the settlements. By 1300 cal B.P. a lowland flora is widespread indicating a shift from a marsh to a terrestrial environment in response to a well-developed fluvial plain. Decrease of landslides and the amelioration in climate could have advantages to human activities again. However, both the pollen and archaeological records indicate that intensive colonisation had a profound effect upon the vegetation within the Ilan region about 400 years ago.","Acad Sinica, Inst Hist & Philol, Taipei 115, Taiwan.; Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Plant Biol, Taipei 10764, Taiwan.; Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Geosci, Taipei 10764, Taiwan.; Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Life Sci, Taipei 10764, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,4,1.0,,"Lin, SF (corresponding author), Acad Sinica, Inst Hist & Philol, Taipei 115, Taiwan.",,,pollen analysis; Late Holocene; archaeological site; vegetation history; Taiwan,10.1007/s00334-006-0076-4,Article,NEOLITHIC CULTURES; HUMAN OCCUPATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; COLLAPSE; ARCHAEOLOGY; FALL; RISE; RECORD; LEVEL; AGE,SPRINGER,VEGETATION HISTORY AND ARCHAEOBOTANY,14,16,ISI,INST HIST AND PHILOL;NATL TAIWAN UNIV;NATL TAIWAN UNIV;NATL TAIWAN UNIV,INST HIST AND PHILOL,A

Among 416 snails attached to a substrate, 77.2% were found on the shells of Turritella terebra, which were usually occupied by the hermit crab, Diogene spinifrons. The shell margin of the female C. morbida was more irregular than that of the male. Moreover, C. morbida females on the shells of T. terebra were significantly heavier than those on smaller host shells (mostly Turricula javana and Nassarius clathratus). No such difference was found in males. Female snails were significantly heavier than males. Individuals smaller than 18 mg were all male, whereas those larger than 202 mg were all female. Females had a shorter penis (< 2 mm) than that of the males (> 2 mm). A significant negative correlation between penis length and snail size was found in females but not in males. Brooding individuals were present almost year-round, with the highest occurrence in May. The recruitment of males (< 25 mg) occurred year-round, with a peak in July. Females smaller than 75 mg, on the other hand, were recruited between January and September, with the highest relative frequencies occurring in April. The size difference between sexes and reduction of penis length in females suggests that a life history involving sex change occurs in C. morbida.","Institute of Marine Biology, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, 804, Taiwan",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,,"Soong, K.; Institute of Marine Biology, , Kaohsiung, 804, Taiwan; 電子郵件: keryea@mail.nsysu.edu.tw",,NA NA,,,Article,,,Veliger,7,43,scopus,NATIONAL SUN YAT-SEN UNIVERSITY,INSTITUTE OF MARINE BIOLOGY,A

2018.0,Wetl. Ecol.

Wetlands play a critical role in regional sustainable development because of their ability to enhance resilienceagainst extreme weather events. Maintaining coastal sustainability requires consideration of both the health of coastal wetlands and the resilience of urban systems while mitigating the conflict among social, economic, and environmental goals in land usages around coastal wetland environment. This study investigates a sensitive coastal wetland system located at central Taiwan for demonstration of a sustainable planning practice with an integrated model based on network topology in a socio-ecological context. There are two parts of the integrated model. Whereas a Driving force-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) model helps delineate the complex behaviors among different stakeholders by identifying various indicators, the analytic network process (ANP) quantifies the network topology of DPSIR. According to the survey via questionnaires answered by a group of experts, the DPSIR model is composed of 32 major indicators that can be networked by ANP. The results reveal that an effective ecological conservation depends on a series of mitigation actions, including river and habitat restorations, pollution control, green tourism, and integrated community development via better zoning policies.","Tunghai Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Taichung, Taiwan.;  Natl United Univ, Dept Safety Hlth & Environm Engn, Miaoli, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,5,1.0,,"Chen, HW (corresponding author), Tunghai Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Taichung, Taiwan.","Urban and Rural Development Branch, Construction and Planning Agency, Ministry of the Interior [UR-10228]","The authors would like to thank the Urban and Rural Development Branch, Construction and Planning Agency, Ministry of the Interiorfor financially supporting this research under Contract No. UR-10228.",Sustainable development; Coastal wetland; Analytic network process; Index framework; Conflict resolution; DPSIR,10.1007/s11273-018-9627-6,Article,ANALYTIC NETWORK PROCESS; ECOSYSTEM-BASED MANAGEMENT; SOLID-WASTE; BIODIVERSITY; SERVICES; STRATEGIES; CONSERVATION; INDICATORS; CHALLENGES; FRAMEWORK,SPRINGER,WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,7,26,ISI,TUNGHAI UNIV;NATL UNITED UNIV,TUNGHAI UNIV,A

Rainfall is clearly as important in affecting elver catch as is seawater temperature, which was previously regarded as the key factor.","NATL TAIWAN UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,TAIPEI 106,TAIWAN.; NATL SUN YAT SEN UNIV,INST MARINE BIOL,KAOHSIUNG 804,TAIWAN.;",TAIWAN;TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,3,1.0,,"CHEN, YLL (corresponding author), NATL SUN YAT SEN UNIV,DEPT MARINE RESOURCES,KAOHSIUNG 804,TAIWAN.",,,,,Article,GLASS-EELS; MIGRATION; TEMPERATURE,C S I R O PUBLICATIONS,AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH,11,45,ISI,NATL TAIWAN UNIV;NATL SUN YAT SEN UNIV,NATL SUN YAT SEN UNIV,A

1996.0,,Comparing the IRI prediction with the observed equatorial anomaly in the total electron content around 120 degrees E longitude,Cheng K;Huang Y,"We compare the equatorial anomaly in the Total Electron Content (TEC) we have observed in Taiwan with the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI-90) model. The data were obtained by receiving two coherent radio signals transmitted from the U.S. Navy Navigation Satellite System (NNSS). During low solar activity conditions (1985/1986), only minor discrepancies between the observed and the predicted TEC equatorial anomaly were seen. For high solar activity conditions (1989/1990), however, the anomaly is underestimated by the IRI in winter and equinox. The discrepancies between the observed and the predicted equatorial anomaly are smaller for the CCIR than the URSI set of coefficients. During high and medium solar activities, the strength of the anomaly is particularly pronounced in winter whereas there is no winter anomaly phenomenon found in the IRI model. A hysteresis phenomenon with respect to the solar cycle is observed but not predicted by any of the options in the IRT.","MOTC, DIRECTORATE GEN TELECOMMUN, TAIPEI 106, TAIWAN.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,,"Cheng, K (corresponding author), MOTC, DIRECTORATE GEN TELECOMMUN, TELECOMMUN TRAINING INST, LUPING OBSERV, 180 LUNPING, TAYUAN 328, TAIWAN.",,,,10.1016/0273-1177(95)00933-7,Article; Proceedings Paper,,PERGAMON PRESS LTD,LOW AND EQUATORIAL LATITUDES IN THE INTERNATIONAL REFERENCE IONOSPHERE (IRI),5,18,ISI,,TELECOMMUN TRAINING INST,A

2001.0,,Ionospheric foF2 variations prior to strong earthquakes in Taiwan area,Chuo Y;Chen Y;Liu J;Pulinets S,"Many studies of the seismo-ionospheric coupling effects have been reported. On 17 July 1998(M=6.2), 20 September 1999 (M=7.3) and 22 October 1999 (M=6.4) three large earthquakes respectively struck Rei-Li, Chi-Chi and Chia-Yi in central Taiwan. The three earthquakes severely damaged structures, heavily changed landforms and disturbed geophysical environments. This paper examines variations of the ionospheric penetration frequency, foF2, observed by Chung-Li ionosonde station (25.0 degrees N, 121.1 degrees E) several days before the three earthquakes. The mean- and median-based statistical techniques are introduced to investigate the ionospheric electron density prior to the three earthquakes. Results show that the foF2 decrease significantly before the three earthquakes. (C) 2001 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

2003.0,,Strength properties of flexible geogrids under indoor and outdoor ultraviolet exposure,Hsieh C;Lin C,"The outdoor ultraviolet (UV) light exposure program according to ASTM D5970 and the indoor UV fluorescent lamp device according to ASTM 6154 were used to evaluate the UV degradation in test polyester geogrids. Eighteen months' worth of data were obtained from the outdoor program. UV-A-340 lamps and exposure condition No. 7 were used for the indoor program. The outdoor exposure program was conducted at Pingtung, in southern Taiwan. The annual sunlight exposure energy was 4,263.50 MJ/m(2). The accumulated annual UV-A and UV-B energies were 256.56 and 0.83 MJ/m(2), respectively. The tensile strength of the test geogrids decreased as the outdoor exposure increased, but the decrease in the rate of tensile strength also lessened as UV exposure increased. Carbon black and antioxidants contained in the coating materials have a significant influence on the rate of degradation for the test geogrids; 2% carbon black and 1% antioxidant by weight are recommended. The proportions of average retained ultimate tensile strength for 1 month, 12 months, and 18 months of outdoor exposure were 88%, 71%, and 66%, respectively. The tensile strength half-life cycle due to UV exposure was greater than 18 months. Similar behavior was also observed for the elongation at break. However, no clear trend was found for strength at 5% strain due to UV exposure. The reduction factors due to 18 months of outdoor exposure varied from 1.27 to 1.99. The average reduction factor was about 1.60. The reduction in ultimate tensile strength under 180 h of UV exposure in the indoor UV exposure test program was very significant. However, the rate of lost tensile strength for the second and third 180-h UV exposure was very small. The average retained tensile strengths for the geogrids under 180-h and 540-h exposures were 81 and 77%, respectively. The effect of 540-h fluorescent light exposure on the tensile strength of polyester geogrids coated with polyvinyl chloride was equivalent to 151 days of outdoor exposure at Pingtung.","Natl Pingtung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Neipu, Pingtung, Taiwan.;",TAIWAN,TAIWAN,TAIWAN,2,1.0,,"Hsieh, CW (corresponding author), Natl Pingtung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil Engn, 1 Hseuh Fu Rd, Neipu, Pingtung, Taiwan.",,,,,Article; Proceedings Paper,GEOTEXTILES,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH BOARD NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL,"SOIL MECHANICS 2003: SOILS, GEOLOGY, AND FOUNDATIONS",2,,ISI,NATL PINGTUNG UNIV SCI AND TECHNOL,NATL PINGTUNG UNIV SCI AND TECHNOL,A
2004.0,,Taiwans cooperative space activities at present and in future,Ip W,"Taiwan is developing a long-term space program which is entering its next 15 years of planning cycle. Since its establishment in 1992, the National Space Program Office has played a key role in introducing satellite technology and space experiments into Taiwan. In parallel, basic research in space science and remote-sensing observations are being promoted in different institutions. A combination of these efforts has earned Taiwan a compact but effective space program capable of mounting satellite missions and advanced study in various disciplines of space science. The satellite data receiving and data processing facilities are particularly valuable in addressing issues related to environmental protection, natural hazards and economic planning. At the present time; Taiwan's international cooperative space activities are still very limited in scope but there is a wide ranging of possibilities which could be pursued together with other developing nations in space research under the auspice of COSPAR.

2006.0,,A multispectral spatial convolution approach of rainfall forecasting using weather satellite imagery,Wei C;Hung W;Cheng K,"Flood forecasting has long been a major topic of hydrologic research. Recent events and studies indicate that the success of flood forecasting in Taiwan depends heavily on the accuracy of real-time rainfall forecasting. In this study, we demonstrate a multi-spectral spatial convolution approach for real-time rainfall forecasting using geostationary weather satellite images. The approach incorporates cloud-top temperatures of three infrared channels in a spatial convolution context. It not only characterizes the input-output relationship between cloud-top temperature and rainfall at the ground level, but also is more consistent with physical and remote sensing principles than single-pixel matches. Point rainfall measurements at raingauge sites are up-scaled to pixel-average-rainfall by block kriging, then related to multi-spectral cloud-top temperatures derived from Geostationary Meteorological Satellite images by spatial convolution. The kernel function of the multispectral spatial convolution equation is solved by the least squares method. Through a cross-validation procedure, we demonstrate that the proposed approach is capable of achieving high accuracy for 1- to 3-h-lead pixel-average-rainfall forecasting. (c) 2005 COSPAR.
